Held virtually this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Brown CS welcomed students to our fifth annual CS Research Open House last week. Hosted by the Meta-Undergraduate Research Assistants (MURAs), it offered students an opportunity to learn about research in the department, no matter their year, concentration, or classes they're enrolled in. This year, more than 150 students attended!
You can watch brief introductions from each research group here.
At Brown CS and around the globe, interest in AI and related topics is soaring. CSCI 1470 Deep Learning, only a few years old, today has an enrollment of over 350 students, the department's second largest. But as computer scientists hope to expand the field to historically underrepresented groups (HUGs), students from demographics that have born the brunt of algorithmic bias and deepfakes may be understandably hesitant to take part. A new program aims to change that.
Thanks to an exploreCSR award from Google, Professors Amy Greenwald, Jeff Huang, Daniel Ritchie, and James Tompkin are launching a program for college students from HUGs in CS that will expose them to socially-responsible ways that AI can be used to realize creative visions. Working virtually at first due to the COVID-19 pandemic, students from around the country will become research associates, paired with Brown graduate student mentors (where possible, from similar HUGs) to conduct individualized research experiences, each culminating in a substantial artifact. In short, it's a behind-the-scenes look at how CS research operates, normalized and without pretentions, that students can use as a building block for future careers.

"Brown is uniquely qualified for this kind of experience," says Daniel, "not only due to our diversity and inclusion programs and our efforts to  integrate socially responsible computing across our entire curriculum, but because we're the headquarters of the Leadership Alliance. It's a nationwide consortium of higher educational institutions dedicated to training and mentoring a diverse population of students to take up research leadership positions in academia, industry, and government. CS faculty have mentored visiting students as part of Leadership Alliance programs in the past, and we'll be collaborating with them on this effort (and other upcoming outreach initiatives) to coordinate professional networking and other opportunities for participating students."
Thanks to the department's strong AI and visual computing groups, research topics are many and varied, including creative deepfake detection, mimicking high-end photography, structured image editing, adversarial shape generation, 3D augmented reality sketching, and building AI to play games. Opportunities for projects include literature reviews, replication studies, research apprenticeships, and independent research projects. Although activities will be conducted virtually, the program will culminate in an in-person visit to campus, centered around a symposium in which students present their findings alongside Brown undergrads. 


"I'm excited to see how this 'virtual research associate' approach goes," says Daniel. "It's really different from the typical outreach approach of bringing students in for a short workshop that lasts maybe for a long weekend. I'm hopeful that having a longer timeline, where students get to really experience a research culture over the span of a semester, can have a more lasting impact on attracting students to CS research careers. And we'll still bring students to campus at the end of this experience, for them to meet with their mentors and collaborators and present their research alongside Brown undergrads, as their research peers."
In the middle of a pandemic, some Brown CS alums found a new opportunity to give back. 
Inspired by a neighbor who bought a second monitor to help his mother teach her elementary school students remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, alum Matt Lerner founded Two Screens for Teachers just two months ago. The nonprofit aims to make an immediate impact on the quality of learning during the current online teaching crisis by providing teachers with a second monitor. (Studies indicate that the additional equipment, which can allow teachers to see students on one screen and lesson plans on the other, can improve productivity by 20-30 percent.) His collaborators include two other Brown CS alums, Jesse Kocher and Dave Peck.
Their goal is to distribute 250,000 second monitors to teachers nationwide by the end of 2020, and they recently purchased monitors for all Seattle Public School teachers after raising more than $2M in funding. They're turning their attention now to Brown University's home: the city of Providence, Rhode Island.
Two Screens for Teachers is asking Brown CS alums and anyone else to help provide second monitors for all Providence Public School teachers. You can reach out directly to Matt at matt@twoscreensforteachers.org to donate. 
"There are 3.2 million K-12 public school teachers in the United States," Matt tells us, "and America risks losing a year of educational progress across an entire generation. We need to transform teaching to get our kids through this educational crisis, and we really appreciate your help."
Applying to a doctoral program can be challenging for anyone, and for applicants from historically underrepresented groups (HUGs) who may not have adequate access to research experiences or mentors, it can be especially daunting. It’s thought to be a considerable contributor to the lack of diversity in computer science departments nationwide.
In response, several PhD students from Brown CS have put together a pilot Application Feedback Program for Underrepresented Applicants. It’s an attempt to help address that lack of diversity by putting helpful application resources at the fingertips of applicants from these groups, sharing a variety of best practices and lessons learned.  
Maybe even more valuably, the program also provides extensive mentorship opportunities. They include possibilities such as one-on-one Zoom calls with applicants, graduate student and faculty panels, feedback on statements of purpose and application materials, and answering any questions that applicants may have about the PhD application process.
Since this year has seen a range of organisations and universities offering a variety of support programs for applicants from HUGs in CS, the students also compiled a list of them at the site above to provide easy access. 
“This makes for a very different application process,” say Kweku Kwegyir-Aggrey and Roma Patel, two of the students behind the pilot, “and it’s the kind of thing we wish had been available when we applied. Taking part in our program doesn’t guarantee admission, but we believe that qualified mentorship and ongoing support will prove to be a deciding factor for students from historically underrepresented groups.”
In his newly-released third book, The Alignment Problem, Brown CS alum Brian Christian returns to the intersection of computer science with human ethics and thought. Already winning praise from experts such as Cathy O'Neil, author of Weapons of Math Destruction, it focuses on the consequences of allowing machine learning systems an increasing power to make decisions on humanity's behalf. What ethical and even existential risks emerge when the systems we're attempting to teach act in unexpected and unwanted ways?
"The book," he tells us, "is rooted in four years of research and approximately one hundred interviews with machine-learning researchers, and covers the field's history as well as open problems and recent progress, emphasizing the recent and frequently interdisciplinary work on the ways in which ML systems intersect in complex ways with human norms and values."
Brown CS Professor Michael Littman, whose research in reinforcement learning features in the book, has been following Christian's work closely over the years. "I loved Brian's book on Algorithms to Live By," he says, "and am looking forward to his take on the future of AI." Christian's other prior book, The Most Human Human, explores the ways in which computers are shaping our ideas of what it means to be human. It was a Wall Street Journal national bestseller, a New York Times editors' choice, and was chosen as a favorite book of the year by The New Yorker.
More details about The Alignment Problem are available at Brian's website.
The Department of Computer Science at Brown University is seeking applicants for a tenure-track faculty member at the level of Assistant Professor and a faculty position at the rank of lecturer, senior lecturer, or distinguished senior lecturer. We strive to build a diverse and inclusive environment for all members of our community, and are particularly interested in candidates whose scholarship, teaching and service can further our efforts. Brown also aims to foster a diverse and inclusive environment; its detailed vision and action plan for realizing this commitment is articulated in Pathways to Diversity and Inclusion. 
Brown CS is glad to announce that applications are open for the Randy F. Pausch '82 Computer Science Undergraduate Summer Research Award, which provides $10,000 annually to support an undergraduate engaged in an intensive faculty-student summer research partnership with the Department of Computer Science.
The award is available thanks to a generous gift from Brown CS alum Peter Norvig, now a Director of Research at Google and a thought leader in the areas of artificial intelligence, natural language processing, information retrieval, and software engineering. He was drawn to Brown as an undergraduate by the open curriculum and his interests in computer science and linguistics, which he studied in high school. His gift honors the life and work of Randy F. Pausch '82, a renowned expert in computer science, human-computer interaction, and design who died of complications from pancreatic cancer in 2008 and whose "Last Lecture" has been widely praised. "I didn't know Randy when I was at Brown," Peter says, "but we met afterward and corresponded for many years. His story is inspiring, and this is an opportunity to remember him."
Norvig sees this award as a "multiplier" that will amplify the value of his gift and extend it through time. "I'm interested in students with a wide range of personalities and interests," he says, "and in putting students and faculty together. In the past, we had to build all our own tools, and we didn't have time to combine computer science with other fields. Now, there are so many opportunities to do so. I think it's a wise choice: you invest in things that you think will do good, and educating a student allows them to help add to the things that you're already trying to accomplish." 
Last year, the award went to Casey Nelson and Dylan Sam, who used the funds to work with Professors R. Iris Bahar and Michael Littman on near data processing and weakly supervised machine learning.
To apply, no later than February 14, 2021, students should email Associate Professor (Research) and Vice Chair Tom Doeppner either: (A) a copy of their summer UTRA application or (B) a two-page description of their proposed research and a letter of support from the Brown CS faculty member that they intend to work with.
The Computing Research Association (CRA) and Computing Community Consortium (CCC) have announced a new Computing Innovation Fellows (CIFellows) Program for 2020 that recognizes the significant disruption to the academic job search caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and aims to provide a career-enhancing bridge experience for recent and soon-to-be PhD graduates in computing. Nationwide, only 59 fellowships were awarded (out of 550 applications), and Brown CS has received the maximum number possible for a single institution: Evangelos Atlidakis, a recent Columbia University doctoral graduate, will work with Professor Vasileios P. Kemerlis, and Ben Greenman, a doctoral student at Northeastern University, will work with Professor Shriram Krishnamurthi.
There's an additional Brown CS connection: Morgan L. Turner, a PhD candidate at Brown's Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and collaborator of Professor David Laidlaw, has won a Computing Innovation Fellowship to work with Brown CS alum Daniel F. Keefe, now at the University of Minnesota.
The goal of the program is to create career growth opportunities that support maintaining the computing research pipeline, and it offers two-year postdoctoral opportunities in computing, with cohort activities to support career development and community building for this group of Fellows. 
Last night, the Brown CS community started the semester with a virtual town hall where students learned about upcoming events and deadlines, met new faculty members who talked about the latest courses they’ll be teaching, found out more about research opportunities, and had questions answered.

Two students from Brown University, Andrea Greene-Horace and Yanling He, have just received the CrowdStrike Foundation's NextGen Scholarship, which supports the development of the next generation of talent and leadership in cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. No more than six of these scholarships are given each year, and Brown students have received at least one of them every year that the scholarship has been offered. Andrea and Yanling are students in the Executive Master's in Cybersecurity program, which recently evolved into the Master of Science (ScM) in Cybersecurity.
"I’m honored," says Yanling, "and humbled to receive this award as a Brown student."
"I am very humbled and appreciative for CrowdStrike’s selection as a 2020-21 NextGen scholarship award recipient for use in Brown University’s Cybersecurity degree program," says Andrea. "Brown Cybersecurity is a world-class program. It fosters industry leadership growth by incorporating both scientific methods and proven interdisciplinary frameworks as a basis for solving today’s critical issues, with an eye on emerging cybersecurity and privacy discoveries and disruptions. I've found the program powerful and challenging, which has led to more thoughtful discovery in my own research, application, and growth. It continues to impress me with how it provides regular access to highly relevant, recognized, and sought-after industry and government leaders, commensurate with the classes and topics at hand."
Founded in 2011, CrowdStrike combines advanced endpoint protection with expert intelligence to pinpoint the adversaries perpetrating cybersecurity attacks. Its philanthropic and volunteer arm, the CrowdStrike Foundation, offers a pro bono cybersecurity program for nonprofits, research grants, and the NextGen Scholarship, which provides financial assistance to select undergraduate and graduate students studying cybersecurity and/or artificial intelligence.
Andrea and Yanling were chosen based on a range of criteria that include academic record and courses, experience, and interest in cybersecurity and/or artificial intelligence. They join two prior Brown Cybersecurity winners of the scholarship: George "Donnie" Hasseltine '19 in 2018-2019 and Sarah Lachance '20 in 2019-2020.
"The Brown Cybersecurity faculty is very proud of Andrea and Yanling for their selection as NextGen Scholarship recipients," says Ernesto Zaldivar, Brown CS faculty member and Program Director of Brown's Cybersecurity degree. "The fact that two of our students were selected for this competitive honor – during the same selection period – is a testament to the strength of each of their applications. We're thrilled that the CrowdStrike Foundation recognizes the same promise that we see in Andrea's and Yanling's work."
“The most successful computer vision algorithms of the last few years,” says Chen Sun, “were all built on top of supervised deep learning, where big data and powerful computing devices are the key factors. I’m interested in making machines perceive and learn more naturally, like humans.” Currently a staff research scientist at Google, Chen has just joined Brown University’s Department of Computer Science as a visiting assistant professor, and he’ll become a full assistant professor next July. He’s the newest hire in the multi-year CS With Impact campaign, the largest expansion in Brown CS history. 
One of the reasons why Chen is hoping to change the way machines learn is personal. “When I’m joking with friends,” he says, “I tell them that I have one major goal before I retire: automating everything in my life as much as possible and building myself a robot assistant!” Self-driving cars have been a longtime interest, and one of his recent efforts in this area was an attempt to improve their decision-making through behavior prediction.
In his youth, Chen was an avid videogamer but didn’t find himself immediately drawn to computer science. “I wasn’t quite the standard ‘good student’ according to East Asian culture,” he says. “I often got bored during classes and fell asleep. On the other hand, I worked hard on the topics I was fascinated with.” That atypical experience has provided a lot of insight into pedagogy: “It made me believe that every student is unique and has their own way of learning, and a great teacher can provide a diverse set of tools for different students to choose from and learn most effectively.”
Not learning to code in high school made for a stressful start to college, and it was a year and a half before CS felt comfortable. The two turning points were an algorithm class taught by Professor Xiaoming Sun, who Chen describes as his role model for teaching, and two computer system classes where Chen wrote a compiler and then a mini operating system. “The labs were so nicely designed,” he says, “that after finishing the course I had the skills to build larger software systems and apply them to research projects.”
Chen graduated from Tsinghua University with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, then went on to earn his PhD at the University of Southern California, advised by Professor Ram Nevatia. Video understanding was one of the first subjects to catch his eye. It remains his focus, but Chen says that his relationships with other experts keep his interests broad: “Computer science and AI in general are really interdisciplinary, and computer vision, natural language processing, machine learning, and even cognitive science are all connected – I draw inspiration from people in those areas, and I want to help them as well.”  
As Chen explains it, humans are easily able to distill rich and highly complex information from numerous kinds of videos (documentaries, instructional videos, movies) without supervision, but the process is much more difficult for machines. Inspired in part by his love of cooking alongside his wife, one of Chen’s recent projects (see the paper here and blog post here) involved using an algorithm that discovered human actions and object state transitions automatically by watching people in cooking videos do things and listening to them explain.
“Humans observe the world and then actively explore it,” he says. “I want robots to help us cook, but I want them to learn by watching YouTube, playing around in my kitchen, and asking me for tips, then apply skills that they learned virtually in the real world. I want to close the loop between their perception and their taking action.” 
Also critical, Chen says, is for machines to learn to anticipate multiple futures of human behaviors, whether it’s thinking about varying game strategies or different ways for autonomous vehicles to drive. “That ability to anticipate the future is critical for robots to interact with us,” he says. “It determines whether a self-driving car should yield to pedestrians or not.”
“In the long run,” Chen tells us, “ I’d like to develop algorithms that could discover structured, abstract knowledge automatically from multimodal data, such as videos, websites, speech or music. Such algorithms could lead to smarter softwares, such as an automatic editor for the video of Brown CS faculty singing to graduates. Of course, the ultimate goal is to transfer such knowledge to a robot that can cook me breakfast, drive me to work, and vacuum the house.” 
While that robotic helper is taking shape, Chen is happy to be landing somewhere that reminds him very much of his own undergraduate experience. “I’m getting started as an educator, and Brown is a great place for me.” he says. “The undergraduate teaching assistant and undergraduate research assistant programs at Brown CS are so strong, and I’m really looking forward to getting inspiration from students. The opportunities for collaboration are everywhere – I just read a paper on compositionality by Ellie Pavlick, and it was full of ideas that I could transfer to my research. I love that she’s just down the hall.”
Advising is one of the things that Chen’s looking forward to most: “I really want students to prosper. Taking my experience, helping them be successful – that’s really fulfilling for me. I can’t wait.”

Thanks to a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to a Brown University professor, a high-flying new robotics curriculum is coming to high schools across Rhode Island. 
The curriculum teaches students the basics of robotics in the process of building and programming their own autonomous aerial drones. It was originally developed as a college class by Stefanie Tellex, a computer science professor at Brown. The NSF grant enabled Tellex to adapt the curriculum for high schoolers and provide schools at no cost with the drone parts needed to teach it. This past summer, Tellex trained teachers from 10 Rhode Island schools to teach the course, with the hope that each school will offer it this fall.
“There’s something about flight that captures the imagination,” she said. “The idea here is to use that excitement to introduce students to robotics and artificial intelligence, which can seem a little daunting at first. But these autonomous drones are really good for teaching the basics in a fun way, and we think it’s a great way to get kids interested in STEM.”
The new curriculum is a partnership with Duckietown, an existing robotics education initiative that uses simple, ground-based robots. The new aerial addition to the Duckietown curriculum  is dubbed DuckieSky. 
The DuckieDrone was first developed by Tellex and a group of undergraduates at Brown a few years ago, and Tellex began using the drones to teach introductory robotics in 2017. The drones themselves are small and fairly simple, which Tellex says is by design. She wanted a platform that would be safe and inexpensive, but still sophisticated enough to teach key concepts.
Each quad-rotor drone is equipped with a camera and a small computer processor called a Raspberry Pi. In addition to assembling the drone’s physical parts, students learn how to program the drone to be able to fly on its own. That involves algorithms that help the drone figure out where it is in space and adjust its flight path accordingly. Students also learn key concepts related to safety, networking and communications. 
“One of the key things in robotics is the interaction between the hardware and the software,” Tellex said. “These drones are a great way to bring that all together in a really tangible way.”
Rick Sinard, a computer science teacher at Mount Saint Charles Academy in Woonsocket who participated in the training last month, said he’s excited to bring the curriculum to his school. 
“What this will mean to our students is beyond words,” Sinard said. “Computer science was once thought to be the future, however, it is no longer the future, it is the ‘now.’ This drone program covers the entire STEM program, and is a great addition to our growing CS offerings.”
Other schools participating in the program are Charles E. Shea High School in Pawtucket, Cranston Area Career and Technical School, Cumberland High School, Exeter-West Greenwich High School, the MET High School in Providence, Rogers High School in Newport, Toll Gate High School in Warwick, William M. Davies. Jr. Career & Technical HS, and Smithfield High School. In addition to the 10 Rhode Island schools, Penn Yan Academy in New York State is also participating. In all, the grant will provide the parts to build more than 200 drones to students in these schools.
A group of nine Brown undergraduate students, along with students from other colleges, who are alumni of a drone program piloted at the Providence Career & Technical Academy,  played a key role in helping train teachers, and plan to help out during the school year when the instruction begins. 
“I can’t say enough good things about the Brown students who have been involved in this,” said Diane Silva Pimentel, director of the Master of Arts in Teaching program at Brown. “These students have taken their passion for robotics and are using it to bring more people into that world. The program is fostering tremendous engagement for these students.”
One of those students is Dev Ramesh, who worked on the project this summer as part of an Undergraduate Teaching and Research Award (UTRA) from Brown. Ramesh, a rising junior computer science concentrator, is thinking about a future career in academia, which makes this a golden opportunity for him.
“I have been given the opportunity both to develop the curriculum that we then used to train teachers, and to learn from these teachers about producing and implementing holistic and goal-driven lessons,” Ramesh said. “I believe that my understanding of academic teaching has tremendously improved due to both of these factors, and if I do end up going into academia, this UTRA has set up the foundations for my future success.”
Tellex says she looks forward to seeing a curriculum she’s worked on for years put into action for high school students.
"It's so exciting to empower a group of students with a flying robot and help them on their journey in the path of STEM,” she said. “Our goal is to provide another entry point into STEM that will engage a diverse group of students into autonomous robotics."
"As a disclaimer," says Professor Seny Kamara of Brown CS, "I want to say that this is not a technical talk...so what am I doing here? Why am I giving a talk at CRYPTO if I'm not talking about technical things? I'm here because Ahmaud Arbery was killed in February, because Breonna Taylor was killed by police officers in March, and because George Floyd was also killed by police officers in May."
CRYPTO 2020, which is being held virtually this week, is the world's flagship cryptography conference, sponsored by the International Association for Cryptographic Research. Seny's words above are the start to a very atypical keynote that was shaped by his experience of being Black, an immigrant, an applied cryptographer, and in particular, an outsider: one of perhaps only two or three Black cryptographers in the world.
"My goal is not to convince you that my perspective is the right one," Seny explains, but to share a point of view that he says has not yet been expressed within the cryptography community. In his talk, he takes a critical look at who benefits from cryptography as it currently stands and explores how it can be used to fight oppression and violence: both topics featured prominently in Seny's recent courses, CSCI 2952-V Algorithms for the People and CS 2950-V Topics in Applied Cryptography: Crypto for Social Good.
A recording of the keynote is available here.
Within days of earning a Greek Diaspora Fellowship for work with Internet of Things software hardening, Professor Vasileios P. Kemerlis of Brown CS is making news again. This time, he's won the DIMVA 2020 Outstanding Reviewer Award, which he shares with Fabio Pierazzi of King's College London. Held virtually this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Detection of Intrusions and Malware & Vulnerability Assessment (DIMVA) conference is a premier security forum for advancing the state of the art in intrusion detection, malware detection, and vulnerability assessment. Each year, it brings together international experts from academia, industry, and government to present and discuss novel research in these areas.
The official announcement is available here.
Since the Greek Diaspora Fellowship Program (GDFP) began four years ago, it's provided 123 fellowships to create brain circulation between Greek universities and universities abroad, strengthening capacity at the host institutions and developing long-term, mutually-beneficial collaborations. This year, only three of the 36 awards were in the areas of computer science or computer science education, and one of them has gone to Brown CS Professor Vasileios P. Kemerlis, who shares it with George Polyzos of the Athens University of Economics and Business.
"The field of Internet of Things (IoT) is expanding rapidly," says Vasileios, "and it now includes cars, medical equipment, and other devices with the potential for life-threatening harm. This makes their security essential, but existing software hardening protection solutions may not apply to an IoT setting. Our research will combine my expertise in software hardening with George's expertise in IoT eco-systems, and we'll be working on real-world systems and applications instead of generic scenarios. That combination allows us to focus our effort on attacks that are more likely to occur and more destructive if successful."
Funded by the Stavros Niarchos Foundation and managed by the Institute of International Education in collaboration with the Fulbright Foundation in Greece, the GDFP pairs members of the Greek and Cypriot academic diaspora with higher education institutions and collaborators in Greece to work together on curriculum co-development, collaborative research, graduate and undergraduate research training, and mentoring activities. Fellowships match host universities with scholars and cover the expenses for project visits of between 14 and 90 days, including transportation, a daily stipend, materials allowance, and health insurance.
The collaboration will take place during two visits, with time before and between them used for preparatory and assessment activities, including the sharing of recent research results. During the first visit, Vasileios and George will go through possible software hardening and protection techniques for the IoT setting and make a preliminary assessment of their suitability via estimations and prototyping, while also considering the potential benefits and overheads of each mechanism. They'll select a set of proposed methods for each area (operating system, applications) and create a plan for applying them to the target software and evaluating the results. After the first visit, the two researchers will work on introducing the suggested protection mechanisms to the software components selected, debugging and testing the prototyped code, and then assessing its effectiveness against attacks and its overhead in real use. During the second visit, Vasileios and George will evaluate these results, perform adjustments to the prototyped code, assess their impact, and draw up a report on results that they'll expand on later in co-authored research papers.
"We're really excited," Vasileios says. "Any positive results will be of great value to designers and developers of IoT systems, with considerable impact on the research community that hasn't yet addressed the issues surrounding IoT software. We're looking forward to technology transfer in both directions."
A full list of funded projects is available here.
Held virtually this year, the USENIX Annual Technical Conference (USENIX ATC) brings together leading systems researchers for the presentation of cutting-edge systems research and the opportunity to gain insight into a wealth of must-know topics, including virtualization, system and network management and troubleshooting, cloud and edge computing, security, privacy, and trust, mobile and wireless, and more.
Brown CS Professor Rodrigo Fonseca was an attendee, and he and colleagues from Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Research (Mohammad Shahrad, Íñigo Goiri, Gohar Chaudhry, Paul Batum, Jason Cooke, Eduardo Laureano, Colby Tresness, Mark Russinovich, and Ricardo Bianchini), have won their Community Award, which is given for providing an important new dataset to the community and for the paper ("Serverless in the Wild: Characterizing and Optimizing the Serverless Workload at a Large Cloud Provider") analyzing it. In presenting the award, the organizers remarked that "when such a release is the first of its kind and on a timely topic, as is the case in this paper, it marks an important milestone for the community".
"Function as a Service (FaaS)," the researchers explain, "has been gaining popularity as a way to deploy computations to serverless backends in the cloud. This paradigm shifts the complexity of allocating and provisioning resources to the cloud provider, which has to provide the illusion of always-available resources (i.e. fast function invocations without cold starts) at the lowest possible resource cost. Doing so requires the provider to deeply understand the characteristics of the FaaS workload. Unfortunately, there has been little to no public information on these characteristics."
In their paper, Rodrigo and his colleagues first characterize the entire production FaaS workload of Azure Functions. They show for example that most functions are invoked very infrequently, but there is an 8-order-of-magnitude range of invocation frequencies. Using observations from their characterization, they then propose a practical resource management policy that significantly reduces the number of function cold starts, while spending fewer resources than state-of-the-practice policies.
The paper and a presentation video are available here.
This fall, Srinath Sridhar joins Brown University’s Department of Computer Science as assistant professor. He’s the newest hire in the multi-year CS With Impact campaign, the largest expansion in Brown CS history. Currently a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University, he credits his father, a self-taught user with contagious enthusiasm, for his first exposure to computing. But in some ways, that experience may have been less important than Srinath’s teenaged tinkering with cameras, which set the stage for his future research.
“I was compelled by the idea,” he explains, “of exploring cameras as mechanical devices.” A sense of wonder continues to be a motivating factor: Srinath has been photographing eclipses since 2003, and even traveled to Oregon to see one. “They’re celestial events I can’t postpone, something that’s much bigger than me, and that I’m not in control of. I find that fascinating.” And his early interest in the inner workings of things is still present. One recent personal project offered insight into how plants grow by taking time-lapse photos over many days, watching stems lengthen and leaves uncurl.
“I’ve always been interested in imaging,” Srinath says. “For me, deconstructing images is how I start to understand the world of humans and objects. They’re where my research begins.” 
His primary interests, he explains, lie in 3D computer vision and machine learning, including overlapping topics in robotics, computer graphics, and human–computer interaction. “I develop 3D spatio-temporal machine learning methods that provide human-centric, object-centric, and interaction-centric understanding of our world from videos and images.”
Initially hoping to study computer science after high school, he ended up in geoinformatics, a branch of civil engineering concerned with gathering, processing, and delivering geographic information. Assignments in photogrammetry (extracting 3D information from aerial images of cities and other locales) were a powerful glimpse of what computer vision could offer, and by the end of his undergraduate days in Chennai, Srinath had decided that it was a worthy research topic. His next stop was the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, for a Master’s degree, followed by a doctorate at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics in Germany.
“I was interested in 3D computer vision first,” he says, “but my other interests, like machine learning, came fairly soon afterward.” Among other things, the varied experiences showed Srinath the importance of mentorship: “I was lucky enough to be working in augmented reality before it was considered cool, and in ML before the deep learning craze hit. Part of the reason why that happened was because I had the right kind of mentors to help me figure out what would be interesting to work on.”
That kind of foresight, Srinath explains, is one of the reasons why he’s always felt at home in academia, and it’s something he’s eager to find at Brown. “I want to be around people who are researching long-term problems,” he says, “and the opportunity to teach a new generation of students who have radical ideas that I didn’t think of is wonderful.” 
And the world that this new generation will inhabit, what does Srinath hope it will look like? It’s one in which robots would interact with their environment, and humans with robots, in the natural, unthinking way that we cook a meal or clean our house. We’ve gotten to the point, he says, where it’s easy for computers to beat us at chess or Go, but the challenge is human activities that we don’t associate with intelligence, like loading a dishwasher or folding laundry. 
“One of my drivers,” Srinath tells us, “is to learn from humans in order to help robots perform these everyday tasks, and that means digitizing and examining human physical interactions from visual data–images and videos–so we can build smarter robots, and more immersive virtual/augmented realities. We can’t have them do what we do until we understand how we do it.” It’s a sentiment that recalls his younger self: wanting robots to function like people, Srinath’s analyzing human motion in the same way that he once did the innards of a camera.
“Grasping and manipulation appear so simple,” he says, “but we don’t completely understand how they work. Our hands played a massively important role in the evolution of human intelligence, but there are no robotic hands with human-level dexterity yet.” Over the next five years, Srinath hopes to expand his work on understanding human and object motion to encompass increasingly complex interactions. He’s also looking forward to multidisciplinary work with colleagues in cognitive psychology and other areas, seeing their expertise as vital for the next steps in human-robot interaction.
“My research is often inspired by applications,” he says. “We have pretty good robots and AR/VR headsets, but there are still major computer vision and machine learning challenges left to solve before these devices can interact like humans.” We will eventually have self-driving cars, Srinath explains, as well as realistic AR/VR and robots helping the disabled, but he’s not sure how long it might take for robots to have enough humanlike capability to free their owners from daily chores and let us do something more creative with our lives.
But he likes a challenge. “It might be decades away,” he says. “but I’d like to shorten that!”
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted education at a seldom-seen scale, affecting students and teachers around the world and triggering a learning crisis. In response, next week's Futures Forum on Learning (organized by Schmidt Futures) will bring together leaders in global education and edtech virtually to discuss critical areas of need and opportunity. At 7 PM EDT on Monday, July 20, Professor Kathi Fisler of Brown CS and Bootstrap will take part in a panel discussion ("Should COVID-19 Change Our Expectations About What Math is Taught") with Steven Levitt, author of Freakonomics, and Ruthe Farmer of CS for All, former Senior Policy Advisor for Tech Inclusion at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.
“Even before COVID, people were talking about the need for more data science content in K-12”, Kathi says. “COVID has both inspired many people to look at data and illuminated the challenges of shifting instruction online. In our session, we’re looking forward to discussing how to infuse more data science into K-12, within the broader conference context of the learning environment.”
More information on the Futures Forum on Learning, including details on how to register for this free event, can be found here.
Brandon J. Woodard, a Brown CS doctoral student advised by Professor David H. Laidlaw, has just won the NASA RI Space Grant Fellowship for 2020-2021, which provides stipend support for young researchers working toward their Master's or PhD degrees in a NASA-related field of study. Given by the NASA Rhode Island Space Grant Consortium, it will fund his research involving novel methods of modeling data of Earth's forests collected with the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation LiDAR (GEDI), a remote sensing instrument aboard the International Space Station (ISS). It's the first step, Brandon says, of a multi-year plan of working on CS research that supports NASA's strategic goals.
"Space exploration and planetary sciences have been lifelong interests," Brandon tells us, "and my curiosity was especially fostered after multiple field trips to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in grade school. As I toured JPL's campus I was very interested and intrigued by the amazing projects, like the Mars exploration rovers and Cassini. I learned that at the core of each of these missions, computers and computer science research were imperative to the mission's success. When I finally got the opportunity to intern at JPL, I realized how critical data is to NASA and learned that the majority of decisions and inferences made are through the interpretation of scientific data. In order to interpret data correctly, researchers need to be able to visualize and intuitively understand the information accurately – otherwise, a lot can go wrong. I gradually developed a fascination for visualizing data and decided to research scientific visualization." 
In his research, Brandon and his advisor propose to develop inferential models that will improve LiDAR-derived estimates of forest structure. Their research will increase the utility of the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) instrument aboard the International Space Station and other large-footprint (large LiDAR beam; common for space-borne devices) LiDAR instruments through better data modeling. Capturing the underlying geometry and biology by utilizing GEDI LiDAR data that is unused in current methods of forest structure estimation will make this possible. Their research will provide ecologists with a better understanding of important carbon processes, biodiversity, and habitat of forests. The resulting research will positively impact NASA’s efforts in remote sensing and ecology for overall terrestrial health.
"My hope," Brandon tells us, "is that developing better methods to model Earth surveying data will provide scientists with a better understanding of Earth as a system, in particular the carbon processes, biodiversity, and habitats of forests."

Brown CS alums Deqing Sun ‘13 (currently a research scientist at Google) and Stefan Roth ‘07 (currently a professor of computer science at TU Darmstadt), along with Brown CS adjunct faculty member Michael Black (currently at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems), have won the Longuet-Higgins Prize for their paper on optical flow estimation. Deqinq has also won the PAMI Young Researcher award (shared with Jon Barron of Google Research) for his contributions to computer vision.
The PAMI Young Researcher award is given out by the IEEE Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI) Technical Committee, and aims to recognize young researchers who have made groundbreaking advances in computer vision within seven years of completing their PhD. The Longuet-Higgins award is presented by the IEEE Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI) Technical Committee at each year’s CVPR, a premier annual computer vision event, for fundamental contributions in computer vision. The award recognizes CVPR papers from ten years ago with significant impact on computer vision research. 
Deqing, Stefan, and Michael’s award-winning paper was written in 2010, when both Deqing and Michael were at Brown University, and focuses primarily on the reasons behind recent advancements in the accuracy of optical flow estimation algorithms. The trio attempted to uncover the drivers behind these advancements via a thorough analysis of how the objective function, the optimization method, and modern implementation practices influence accuracy.
In a recent retrospective blog post, Michael explains the journey behind his research and reminisces about some of his key takeaways from the process. “I’m still happy with this one and I feel so very fortunate to have had great students like Deqing and Stefan as collaborators and friends,” he explains. “That is the final, true, 'secret' of this paper: work with great people who you like, and enjoy the process.”
Professor Pedro Felzenszwalb of Brown CS and Brown's School of Engineering was also a winner of the Longuet-Higgins Prize in 2018.
In recent years, software defined networking has exploded in popularity as programmers have made a concerted effort to move the control plane (which handles traffic sent to a device or generated on the device) to a logically centralized machine. This development has led to breakneck innovation in the field of computer networking, and Professor Theophilus "Theo" A. Benson of Brown CS has seized the opportunity to explore even newer horizons. 
“Programmable data planes are essentially Lego blocks that can be built together and made into whatever you want,” Theo explains, “and they are responsible for packet processing and forwarding on network devices.” Programmable data planes are used for high-speed packet processing when handling packets that pass through a device and the forwarding logic it's capable of executing is mutable. It's this aspect that Theo’s work focuses on – exploring the programmability of these data planes. 
“Recent efforts to develop reconfigurable data planes and high-level network programming languages have made it possible to truly program the data plane – in other words, to change the way packets are processed on network devices,” says Theo. “The ability to fully program the network – both control and data plane – is expected to have a profound impact on the field of networking in the coming years.”
What inspired Theo to work on this field of study? For him, it was the limitless potential afforded by such technologies: “I had this idea of having programmable networks, cloud infrastructures that are robots, clouds that automatically figure out what their problems are and fix themselves, figure out resource allocation – with programmable networks we are a step closer.” Theo’s research has increasingly focused on this topic, with recent work including a workshop paper laying out the vision for programmable data planes, another paper discussing methods for debugging the data planes, a recent Eurosys paper exploring possible speed enhancements for this networking technology, and a keynote delivered at the International Workshop on Edge Systems, Analytics, and Networking. 
With such rapid progress, where would Theo say this research is headed in the future? “Well, we’ve started to look at some machine learning,” he says, “and we’re looking into discovering intelligent algorithms to put things together, and into figuring out how to make the network configure itself to make this dream happen.”

In the inaugural Analog Devices Real-Time Sensor Fusion Challenge, sponsored by MassRobotics, teams from Massachusetts and Rhode Island were invited to compete and submit projects that fuse at least two sensor inputs, using the Robot Operating System (ROS) to create a system that provides better context awareness in robots. Brown’s Actuated Robotics Guidance Systems team, which consisted of Brown undergrads Jung Yeop (Steve) Kim, Mckenna Cisler, and Howon Lee, advised by Professors George Konidaris and Stefanie Tellex, won First Place and were awarded $40,000. Their competition included not only fellow undergraduates but teams made up of graduate and post-graduate students.
The team explains that although falling is the leading cause of death for people over the age of 65, the aid and care devices used to support them have not improved over the past few decades. They designed an actuated walker that allows a user to walk naturally while the walker adjusts itself to the user's pace, keeping them safe and stable. Their approach uses multiple sensors to detect the center of mass of the user, as well as their intent (sitting down, going uphill or downhill, and so on) to autonomously brake/accelerate the walker to adjust its position relative to the user.
Their work can be found on this website and a demo video can be found here.
"Advising this team was a real privilege. When everything had to go virtual because of the pandemic, they simply accelerated their timeline. The resulting video really showed how the walker prevents falls," says Stefanie.
"It's really wonderful to see students being so creative, and working so hard, to design something that could really improve people's lives," adds George.
Although only the three students participated in the competition, the Actuated Walker team has grown into an interdepartmental effort across College Hill, consisting of professors, PhD and Master’s students, and undergraduates in Brown’s School of Public Health, Medical School, Department of Computer Science, and School of Engineering, as well as RISD’s Department of Industrial Design.
“We were able to get input from Brown’s School of Public Health from early on in the project, and we wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for their continuous advice,” says Jung Yeop (Steve). “Brown’s culture of interdepartmental collaboration really pushed our project forward, and we’re not sure if we could have pulled this off anywhere else.”
“Our project is a unique combination of the hardware challenge of building a usable, sensor-equipped walker with the software and robotics challenge of intelligently actuating the walker to keep the user from falling,” says Mckenna. “Having team members and advisors from both these sides has really helped us build a well-integrated and capable walker system.”
Hannah Dunnigan is studying Industrial Design at RISD. “Our collaboration and breakthroughs on the walker project demonstrate a larger interdepartmental cooperation,” she says, “a strong partnership between Brown and RISD, and an ever-evolving connection between research and design.”
Facebook recently announced the recipients of their research awards on privacy-preserving technologies and the role of applied cryptography in a privacy-focused advertising ecosystem. Out of 164 proposals submitted, the company chose 14 winners, which include a Brown CS faculty member and two alums. A third alum was a finalist in the competition.
These interconnections demonstrate a long Brown CS tradition of research and teaching on all aspects of cryptography, anonymity, privacy and security, ranging from studying theoretical foundations to building real-world systems. Anna, for example, was Foteini's doctoral advisor, and Brown CS Professor Roberto Tamassia, also a faculty member with the Master of Science in Cybersecurity program, advised both Charalampos and Olya. Charalampos, in turn, was Yupeng's advisor.  
“Selecting winners from this impressive set of proposals was not easy,” says Sharon Ayalde, Facebook's Research Program Manager, Academic Relations. “We look forward to seeing the outcome of the research described in these outstanding proposals and to collaborating further with these experts.”
The full list of winners and finalists is available here.
Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) is pleased to announce that two of its faculty members received named chairs at the May, 2020 meeting of the Corporation of Brown University. Michael Littman is now the Royce Family Professor of Teaching Excellence in Computer Science and Ellie Pavlick is now the Manning Assistant Professor of Computer Science.
Awarded for terms of three years each, and renewable for one successive term, Royce Family Professorships recognize, reward, and encourage innovation and excellence in teaching among the Brown University faculty. The Manning Assistant Professorships were established by Martha Sharp Joukowsky, Class of 1958, LHD 1985, and Artemis A. W. Joukowsky, Class of 1955, LLD 1985, parents of Michael W. Joukowsky, Class of 1987, and they honor James Manning, Brown's first president.
"I'm very flattered to have been chosen," Michael says.  Given Brown's deep commitment to education, it's quite humbling and a little intimidating to have an official title that shines a spotlight on 'teaching excellence'."
Littman earned his doctorate from Brown CS in 1996 and has been a member of the faculty since 2012. Currently co-directing Brown's Humanity-Centered Robotics Initiative, he works mainly in reinforcement learning, but has done research in machine learning, game theory, computer networking, partially observable Markov decision process solving, computer solving of analogy problems, and other areas.
Michael has earned multiple awards for teaching and research and has served on the editorial boards for The Journal of Machine Learning Research and The Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research. He served as General Chair of the International Conference on Machine Learning and Program Chair of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) Conference in 2013. He's also an AAAI Fellow and was Co-Chair of the recent Reinforcement Learning and Decision Making Conference, held last year in Montreal. Mostly recently, he was named an ACM Fellow and an AAAS Leshner Fellow.
"I am extremely flattered," Ellie tells us. "It's such a privilege to be a part of Brown's community – the department is supportive, the students are bright and curious, I really couldn't imagine a better place to be building a lab."
Pavlick received her PhD in Computer and Information Science from University of Pennsylvania in 2017 and joined the Brown CS faculty in the same year. Her current research is in Natural Language Processing, specifically on computational models of semantics and pragmatics that emulate human inferences.
Also a research scientist at Google AI, Ellie won the *SEM Best Paper Award ("So-Called Non-Subsective Adjectives") and received a Facebook PhD Fellowship ("Meaning Variation in Paraphrase") in 2016. Most recently, she was a keynote speaker at the 2019 International Conference on Computational Semantics (IWCS) and gave invited talks at the 2019 New England Machine Learning and Harvard Linguistics Universals Colloquium Series. She was also Team Co-Lead for the Workshop on General Purpose Sentence Representation Learning at the 2018 Johns Hopkins Summer Workshop on Language Technology (JSALT) and Area Chair of Sentence-Level Semantics for the Association for Computational Linguistics in the same year.
Ellie and Michael join seven other holders of Brown CS endowed professorships: Eugene Charniak (University Professor of Computer Science), Maurice Herlihy (An Wang Professor of Computer Science), Sorin Istrail (Julie Nguyen Brown Professor of Computational and Mathematical Sciences and Professor of Computer Science), George Konidaris (John E. Savage Assistant Professorship in Computer Science), Roberto Tamassia (Plastech Professor of Computer Science), Eliezer Upfal (Rush Hawkins Professor of Computer Science), and Andries van Dam (Thomas J. Watson, Junior University Professor of Technology and Education and Professor of Computer Science).
Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) is reporting another record-breaking graduating class. According to Vice Chair Tom Doeppner, Brown CS graduated 297 undergraduate students, its highest total ever, as well as 89 Master's students and eight PhDs.
"297 students is a 14.7 increase over last year," says Tom, "which in turn saw a 4% increase over the prior year. We're already Brown's most commonly chosen concentration, and enrollment is not only still growing but accelerating."
39% of the undergraduates are women, a figure that's almost twice the national average.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Brown CS saluted its graduates virtually, creating a website of celebrations that included congratulatory posters, slideshows, historic photos from the Brown CS Digital Archive, and a video of faculty members singing a Gilbert-and-Sullivan-inspired song. The video has since gone viral, earning thousands of views and praise from Ruthe Farmer, formerly the Senior Policy Advisor for Tech Inclusion at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.
Brown CS PhD student Jing Qian (advised by Brown CS Professor Jeff Huang) has been working at Adobe Research to develop a means to bridge the gap between physical and digital documents with augmented reality (AR) technology. His work has culminated in the creation of Dually Noted, which gives users the ability to annotate documents and then view the annotations in real time as an AR overlay over the actual physical document. These annotations can be shared directly and immediately with other users, and users can then view the annotations by simply hovering their phones over the text in question.
“I really first became interested in this field when I collaborated on my first AR project in the MIT fluid interface group,” Jing explains. “And then I met Jeff at Brown, I found the ideas to be really interesting, and I decided to come work with him.” This has led to Jing specializing in Human Computer Interaction and subsequently joining the HCI Research Group. “Jing has been exploring the area of mixed reality interaction through his PhD,” Jeff says, “and he can build almost anything.”
But why did HCI appeal so much to Jing? For him, it was the unique opportunity to work at the intersection of design and technology, giving users the ability to unlock the full potential of the tools at their disposal. “In general, if we have a really cool piece of technology, whoever developed it can use it very well,” Jing says, “but for real-life impacts and real-life benefits we need to expose this technology to users. HCI works to provide a really good methodology and systematic set of ways so that the technology can be used by all kinds of people.” 
Jing brought those ideas of innovation to Adobe, where he played a pivotal role in the design and development of their Dually Noted software. “I noticed that people are shifting to digital document consumption, but at the same time this leads to a loss in the tangible experience of physical mediums,” says Jing. “I wanted to find a way to preserve and combine the physical reading experience and the digital experience.”
Jing has undoubtedly accomplished a great deal through his work at Adobe, but he has even greater plans for the future. One aspect that especially interests him is the integration of user behavior data with AR. “It would make sense to get user behavior data and actually customize AR interfaces based on their behavior,” he explains, “and I want to continue working on using AR to bridge the gap between technology and its users.”

Brown University has just announced the award of $350,000 in a new COVID-19 Research Seed Fund, and three Brown CS faculty members are among the recipients. Brown established the fund to fast track innovative research proposals that directly address the urgent needs of the COVID-19 pandemic. The grants focus on projects that best support research with potential significant, rapid impact on human health and create products of immediate need for the health care system in Rhode Island and the nation.
Along with the project lead, Dr. Harrison Bai (Diagnostic Imaging), Brown CS Professor and Department Chair Ugur Cetintemel and Professor Ritambhara Singh of Brown CS and Brown's Center for Computational Molecular Biology are the investigators of a grant for research that will develop an AI platform to differentiate COVID-19 from other viral pneumonia on chest CT, and use the information to identify early-stage patients who are likely to transition to severe disease.
Brown CS Professor Sorin Istrail is Co-PI of a grant led by Primary Investigator Elizabeth Chen of the Brown Center for Biomedical Informatics that will establish an inter-institutional informatics infrastructure to support COVID-19 research in Rhode Island through electronic health data, digital health technology, and data science techniques. The other CO-PIs are Philip Chan (Medicine), A. Rani Elwy (Psychiatry and Human Behavior), Fizza Gillani (Medicine), Joseph W. Hogan (Biostatistics), and Indra Neil Sarkar (Brown Center for Biomedical Informatics and Rhode Island Quality Institute).
A full list of recipients is here and a News from Brown story about the grants is here.
Brown CS has just announced that it will recognize 17 graduating seniors for their achievements this year. Evan Cater, Min Jean Cho, Tyler DeFroscia, Megan Gessner, Brad Guesman, Samuel Hinthorn, Shawna Huang, Brendan Le, Joshua Levin, Zhengyi Peng, Heila Precel, Lena Renshaw, Shoshana Simons, Henry Stone, Andrew Wagner, and Solomon Zitter will each receive the Senior Prize in Computer Science for their academic work as well as their service to Brown CS. The prize will also be awarded posthumously to Will Povell.
"Along with Eleanor Avril, who won the Norman K. Meyrowitz '81 Award, these are our top students," says Associate Professor (Research) and Vice Chair Tom Doeppner. "As a group, they've done superior work, but we were also very impressed with how generously they were able to give back to the department and their fellow students."
"Brown CS has been a home for me for the past four years," says Solomon. "Between all the late nights (which often stretched into early mornings) at the CIT, the fantastic friends I’ve made, and the incredible learning I’ve done, I couldn’t have asked for a better way to spend my time at Brown. I've especially cherished the opportunity to give back to the department and reinforce my own learning through TAing and HTAing a wide variety of courses, experiences which I believe would have been nearly impossible if it weren’t for the unique structure of this department. I also was lucky enough to have the chance to get involved with Professor Philip Klein’s research group, where I have been able to develop new skills and new ways of thinking."
Joshua and Shawna also mention the importance of community. "I’m so grateful for the opportunity," Joshua tells us, "to have learned to love CS in a community so welcoming, supportive, collaborative, and inspiring." Shawna says that she's made lifelong friends, taken challenging courses, discovered new passions, and grown as a person. "It's also been so rewarding to help other students as a TA, HTA, and MTA," she tells us. "It's truly been a privilege to give back to this community and make a difference for the next generation of students."
Zhengyi focuses on the transformational aspect of computer science: "What always fascinates me, both in being a TA and doing web development, is that we can make knowledge and service more accessible, liberating from discriminations and prejudices."
Finally, Lena echoes many of her fellow students with thoughts that turn to classmate Will Povell: "I’m incredibly thankful to have had such a supportive environment to learn computer science in. I’m humbled to share this award with my extraordinary peers, especially Will, who I know all of us miss incredibly."
Brown University's Department of Computer Science has just announced that Eleanor Avril, a Brown CS student and one of the four Meta-TAs who coordinate the Undergraduate Teaching Assistant program, has just won the Norman K. Meyrowitz '81 Award. Named for an alum known for his contributions to the department, the award recognizes exceptionally meritorious service to Brown CS and is accompanied by a cash prize of five hundred dollars.
"We are delighted to say that it is warranted this year," says Brown CS Professor Tom Doeppner, Vice Chair and Director of Undergraduate Studies, "for Eleanor's dependable eagerness to help out in any situation, and for doing so ever so competently and cheerfully."
Norm Meyrowitz feels similarly. "It was an honor to have this award named after me years ago in the Triassic period of CS," he says, "and it is even more of an honor to have someone as deserving as Eleanor receive it.”
Lorenzo De Stefani is the most recent hire in the multi-year CS With Impact campaign, the largest expansion in Brown CS history. One of the most fortunate things in his early life, he tells us, was the strong relationship that his father, an electrical engineer, had with his former university advisor. “It gave me this idea,” says Lorenzo, “of universities as being a little bit magical.” 
Having successfully defended his doctoral thesis last month, he’s returning to Brown CS in the fall as lecturer. It’s time for him to be part of that magic in a different way, and he’s looking forward to meeting his new students and sharing his love of intellectual challenge. “I like hard questions,” he says, “and the freedom of thinking that theory allows. It helps you appreciate the other things you do, and we lose something without it.”
A native of Treviso, in Italy, Lorenzo studied computer engineering at the nearby University of Padova in a class of 120 students, only six of whom were women. “There’s much more diversity and varying social dynamics in America,” he says. “For some Europeans, the differences can be scary at first, but I see them as interesting. They make me want to learn more about what’s happening and follow the political discourse. As an instructor, diversity leads me to make my course content as approachable and inclusive as possible.”
Originally drawn to computer engineering by his curiosity about how and why computers work, Lorenzo’s interest was soon piqued by the theoretical aspects of computer science, and he met Professor Gianfranco Bilardi, who later became his Master’s and PhD advisor. Most interesting to him, Lorenzo says, were the fundamental questions of how to characterize computation with restrictions in resources, particularly memory. “It’s not too fashionable these days,” he says, “and it can be intimidating to see how the list of experts in this area intersects with a list of Turing Award winners. But it’s a very good mental gym. I’m still actively working on these topics.”
Today, Lorenzo’s research focuses on statistical learning and algorithms for knowledge discovery from big data with probabilistic guarantees. He describes himself as a multitasker, interested in analysis of statistical properties of time series and designing algorithms for large graphs, as well as modeling user preferences given incomplete rankings and visually representing data. 
As someone with a wide scope of interests, he found Professor Eli Upfal of Brown CS to be an ideal advisor: “I’m used to having a broad range of research activities. Eli is great at fostering initiative and curiosity in his students, and he encourages them to pursue their research interests, provided that they’re sound and significant. Instead of being hyper-specialized, he’s a master of a very versatile and important toolkit, which is applying probability to computer science.”  
That being said, we hope Eli can forgive us for speculating that he was only the second most important person that Lorenzo met in Providence. Beginning his doctoral work in 2014, his very first conversation in the CIT was with fellow PhD student, Megumi Ando. They soon began dating and were married two years later: Lorenzo’s plans of getting his degree in four years and returning to Italy were quickly altered. Together, the couple enjoys watching Netflix documentaries and cooking food from around the world. Of course, Italian cuisine abounds in Rhode Island, but does it match what Lorenzo was used to at home? “The food is more like ‘Italian-inspired’ here,” he says charitably. “More of a fusion.”
Lorenzo will be teaching CSCI 1010 Theory of Computation and co-teaching CSCI 1570 Design and Analysis of Algorithms with Roberto Tamassia this fall. His prior experience with CSCI 1010 has left him eager for more. Last year, he explains, a fire alarm went off a half-hour before the final session of class ended. Expecting only a handful of students to return after the sirens were silenced, he was delighted to see that all but one came back inside for the final minutes. “Our students are very interested,” he says. “They engage with their TAs, and they want to be TAs. Given an opportunity, they always want to participate.”
Lorenzo also intends to continue researching and pursuing grants, seeing them as ideal ways to recruit undergraduate research assistants. “I’m lucky enough to have more ideas than time,” he says. “I want to share those ideas with students and see where they go with them.”
As a former Brown CS student, he also has the rare perspective of someone who’s seen our doctoral program from within. “Brown takes very good care of its students,” he tells us, “but being a PhD student is stressful. Providing them with a good support structure is so important, especially for international students – I knew that any time I had an issue, I could go to Lauren Clarke, who could give me advice or fix something for me in hours, not days. Students also need good advisors who are able to distinguish between effort and success.”
“Talking to students is something I really enjoy,” he says, “and I’m always happy to do it. I have a certain amount of expertise in various topics, and a lot of projects fall under those areas. I like talking about research, especially with people who have different interests, because I always learn something from how they approach things.” 
In particular, he says when we press him on the subject, he’s looking forward to sharing his love of theory and of truly challenging projects. “I have maximum respect for the more experimental tracks of computer science,” Lorenzo says, “but I prefer being able to think about my work at any time of day, without going into the lab. Not every problem I work on has to be a big one, but I like the ones that push us out of our comfort zones. When we get through them, we’re better equipped – and it’s more satisfying.” 
The longest continuously running graphics group in the known universe, Brown Visual Computing, has just released a new website, https://visual.cs.brown.edu/. Dating back to 1966, the group is currently composed of Brown CS Professors Jeff Huang, John "Spike" Hughes, David Laidlaw, Barbara Meier, Daniel Ritchie, James Tompkin, and Andries "Andy" van Dam and their student advisees and researchers. They develop technology to make and make sense of visual data, leveraging both principled physical models and data-driven methods to synthesize, edit, and explain visual data. The new site shares the group's research vision, lists their PhD alums and current courses, provides publication links and open-source code links, offers a Twitter feed to share the latest Brown Visual Computing news, and even contains a few graphics-related easter eggs.
Less than a year after his arrival at Brown, Professor Malte Schwarzkopf of Brown CS has received a Richard B. Salomon Faculty Research Award. The award, given annually by Brown’s Office of the Vice-President for Research, was established to support excellence in scholarly work by providing funding for selected faculty research projects of exceptional merit with preference given to junior faculty who are in the process of building their research portfolio.
Asked to situate his research, Malte explains that comprehensive data protection laws such as the European Union's recent General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) better protect citizens' sensitive data, but impose a high cost for compliance on organizations that operate digital services. The expense, he says, comes partly because retrofitting compliance onto current computer systems is difficult, manual, and time-consuming.
"In this project," Malte tells us, "we seek to understand where current software abstractions and common practices come into conflict with laws like the GDPR, and to develop new computer systems designs that address these problems and make data protection a primary design concern. One example will restructure the databases that web services use today as federations of per-user micro-databases. Users can add or remove their personal micro-database at any time, and all data related to them are stored in their personal micro-database. Applications – such as a social network or an e-commerce site – then combine different users' micro-databases into what database literature calls 'views' computed over their combined information (e.g. a list of top rated posts). These views and the derived information they contain change automatically as the underlying set of micro-databases changes (e.g. because a user unsubscribes her data). One of the major challenges for this research is to design and build software systems that can build and maintain such views over hundreds of thousands or millions of micro-databases with the same performance that today's software delivers over a single database."
Malte hopes to build a Brown-based research group that turns this idea into a real system, and to build collaborations both with industry and non-CS academics interested in data protection. Currently, Brown has isolated centers of interest in data protection legislation and its impact, but this effort will seek to bring them together.
"This project," Malte says, "will unite these groups, introduce industry and off-campus perspectives, establish Brown as a household name in this emerging field of research, foster interdisciplinary thinking in the Brown spirit, and seek to create new technology that makes data protection a primary design goal."
A full list of awardees is available here. Malte joins multiple previous Brown CS winners, including (most recently) Theophilus A. Benson and George Konidaris. 
Brown CS PhD student Lucy Qin (advised by Brown CS Professor Seny Kamara) has just received an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship for her work in applied cryptography. The award is the oldest graduate fellowship of its kind, and aims to recognize and support outstanding graduate students in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math.
Lucy’s previous work focused on the design and implementation of secure multi-party computation, which allows mutually distrustful parties to jointly compute functions over their private data. Her research has contributed to projects that span a wide variety of applications, including one that evaluates the pay gap in Boston and another that aims to build a solution for detecting serial perpetrators of sexual misconduct. Looking forward, Lucy is working with Seny and others in the Encrypted Systems Lab to build a novel cryptographic protocol that will aid policymakers in advocating for explicit privacy guarantees in an upcoming piece of legislation.
“I’m inspired by how cryptography can be used as a tool in rearranging power and would like to focus on projects that prioritize the privacy needs of groups traditionally overlooked in technology design,” Lucy says. “My hope is that this fellowship will open up greater opportunities to conduct interdisciplinary research and assess the technology I’m building through a more holistic and critical lens.” Lucy joins eight other prior Brown CS winners of the fellowship, the most recent winner being Jeff Rasley.
Professor Donald Stanford '72 ScM '77 of Brown CS has just been recognized for his dedication to student mentoring, particularly with aspiring entrepreneurs, with the Hazeltine Mentoring in Entrepreneurship Award. Founded by a group of alums, it honors Professor Barrett Hazeltine, who has been mentoring and inspiring Brown University students for decades.
"Don was one of the first people in my career to take me under his wings and show faith in me," remembers Adi Dhandania, now Vice-President of Strategy and Corporate Development at Twin River Worldwide Holdings and currently an Executive Master's student in EMSTL. "Going back 10+ years ago, I still remember the joy and excitement I would get from listening to the engaging stories that Don would share at intern lunches. His enthusiasm and commitment to teach and develop young professionals is unparalleled. His mentorship goes far beyond entrepreneurs and has made a significant difference for students as well as early-career, mid-career, and late-career professionals. His support of me has been invaluable to both my personal and professional growth, and I will always be grateful for that."
Jack Roswell, co-founder of Cloud Agronomics and another of Don's mentees, feels similarly: "Don is revered by many due to his technical expertise, kind heart, and keen eye for talent. My first encounter with Don was nothing short of serendipitous, and put simply, I wouldn't be where I am today if he had not taken me under his wing."
In addition to teaching and mentoring students for decades, Don is a founding member of GTECH (now IGT Global)  and began working for the start-up company in 1979 as Manager of Software Development when it had less than 10 employees. Over 40 years, he has held every technical leadership position in the organization, including Vice President of Advanced Development, Chief Technology Officer, and Chief Innovation Officer. Don guided the growth of GTECH’s technology organization from a software staff of four to its current worldwide deployment of over 1,200 technology professionals. Under his leadership, GTECH advanced the state of the art in transaction processing, secure retail systems, and wireless communications, enabling it to lead the Gaming industry worldwide and install systems in over 80 jurisdictions on six continents. Don serves on several boards, including YearUp Rhode Island, Spectra Systems, and the Business Innovation Factory. He is also a past member of the Rhode Island Science and Technology Advisory Council and a co-founder of Times2 STEM Academy, Rhode Island’s very first K-12 charter school.
In 2001, Don was appointed Adjunct Professor of the Practice in Computer Science at Brown, and he's been teaching undergraduates since 2002. He's also an Adjunct Professor in the School of Engineering and in the School of Professional Studies, where he teaches Science and Technology Leadership. In the past he has served on the Brown advisory councils to the President and the School of Engineering. In 1999, Don received the Black Engineer of the Year Award for Professional Achievement and the Honorable Thurgood Marshall Award for community service from the NAACP. In 2002, he received the Brown Graduate School’s Distinguished Graduate Award and the Rhode Island Professional Engineer’s Award for Community Service.
"I am truly honored," Don tells us, "to be mentioned in the same breath as the legendary Barrett Hazeltine. I have known Barrett since I was a freshman student at Brown in 1968 and have followed his meteoric success in fostering entrepreneurship studies and activities at Brown over the past decades. On many occasions I have been contacted by a Brown student whose first words were, ‘Barrett Hazeltine sent me.’ For me, it is a gift to be able to interact with students in developing their vision for ideas that have potential impact on our society. It is a great time to be at Brown and I am grateful for the opportunity in my retirement to participate in the overall effort and ecosystem that makes Brown such a special place. Being able to teach and work at Brown allows me to return to school and learn something new every day from colleagues and students. The slogan 'Ever True to Brown' are words that I take to heart.”
This year's other award winner is Professor Jennifer Nazareno of the School of Public Health and the Nelson Center for Entrepreneurship. Don and Jennifer will receive their awards in a virtual ceremony on Thursday, April 30, at 4 PM. If you're interested in attending, please RSVP here, and a Zoom link will be sent to you.

One of the keys to safely ending COVID-19 lockdowns across the country is contact tracing — identifying people who have been exposed to the virus to prevent them from spreading it. A Brown University computer scientist is part of an international research team trying to enable contact tracking with smartphones in a way that preserves everyone’s privacy.
Anna Lysyanskaya, a professor of computer science and a cryptography expert, is working on an MIT-based project called PACT: Private Automated Contact Tracing. The team is developing a system that uses the Bluetooth signals that smartphones exchange all the time to track which devices have come in close contact to each other. The system makes it possible to notify people that they may have been in contact with an infected person, but without revealing any private information to other individuals, the government, health care providers or cellular service companies.
Lysyanskaya says that a system like this helps to strike a balance between the need to track infections and the need to preserve people’s privacy.
“I think that this time when people are dying and everybody’s stuck at home, it’s tempting to say, ‘well let’s give up privacy; let’s give up human rights; let’s give up democracy’ — anything to stop this,” she said. “But we need to not yield to that impulse. We can do automated tracing, which could really improve outcomes for containing this disease, while preserving privacy.”
Lysyanskaya discussed the details of the project in an interview.
Tracing contacts without any assistance from an automated system is a very labor-intensive process. And relying on human memory to recall who have I interacted with, where have I been is less than perfect. That’s especially true when someone has just been diagnosed with a devastating disease. They might not be able to recall everything they’ve done in the last few days when they were spreading the infection. Anything that can relieve the burden from the sick person to have to recall things — and also from medical professionals who are extremely busy — is very advantageous. Automated contact tracing can do that.
There are many ways that you can do automated contact tracing that aren’t very private. You could just carry around a device that exchanges contact information every time it comes in a close enough range to another device. That way if you exchanged information with someone who was infected, you could find that out. But that would not be a good idea from the point of view of privacy because now you know everything about everybody you run into. 
We’ve been working on doing contact tracing in a way that, as much as possible, doesn’t intrude on people’s privacy. 
The goal of this project is to record interactions but without leaving any identifying information about yourself behind. The way it works is that instead of providing your contact information, you just provide a completely random string of bits, called chirps. These chirps are produced by BLE, or Bluetooth low energy. It’s a technology that’s similar to what you use, for example, to attach Bluetooth-enabled devices, like headphones. 
What we’re proposing is an app that stores all the chirps that people’s phones send and receive. So if I’m diagnosed, I can simply tell the app about it, and it will take all the chirps I’ve emitted over the past 14 days and publish them to a database. Everybody who has this app installed is connected to this database. At regular time intervals, the app compares the database of chirps from infected people with their locally stored chirps. If there’s an overlap, then that person knows they may have been exposed and they should contact a health care provider.
The important thing is that these chirps are just strings of random numbers that don’t identify you in any way. They’re meaningless in the absence of anything else happening in the system. But if somebody is diagnosed with the disease, and they let the app know that, then the chirps become useful. We can then tell if we’ve contacted an infected person without knowing who they were.
First of all, with GPS there are issues about whether you’re revealing someone’s location, which is problematic in terms of privacy. But there are other issues. My understanding is that GPS coordinates just don’t give you fine-grained enough information about how close you were to somebody. Bluetooth on the other hand is designed to work over a small range, so it’s a pretty decent proxy for how far you are from another person.
And your phone is automatically generating these random strings in connection with Bluetooth, so it’s something we can take advantage of.
Last week Apple and Google announced that they’re providing support in their operating systems for the type of contact tracing apps that rely on these Bluetooth chirps. They make the operating systems for the vast majority of devices out there, so that’s a big step. 
From there, the app has to be created, and we’re still thinking about the best technical approach for that. Once the app is ready, the question becomes how do we get it on peoples’ devices. One way is that it could be included in your next operating system update. If Apple and Google are willing, then it will happen by itself. If they weren’t willing to push an app like that, then maybe individual states or jurisdictions might say, ‘You need this app’ and put out advertisements telling people to download it. That would be much more difficult, because people don’t just install apps because you tell them to.
But first we need to have an app and it needs to be usable. Then we can worry about how we get people to use it.
The group I’m involved with has its gravity center at MIT, specifically Ron Rivest, who was my Ph.D. advisor a long time ago. At some point I was one of those people who said, “Oh you’re doing this? Here are my ideas for how to do this even better.” The group just kept growing and growing. 
This is an amazing effort and really inspiring. For the last few weeks I've been stuck at home getting stir crazy and a little bit depressed. But this has jerked me out of that. Not everybody has an outlet like this. I’m very lucky that I work in a field that gives me this kind of an outlet where I can feel happy, even in these circumstances. For those people who have an outlet like this, use it. It’s going to make you feel great.
A recent Brown Daily Herald article provides the story behind a new online replica of the Brown University campus. A joint effort between Brown Esports and Geopipe, it's already providing a valuable service to prospective students during the COVID-19 crisis.
Thomas Dickerson, a Brown CS alum, is a co-founder of Geopipe, which builds algorithms to turn 2D and 3D data into highly detailed 3D virtual models. "We initially heard what Brown Esports was planning from an undergraduate intern over the summer," he tells us. "At the time, there was no pandemic on the horizon, so it mostly seemed like a fun and quirky way to participate in the Brown community. That's especially true because Geopipe's roots are in a project that my co-founder and I collaborated on several years ago to  reproduce Manhattan at a 1:1 scale in Minecraft."
When the pandemic hit, Thomas says, the project took on new urgency: "We're hoping it will provide prospective students with a way to get a feel for Brown. Obviously, the CIT is my favorite building on campus, so I took special care to make sure it was reproduced well."

Brown University undergraduate Nishanth Kumar, a Computer Engineering concentrator and Brown CS researcher, has recently received the Barry Goldwater Scholarship for his research into Learning from Demonstration (LfD). The scholarship was established by Congress in 1986 to identify and support the next generation of research leaders, and is widely regarded as one of the most prestigious undergraduate scholarships in the natural sciences, mathematics, and engineering in America. Nishanth joins fellow Brown students Adam Tropper (Physics and Astronomy concentrator) and Lucas Sanchez (Chemistry concentrator) this year as a scholarship recipient.
Nishanth’s research focuses on teaching robots to learn real-world skills directly from observing demonstrations. “LfD allows non-expert operators to program skills simply by demonstrating them many times,” he explains, “and these learned skills are more general: they are able to handle slight variations of a task, such as if an object to be placed is slightly misplaced.” The issue with current LfD techniques, however, is that they train skills that are unable to target specific goals from many possible choices (i.e. targeting a specific button within a grid) without copious amounts of training data. 
“To combat this issue, I helped propose a method that learns skills that are parameterized by a goal parameter,” Nishanth says, “such that altering this parameter correctly alters the skill. In the button pressing scenario, instead of training a new skill for each button, we train one general skill that adapts itself depending on where the button is.”
Looking forward, Nishanth is ready to continue solving some of the most practical problems in Artificial Intelligence: “After winning the scholarship, I’ve felt a deep responsibility and motivation to continue my research into AI and robotics. I believe the advent of intelligent, collaborative robots can massively change the world for the better and I hope to play some part in making this dream a reality.”
Chosen by an esteemed panel of Brown University faculty, Professor Michael Littman of Brown CS has just been given Brown's Distinguished Research Achievement Award. Now in its fourth year, the Research Achievement Award program is supported by the Office of the President and the Provost to nurture and recognize the extraordinary research contributions of faculty. Michael is the first Brown CS recipient of the award, which comes with a one-time $5,000 research stipend.
Michael has earned multiple awards for teaching and research and has served on the editorial boards for The Journal of Machine Learning Research and The Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research. He served as General Chair of the International Conference on Machine Learning and Program Chair of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) Conference in 2013. He's also an AAAI Fellow and was Co-Chair of the recent Reinforcement Learning and Decision Making Conference, held last year in Montreal. Mostly recently, he was named an ACM Fellow and an AAAS Leshner Fellow.

Game playing has long been a subject of fascination within the AI field, and Brown CS Professor Amy Greenwald recently hosted a AAAI Panel, “Advancing AI By Playing Games”, with some of the most influential figures in this specialty. The speakers included Dr. Michael Bowling of the University of Alberta (leader of the research group that built the first poker playing AI to beat professional players), Dr. Murray Campbell of IBM (member of the team that developed Deep Blue, the first computer chess program to defeat a world champion), Garry Kasparov (world-renowned chess grandmaster), Dr. Hiroaki Kitano (CEO of Sony Computer Science Laboratories), and Dr. David Silver of University College London (leader of the AlphaGo project, the first computer Go program to defeat a world champion). These individuals are responsible for some of the most pivotal advancements in Game-Playing AI. 
“They are incredibly inspiring people,” says Amy when asked about her experience hosting such a star-studded panel. “All of them are really deep thinkers.” This natural curiosity for learning is clearly evident in their work, research that has been crucial in driving the break-neck speed of discovery in AI. “They work on problems for which success is not guaranteed,” explains Amy. “It is a high risk/high reward enterprise.”
Why has there been such a fascination with game-playing AI in particular over the past several decades? “Well, we all love playing games,” laughs Amy, “but beyond that, being good at playing games and solving puzzles has always been a sign of intelligence.” She explains that success at game-playing serves as a benchmark of human intelligence; likewise, it provides a definitive way to measure just how “smart” an AI really is. “The speed of discovery is increasing at an astronomical rate. There are multitudes of people in countries like China and India, and these countries prioritize and emphasize computer technology.”
Even with such rapid development, game-playing AI has encountered a number of challenges that have yet to be overcome. “Most of the successes have been in two-player zero-sum games, where there is a winner and a loser. Games with more than two agents, and general-sum games –that have both competitive and cooperative elements– are very, very challenging,” explains Amy. Even with these obstacles, however, the future of AI is bright. “Dr. Kitano’s Robocup organization has set a goal of robots winning the world cup in soccer by 2050. The kind of teamwork required to play soccer well may translate well, for example, to disaster response, and there are many other real-world applications for game-playing AI.”
The Randy F. Pausch '82 Computer Science Undergraduate Summer Research Award, given this year to Casey Nelson and Dylan Sam to support their work with Brown CS Professors R. Iris Bahar and Stephen Bach, respectively, recognizes strong achievement from undergraduate researchers and offers them the opportunity to continue their work over the summer.
A generous gift from Peter Norvig '78 (a Director of Research at Google and a thought leader in the areas of artificial intelligence, natural language processing, information retrieval, and software engineering) established the award, which provides $10,000 annually to support an undergraduate engaged in an intensive faculty-student summer research partnership. The gift honors the life and work of Randy F. Pausch '82, a renowned expert in computer science, human-computer interaction, and design who died of complications from pancreatic cancer in 2008. "His story is inspiring," Peter says, "and this is an opportunity to remember him."
Casey explains that she began collaborating with Iris last summer. “She was my first year advisor, and talking with her about her work during our advisor meetings led to me joining her project last summer.” Casey’s research focuses on using near data processing (NDP) as a solution to the memory wall problem, which is the bottleneck in performance due to the increasing gap between memory access speeds and processor speeds. “Using NDP involves making hardware modifications (like moving processing closer to memory) and software modifications to take advantage of these hardware changes,” she describes, “and we specifically focus on using NDP to optimize concurrent, pointer chasing data structures, whose poor cache locality causes bottlenecks which NDP might be able to eliminate.”
How might Casey’s work be used in the real world? It seems like there are a variety of possibilities. “Currently, I’m working on applying these NDP data structures to realistic applications to get a measure of the real world benefits,” she says, “and I’m specifically looking into applications in databases and security.”
Dylan, on the other hand, began working with Steve his sophomore spring. “I started out reading papers and discussing them, focusing on the deeper underlying theories behind machine learning models,” he says, “and I gained an appreciation of his background in weakly supervised machine learning, which I was immediately interested in.” This interest led to Dylan focusing on weakly supervised machine learning for his research project. “In modern machine learning applications, models require large amounts of labeled data,” he explains, “and weakly supervised learning looks to solve this bottleneck and find other solutions when labeled data is not readily available.” 
More specifically, Dylan’s work focuses on the underlying theory behind why weakly supervised strategies work. “Steve and his collaborators at Stanford have worked on projects including Snorkel, which empirically show that these weak supervision strategies perform well,” Dylan explains. The biggest issue, Dylan says, is that these strategies miss a theoretical explanation as to why they work. How exactly does Dylan plan to solve this problem? Well, it really requires a multifaceted approach. “My project first looks to survey the field, searching for inspiration for a new theoretical approach. Next, I will apply their strategies on difficult computer vision tasks to fully understand and demonstrate the workings of the algorithms. Finally, I’ll develop a theoretical justification for why these strategies work.”
With summer coming soon, both Casey and Dylan tell us that they can’t wait to begin work on their proposals. “I’m very excited to pursue this research over the summer, and I’m very grateful to Iris for allowing me to get involved on this project,” says Casey. Likewise, Dylan tells us that he plans to use this project as a springboard to really explore his interests. “This award will allow me to further dive into my research in preparation for PhD programs,” he says, “and I’m thankful to Steve, the BATS lab, and the TA2 group for continuously inspiring me and driving me to pursue my research.”
Casey and Dylan’s eagerness and curiosity are exactly what Peter Norvig is looking for. He sees this award as a multiplier that will amplify the value of his gift and extend it through time. "In the past," he says, "we had to build all our own tools, and we didn't have time to combine computer science with other fields. Now, there are so many opportunities to do so. I think it's a wise choice: you invest in things that you think will do good, and educating a student allows them to help add to the things that you're already trying to accomplish."
"High-quality virtual 3D objects," says Professor Daniel Ritchie of Brown CS, "are a critical resource for many academic disciplines, as well as for industries such as CAD and furniture and displays like the Hololens and MagicLeap. Unfortunately, traditional processes for creating new 3D objects are ill-equipped to meet this demand, and alternate approaches can be time-consuming, expensive, and require expertise, or fail to produce high-quality geometry."
To help remedy this problem, Daniel has just received a National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER Award to develop 3D generative models that satisfy the criteria of quality, variety, efficiency, interpretability, economy, and universality, enabling scalable synthesis of high-quality objects for the expanding set of applications that demand them. His solution is neurosymbolic 3D models, a new class of generative representation for 3D objects that combines the best features of both symbolic and neural models.
"The main insight," he explains, "is to use a symbolic program to model the logical part structure of a 3D object, and then to use neural networks to refine this structure into high-quality geometry. This representation supports synthesis of new objects, reconstruction of objects from real-world sensor input, and high-level editing of object structure and geometry. It also supports modeling of higher-order object properties, including kinematics and physics."
The end goal is not only to create these high-quality objects but to help democratize 3D content creation and enable massive-scale generation of synthetic 3D training data for vision and robotics. This includes releasing augmented datasets with neurosymbolic versions of objects, improvements to robotic perception systems, and educating a new generation of diverse researchers with the interdisciplinary skillset needed for neurosymbolic 3D modeling.
CAREER Awards are given in support of outstanding junior faculty teacher-scholars who excel at research, education, and integration of the two within the context of an organizational mission, and Daniel joins multiple previous Brown CS winners of the award, including (most recently) George Konidaris, Theophilus A. Benson, Stefanie Tellex, and Jeff Huang.
Brown CS is happy to announce that Jeff Huang has been promoted to Associate Professor with tenure (pending the approval of Brown's Corporation), effective as of July 1, 2020.
Jeff came to Brown in 2013 after receiving his PhD and Master of Science in Information Science from University of Washington at Seattle. He also worked in various industry positions over the course of a decade, including Senior Software Engineer at Yahoo and co-founder of WorldBlender, a Techstars-funded startup, and he holds a record with ten tech internships at Google, Microsoft, and Motorola.
Alexandra Papoutsaki, one of Jeff's doctoral advisees, is now an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Pomona College, and she's delighted by the news. "The first thing that pops in my mind," she says, "is that he's an incredibly kind human, always seeing the best in the people around him. Jeff gave me the room to grow and experiment and was always willing to help me and encourage me during our meetings. Seeing how he approaches research was eye-opening: he pursues hard questions that have a larger societal impact instead of looking for immediate gratification and the easy road. His energy in the classroom is palpable and infectious and I often look to his dedication to high-quality teaching for inspiration for my own teaching. Even after my graduation, he's always there for me: sharing teaching and research material and offering his perspective on how to navigate my career."
Jeff's Brown HCI research group specializes in creating personalized applications from remotely-captured user behavior data. Some of their recent projects include Sochiatrist (a social extractor that automatically dumps and anonymizes social communication data and combines it with biomarker data and qualitative interviews done by clinical researchers to find correlations), Self-E (a guided self-experimentation app), and WebGazer (an eye tracking library that uses common webcams to infer the eye-gaze locations of web visitors on a page in real time).
In addition to giving more than twenty invited talks over the past five years, Jeff has served as Conference Program Chair of CHIIR 2018, Conference Track Chair of SIGIR 2018, Conference Local Chair of WSDM 2012, and served on the Editorial Board of the Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology (JASIST). Some of his recent honors include an Army Research Office Young Investigator Award, being chosen as a CHIIR 2017 Best Paper Finalist, and an NSF CAREER Award.
Brown CS Professor Theophilus “Theo” A. Benson has just won the Eurosys  Best Student Paper Award for co-authoring the paper, “Efficient and Safe Network Updates with Suffix Causal Consistency” (authored by University of North Carolina Chapel Hill student Shen Liu and also co-authored by UNC Professor Michael Reiter), presented at EuroSys 2019. EuroSys is one of the premier systems conferences worldwide, focusing on issues related to systems software research and development, network middleware, database systems, real-time systems, and distributed, parallel, or embedded computing systems.
“Though centrally managed by a controller,” the authors explain, “a software-defined network can still encounter routing inconsistencies among its switches due to the non-atomic updates to their forwarding table. These inconsistencies can allow attackers to circumvent security appliances or lead to dropped packets which impact performance. In this paper, we proposed a new method to rectify these inconsistencies that is inspired by causal consistency, a consistency model for shared-memory systems. Applied to SDNs, causal consistency would imply that once a packet is matched to a forwarding rule in a switch, it can be matched in downstream switches only to rules that are equally or more up-to-date.” The authors focused on a functionally equivalent version of this property called suffix causal consistency, and showed that SCC provided greater efficiency than other competing consistent-update alternatives. 
The International Automated Negotiation Agents Competition (ANAC) is now in its tenth year of bringing together researchers from the negotiation community and spawning novel research in the field of autonomous agent design. Most recently, it was held at the International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) in Macao in August of 2019, and Brown CS PhD student Enrique Areyan and Professor Amy Greenwald returned home with the second place award in the competition's Supply Chain Management League.
The goal of this particular league is to design and build an autonomous agent that acts as the virtual manager of a factory who needs to buy raw materials, turn them into finished products, and then sell them. The goal is to maximize profit given private production capabilities, but the challenge for the researchers is that all transactions happen via automated negotiations between autonomous artificial agents.
"Our agent," says Enrique, "takes inspiration from the newsvendor model, a classic model in operations research used to model the choice of an optimal inventory level for a perishable product (for example, a newspaper). Analogous to newsvendor models, our agent tries not to over-produce or under-produce during its planning horizon. The ideas is not to stock too many products, as any excess (whatever does not sell) will go to waste; but at the same time not stock too few, as any shortage will result in lost sales. The goal of our agent is to maximize its total expected profits over a finite time horizon, in the face of uncertain and non-stationary elastic demand." 
The competition is returning again in 2020, and the SCML rules have been simplified so that agents can focus less on factory scheduling and production, which made up most of Enrique and Amy's focus in 2019, and more on agent negotiation strategies. The SCML 2020 game description can be found here.
More information about Enrique and Amy's agent is available here.
Brown CS alum Feng-Hao Liu, now assistant professor at the College of Engineering and Computer Science at Florida Atlantic University, has just received an NSF CAREER Award, titled “CAREER: Towards Efficient Cryptography for Next Generation Applications”. The topic of his research, he explains, is homomorphic computation, physical attacks, lattices, and post-quantum cryptography. "I would like to develop more analytical techniques and mathematical tools," he tells us, "to improve efficiency of the current states of the arts, hopefully making some of the constructions practical."
Feng-Hao would like to acknowledge Brown CS as a wonderful place where he developed as a researcher. In a message to Professor Anna Lysyanskaya, his PhD thesis advisor, and Professor John Savage, Feng-Hao says, "I appreciate the time when I was studying at Brown. Thank both of you for creating such a great environment that makes doing science a cool thing!"  
Looking back on the past few years, it’s difficult to remember a month or even a week when blockchains weren’t making news. But in the wake of various cryptocurrency crashes, have we reached Peak Blockchain? Not even close, say three computer scientists whose work may help fuel considerable speed increases for the technology as its reach expands far beyond Bitcoin and its competitors.
“With blockchains,” says Maurice Herlihy, An Wang Professor of Computer Science at Brown University, “we have a Volkswagen engine because that’s the way things evolved out of necessity. Our research is trying to replace it with a Maserati.”
That speedup, he says, is particularly important when we consider the many industries looking to benefit from blockchain’s reliability and decentralization. “Most people aren’t going to become cryptocurrency speculators, but blockchains could someday be used for everything from monitoring the freshness of produce to trading stocks to tracking items that move through the planet’s biggest supply chains. They’re conceivably a good fit for any interaction in which parties have a discussion process and are interested in coming to a conclusion.”
But first, there’s a big hurdle to overcome: there’s only one bathroom, so to speak, and one key.
“If we use Bitcoin as an example,” says Assistant Professor Eric Koskinen of Stevens Institute of Technology, one of Maurice’s collaborators, “it’s simple: you have some money, you can break it into smaller pieces, and you can transfer those pieces to other people. Other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, have built on this by offering smart contracts.” 
Smart contracts are small programs associated with transactions, he explains, so you could have your money transfer automatically when the moon is full on a Thursday. Because they don’t require functionaries to get involved, they add a great deal of versatility. Unfortunately, they also present a massive bottleneck. To avoid conflicts, all smart contracts, even unrelated ones, only operate one at a time.
“In the beginning,” Maurice explains, “blockchains worked that way for simplicity’s sake, because it was easier to program. For an analogy, think of a thousand people wanting to buy concert tickets at the same time, and the software doesn’t want two people getting the same seat. When you’re picking your seat, you have a lock on the database, just like a bathroom lock that only lets one person in at a time.”
So, how to get around that limitation? Inspiration came in the form of transactional memory techniques, which allow for easier and faster development of programs that operate simultaneously. Maurice and Eric had collaborated on some of these methods, such as transactional boosting, as far back as 2008.
“We felt like the ideas that went into transactional memory would be a good fit for adding concurrency to smart contracts,” says Eric. Ethereum data, he explains, is stored in a structure known as a hash table, and Ethereum transactions are built by reading from and writing to the hash table. “Our work detects when simultaneous transactions might try to access the same part of the hash table, and pauses smart contracts to ensure that they proceed carefully. In this way, you can make high-level statements like ‘X and Y are independent’ and then the system finds a way to let them happen at the same time.” A bit of advance planning and coordination, in other words, can ensure that smart contracts interact with minimal fuss. 
This idea led to a paper (and a patent application) with Thomas Dickerson (Brown CS PhD '19, advised by Maurice with Eric also on his committee) and Paul Gazzillo.
Maurice and Eric needed to evaluate the effectiveness of their methods, but implementing them across the entire Ethereum virtual machine would have required a massive effort. The next best option? A simulation, which could model the effect that transactional memory techniques and concurrency might have. That’s where Vikram Saraph (now at Facebook, he earned his PhD from Brown with Maurice as his advisor) entered the picture.  
“A blockchain’s transactional data is never thrown out,” he says, “which makes it a historian’s paradise. So to evaluate how concurrent execution techniques might work in the future, I applied them to smart contracts from earlier in Ethereum’s history.” 
It was a bit of archaeology in the service of better engineering, focusing on the period of time from July of 2016 to December of 2017. After looking at the Ethereum source code, Vikram thought about what he wanted to re-execute in parallel and then created his simulation, which walks through the instruction sets of the smart contracts to see what would affect simultaneous execution. The goal was to see a speed increase.
“But in simulations,” he explains, “you don’t have an obvious measure for time. As a proxy, you can think about what instructions cost, because certain instructions require a payment to Ethereum. It’s a hypothetical way of evaluating the speedup.”
The results were striking: in the earliest part of the simulation, when conflicts were minimal, speed increased eightfold. But then the adorable kittens interfered.
Initial coin offerings (ICOs) are the blockchain version of stock offerings, and one of the most popular was CryptoKitties, which let users trade virtual cats. Due to the amount of contention as the same smart contracts were used again and again, some ICOs reduced the speedup from eight times to two times. But workarounds were still possible: by ignoring a small set of high-contention contracts and focusing on running others concurrently, Vikram was able to increase the speedup back to four or five times.
“That showed us a possible way forward,” Maurice says. “In the future, we can take steps to mitigate high-contention activity and add instructions to the Ethereum instruction set to allow some operations that otherwise wouldn’t be able to run in parallel to do so. For example, instead of two contracts trying to increment the same variable, the contracts could communicate with each other beforehand, so the database is only accessed once.” 
Eric and Maurice are looking forward to refining their techniques in the days ahead. Historical code, they explain, doesn’t provide a complete understanding of what was actually going on, so there’s more work to be done to evaluate whether a perceived conflict actually is one. It’s that idea of replacing a Volkwagen engine with the Maserati, says Maurice: making things run faster with a minimum of fuss. And to do it transparently, in a way that will work for any blockchain that uses smart contracts.
As time goes by, Maurice sees the importance of blockchains growing in parallel with the expansion of machine learning and an increasing interest in personal data ownership. “Blockchains could provide a more explicit and transparent way for people to control their data,” he says. “For example, they could serve as a data market where you selectively sell data from your smart devices to insurance companies.”
And more and more, the researchers believe, the public’s need for speed will motivate their work and those of their colleagues in the years to come. “As blockchain usage continues to grow,” Eric says, “people will be less and less happy to wait for someone else’s transaction to finish. Over time, speed will only become more important.”
Brown CS Professor Michael Littman has just been named a Leshner Fellow focusing on Artificial Intelligence by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Each year, the AAAS selects leaders from disciplines at the forefront of important science-society issues, recognizing them for their contributions and commitment to public engagement in the field. Fellows are provided with the opportunity to convene for a week of intensive public-engagement and science-communication collaboration with the rest of the cohort, with the goal of increasing public engagement and enacting institutional change during the fellowship year. 
“I am most interested in helping people whose lives are being impacted by computing technology,” Michael explains, “to understand how that technology works and how we can best enhance its ability to empower us while minimizing its risks.” As a founding member of “AI Hub” (an organization with the goal of providing free, high-quality information about AI to the public), and co-host of the monthly podcast “Computing Up”,  Michael continues to be a pioneer in sharing the wonders of AI and computing with the public. 
AAAI-20 is the thirty-fourth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, one of the world's most prominent international conferences on the subject. Held this year in New York from February 7-12, AAAI promotes theoretical and applied AI research as well as intellectual interchange among researchers and practitioners. As with previous years, this year's AAAI included a Student Abstract Program that allows undergraduate, Master's, and PhD students to submit short, extended abstracts. Brown CS undergraduate Nishanth Kumar's abstract was one of the few chosen from numerous submissions, and it was included in the conference proceedings.
Nishanth is an Undergraduate Research Assistant in Brown CS Professor Stefanie Tellex's Humans 2 Robots Lab whose interests include robotics, artificial intelligence, and using hardware and software to create truly useful products. Primarily advised by Stefanie, his other advisors include Professor George Konidaris and Michael Littman of Brown CS.
"My work for the conference," Nishanth explains, "was about discerning relevance within large world-models. AI agents, such as intelligent robots, possess models of the world that they use to perform specific tasks. It is common practice for programmers to hand-design models to only contain relevant information. However, generally-intelligent agents must automatically discern this relevance for themselves based on the particular task they are given. My work proposes an algorithm to do this, which will hopefully help AI agents solve difficult, large-problems like Minecraft in the future."
AAAI-20 is the thirty-fourth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, one of the world's most prominent international conferences on the subject. Held this year in New York from February 7-12, AAAI promotes theoretical and applied AI research as well as intellectual interchange among researchers and practitioners. This year, the conference also included an Undergraduate Consortium (AAAI-UC), at which Brown CS undergraduates Jessica Dai and Pazia Bermudez-Silverman presented their recent research. Both were advised by Sarah M. Brown, a postdoctoral research associate at Brown's Data Science Initiative.
"My work," Jessica says, "is about how to understand and interpret the performance of 'fair' machine learning algorithms, particularly in situations where the data used for training a model is unrepresentative of the real-world domain in which it will be applied. My research finds that simply changing the demographics of datasets (e.g. to reflect real-world proportions) has unpredictable effects on 'fair' algorithms, and proposes a model for understanding 'ML bias' that encompasses historical or systemic inequity; poor data collection, sampling, or labeling; or any combination of these potential 'sources of unfairness'."  
AAAI-UC offered undergraduate students an opportunity to enrich their conference experience by (1) presenting and receiving critical feedback about their work in a professional, academic setting; (2) meeting prospective graduate advisors; (3) receiving mentoring about the advantages (and disadvantages) of pursuing graduate studies in AI as well as practical early career advice; (4) expanding their professional network to include both AI experts, current graduate students, and undergraduate peers; and (5) providing advice, tools, and resources for successfully applying to and attending graduate school in an AI-related field.
Pazia explains that her research focuses on the harm (racial, gender-based, class-based, and so on) that AI models and algorithms are causing in our society. "While these models," she says, "are used in many areas, including employment, housing, and welfare, I am focusing particularly on AI systems used in criminal justice, including predictive policing, recidivism, and facial recognition algorithms, which have all been shown to be racially biased. My work synthesizes previous analyses of this urgent topic and recommendations to make change in this area, including auditing these systems, spreading awareness, and putting pressure on those using them, as well as demonstrates how these algorithms feed each other and contribute to both a culture of poverty and structural racism." 
Their applications were reviewed according to criteria that included evidence of significant personal contributions to an AI research project, assessment of contribution to and benefit from participating in the Undergraduate Consortium, and input from their advisors. The acceptance rate for applications was only 16 percent.
Not only do we spend most of our lives indoors, says Brown CS Professor Daniel Ritchie, we spend a sizable percentage of our time virtually indoors, exploring computer-generated interiors. Some uses for these spaces are well known, like architects creating digital representations of buildings that don't yet exist, but others (moving furniture around a virtual living room before making a purchase, or training robots) are only beginning to become familiar to the layperson. 
Test yourself by looking at the images throughout this story: did a machine or a person design each room? Answers are at the bottom.
"The demand for virtual bedrooms, living rooms, offices, kitchens, and so on has never been higher," Daniel says. "Not only established fields like architecture and interior design and gaming but newer and rapidly-growing ones like robotics, virtual reality, and augmented reality – all of these need to create high-fidelity digital instances of real-world indoor scenes." 
To fully meet the demands of those industries, Ritchie explains, we need algorithms to generate data-driven scenes, producing a variety of plausible and visually appealing results that are generated quickly and user-controllable. At the moment, no existing approach satisfies all of these requirements. But his latest project presents a scene synthesis system that aims to do all these things, as well as a plan to demonstrate the system’s effectiveness by developing or improving real-world applications.
In the short term, we might soon be using Daniel's work to design our next living rooms. Slightly further down the road, we might use it to help train our household robots to navigate those same spaces.
The project has three main thrusts:
This project, which will be funded by a recently-awarded NSF Small Grant, continues work that Daniel has collaborated on with Kai Wang, his PhD student, and published together in three papers (one, two, three) at top conferences for graphics and vision like SIGGRAPH and CVPR. Kai recently received an Adobe Research Fellowship for this work.
"I'm really enthused that we'll be sharing interactive demos with the general public," Daniel says, "and it's very important to me that we're improving representation in CS. Our collaboration with Wayfair is being led by a female grad student, and last summer, I hosted a student from the University of Southern Mississippi who's also working in this area. We're still collaborating remotely. Two other female students will join my lab next semester, and I'll also be presenting our work to students in the Artemis Project, a Brown CS program for ninth-grade girls who are interested in STEM."
Answers for the three scenes above: (1) person on the left and machine on the right, (2) person on the left and machine on the right, and (3) machine on the left and person on the right.
Brown CS PhD student Kai Wang has just received an Adobe Research Fellowship for his research in automating design of structures and layouts. His work currently centers on bridging computer graphics and machine learning to create data-driven algorithms to achieve this automation. 
The Adobe Research Fellowship program was created to recognize outstanding graduate students carrying out exceptional research. This research spans a broad array of subjects, including Computer Graphics, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Programming Languages. The fellowship includes a monetary award, a chance to interview for an internship at Adobe, and an opportunity to work with an Adobe Research mentor. This year, Kai is one of ten winners of the award, joining fellow graduate students from MIT, Cornell, UC Berkeley, and other universities around the world. 
Kai’s research thus far, he explains, has focused on the problem of creating algorithms that can automatically design indoor scenes. “We spend a lot of time in indoor spaces designed to support functionalities such as sleeping, cooking, meeting, etc,” Kai says. “To create the layouts of such spaces, a lot of human expertise and labor is often needed.” Kai's algorithms use deep neural networks to learn indoor scene layout patterns from large collections of existing layouts, enabling them to create plausible new scenes without ever being explicitly told how to do so. These algorithms can rapidly generate many new scene layouts, making them useful for design inspiration or to provide novel virtual training environments for autonomous robots. Going forward, Kai is interested in extending these machine learning algorithms to other types of layout problems (floor plans, for example) and other design problems that involve making sequences of decisions.
Over the past two years, Kai’s lab –led by Brown CS Professor Daniel Ritchie– has made significant inroads into this field of automatic indoor scene layout via machine learning. “We call this the scene synthesis problem,” Daniel explains. “Given the architectural specification of a room –its walls, doors, and windows– the goal is to create a plausible instance of a particular  type of room, say a bedroom, by filling it with the right types of objects in the right arrangements. In doing so, we aim to build a system that can support a range of use cases.” Coming off the heels of a recent grant award, the researchers in Daniel’s lab continue to be recognized for their groundbreaking work. 
The Computing Research Association (CRA) is a coalition of more than 200 organizations with the mission of enhancing innovation by joining with industry, government, and academia to strengthen research and advance education in computing. Every year, they recognize North American students who show phenomenal research potential with their Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Award, and in 2020, Brown CS made one of the strongest showings in the Honorable Mentions category. Out of 103 students who received Honorable Mentions, four of them are Brown CS students: Deniz Bayazit, Rigel Galgana, Nishanth Kumar, and Esteban Safranchik. Last year, Brown CS students received three Honorable Mentions.
Asked to desribe her work, Deniz says that it lies in the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and robotics. "Humans," she says, "can convey instructions to other humans via different means of communication. They have the ability to enter a new environment and follow through a navigation task when given a partial or full map, and hinted with a form of natural language (NL). Reproducing a similar ability in a robot would be extremely useful for untrained users, who do not have an in-depth knowledge of robot programming. To achieve grounding language to arbitrary landmarks in any outdoor environment (or in other words, without needing to re-train the language model for a new environment), I worked with Matthew Berg, Rebecca Mathew, Ariel Rotter-Aboyoun, Professor Pavlick, and Professor Tellex in summer, 2019. We are currently investigating spatial language understanding models that could help guide agents in partially observable environments with natural language hints such as 'The car is behind the CIT on Waterman Street.'"
"Let's play a game," says Rigel when posed with questions about his research. "Say that you are in dire need of TA assistance on a project, so you decide to register for every single TA hours slot for the next month in hopes of getting seen at least once. While you would ideally want a high spot on SignMeUp so as to avoid a long wait, the queue is shuffled randomly at the beginning of each set of hours. After this shuffling, you see how long you'll have to wait before getting seen and decide whether or not to wait it out or delete your ticket. Assuming you knew in advance how crowded each session was ahead of time, how do you decide when to wait it out? How long do you expect to wait? What if you wanted to get seen at least twice? Thrice? This variant of the secretary problem is only one of many applications of order statistics. Other applications include auction design and analysis, Bayesian-optimal pricing, and more. For the last year and a half, I've been working with Professor Amy Greenwald on efficient algorithms to compute joint distributions of order statistics with the goal of answering some of the above questions."
Nishanth's research has focused on two interrelated components of AI for Robotics: intelligence and collaboration. "On the collaboration front," he says, "I've worked on using Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR) to allow humans to effectively and intuitively give robots all the information required to accomplish complex tasks. On the intelligence front, I've helped make state-of-the-art Learning from Demonstration (LfD) algorithms more data-efficient. I've also worked on bridging the fields of Reinforcement Learning and Formal Methods to allow agents to reason about which parts of the world are relevant to their decision making, and thus ignore irrelevant factors."
"I'm incredibly lucky and grateful," says Nishanth, "to be part of such an amazing community within Brown CS: none of my work would be possible without it. Specifically, I want to thank my amazing mentors and collaborators in the H2R, IRL, and RLAB groups, especially Professors Stefanie Tellex, George Konidaris, and Michael Littman. I also want to thank TStaff and CIS for never failing to support the unique needs that come with running experiments on robots. I couldn't imagine a better environment in which to produce great research!"
"My primary area of research," Esteban tells us, "is weakly supervised machine learning, a paradigm for machine learning featuring noisy or limited information sources as substitutes to full supervision. My work with Prof. Stephen Bach addresses the challenges of building classifiers and structured predictors for NLP in the absence of hand-labeled data. During the summer, I worked on WISER, a framework for training deep sequence taggers with weak supervision from user-written rules. Our work introduces a novel approach to modeling weak supervision sources that achieves state-of-the-art performance on several NLP tasks. WISER allows users to build powerful machine learning systems without relying on ground-truth labeled data."

Over the past few years, The Brown Daily Herald has published several articles and op-eds about growing enrollment in computer science, including suggestions on how to address the resulting challenges that students face. This morning, Professor and Chair Ugur Çetintemel and Professor Shriram Krishnamurthi continued the dialogue with an op-ed explaining the constraints that Brown CS faces as it tries to balance the tradeoffs between access and an intimate feel.

Please note that unfortunately, the SIRoS conference planned for March 20 will be postponed to a later date. If you have any questions, please contact hcri@brown.edu.
SIRoS (Societal Implications of Robotics Symposium) 3: Robots Entering Society will be held on March 20, 2020. The article below looks back at SIRoS 1 and 2 in anticipation of a symposium that will bring together scholars and practitioners from multiple disciplines to examine the difficult questions: What are our obligations to shape the transformative impact of robotics on our society to be positive? How can we contribute to such a positive shaping? And what legal and ethical norms may have to be established to foster a harmonious growth toward a future society with robots?
“SIRoS 1 was when the question really struck me,” remembers HCRI Co-Director, Professor Michael Littman of Brown CS. “How do we keep the value of humans, of people, from declining? We’ve known for a long time that we’re at an inflection point, and the first SIRoS really drove the point home for me.” He’s talking about the Societal Implications of Robotics Symposium, first held by Brown’s Humanity-Centered Robotics Initiative (HCRI) in 2015. Every two years, the conference has been bringing together scholars and practitioners from multiple disciplines to examine the difficult questions of a future society where robots are part of everyday life. SIRoS 3 is scheduled for 2019.
“For so long,” explains HCRI Associate Director Peter Haas, “Robotics had always been a research endeavor, with ethics and other issues as more of an afterthought, but SIRoS 1 saw people who are making a big difference in the field talking to each other and considering ethical implications for the first time.”
The ideas that Michael references above are highlighted in a keynote address (“Robotics, Empowerment, and Equity”) delivered at SIRoS 1 by Illah Nourbakhsh of the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. Littman explains that it included an early mention of a concept that’s been repeatedly making news in 2017: guaranteed basic income. “This was an extremely important realization," Michael says. "Because of robots, the work that had been done by people is being done by infrastructure. Some politicians rail against immigrants, but you could argue that computer scientists are causing the problem: the value of people is going down. This is exactly the kind of idea that arises when the research community broadens its outlook to include societal issues."
A second keynote (“How the Law Will Think About Robots (And Why You Should Care)”) by Bill Smart of Oregon State University, a Brown CS PhD alum, bookended three panel discussions with small groups of leading robotics researchers, economists, philosophers, psychologists, legal scholars, and even representatives of funding agencies. “It was really exciting to see the field changing,” says Peter. “SIRoS 1 helped us understand that robotics isn’t just research: it’s becoming applied research, with sociological issues rising to the forefront.”

SIRos 2: Seeing Through Their Eyes
A small, padded cube is flying toward you from across the auditorium. There’s a microphone inside: you catch it, use the voice amplification to share your thoughts with the group, and then throw it to someone else. It’s a good illustration of a key difference between SIRoS 1 and 2. Like its predecessor, the second conference dealt with the difficult questions of how to ensure that robotics has positive effects on society, with talks on healthcare robot policy, algorithmic bias, the legality of autonomous weapons systems, and more, but the approach was a bit less traditional.
“We had more panel discussions,” says Michael, “but we really focused on having people make shorter position statements so we could allow the audience to push back. It helped create a shared perspective, and it felt outside the norm of academic meetings — much more playful. Increasing the size and diversity of our audience let us see problems and challenges through their eyes. It was extremely satisfying to bring this community together.”
As with SIRoS 1, the topics discussed have only increased in relevance in the days since. As just one example, the juxtaposition of the ethical dilemma known as the Trolley Problem with the rise of self-driving cars, first proposed by SIRoS 2 speaker Gary Marcus in 2012, has entered the public consciousness sufficiently that it spawned a popular Internet meme and eventually entire web sites devoted to collecting variants of that meme. And research is already underway, including some by HCRI Co-Director, Professor Bertram Malle of Brown’s Department of Cognitive, Linguistic, and Psychological Sciences (CLIPS).

“Problems like this have been discussed in academic circles before,” says Peter, “but it was wonderful to see strategies and possible answers presented. People see the future coming, and they’re thinking about when robots will be prolific, and they’re proposing solutions.”
“This year's SIROS 2 also served as a preconference to the We Robot conference, which has discussed legal and policy questions concerning robots for five years now,” adds Bertram. “This is an important partnership we hope to build on. Thoughtful science should inspire thoughtful law and policy initiatives.”

SIRoS 3: Showing Leadership
“One of the important things we have to do for SIRoS 3 is make sure that we have enough seating,” laughs Peter. “The quality of our speakers has really been fantastic, and we’re looking to continue finding the best ideas from around the world. We’re planning for growth.”
And the growth of the conference mirrors the expansion of the Humanity-Centered Robotics Initiative as a whole. It’s continuing to facilitate collaboration among Brown researchers by providing access to robots, robotic research, and building spaces, and Peter explains that HCRI has recently formed corporate partnerships with Hasbro and Sproutel, along with external funding to support them. The goal is to serve as an interface with Brown Robotics for the two companies, to help them understand our evolving robotic future from HCRI’s unique perspective.
“Robotics is at an inflection point,” he says, “like computing was in the 1970s. It’s not just the purview of a select few any longer, so we have to keep looking toward the future in the broadest sense. It’s a real opportunity for Brown to show leadership: interdisciplinary work is what we do well, and HCRI and SIRos are great examples.”
Michael agrees: “All the pieces are in place for robots to have a dramatic effect on individuals, but we don’t have a crisp structure yet. SIRoS is about aiming the rocket before it goes off the launch pad. It might sound playful, but it’s deadly serious to me. Robotics needs more roboticists, but just as much, it needs more sociologists. Right now is when we need the interdisciplinary approach.”
"There seems to be some kind of magic," says Professor Ellie Pavlick of Brown CS, "that happens in humans' heads that allows us to conjure up a staggering amount of information in order to make inferences: not just information about language, but assumption and intents. The main questions I'm interested in in this area are about representation and learning. What is 'common sense' and what does it 'look like'? How do humans represent our knowledge about the world, and how do we build representations through the experience of living rather than supervised training? And how can we make the answers to these questions play well within a computational system?"
Two upcoming projects will allow Ellie and her collaborators to explore those answers in depth. They're being funded by two grants, one from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and one from the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA). The latter of these, at six million dollars, is the largest Brown CS grant to date. 
One of Ellie's partners, Professor Carsten Eickhoff of Brown CS, who leads the AI Lab at Brown's Center for Biomedical Informatics, explains that he looks at both grants from an Information Retrieval perspective. "Information Retrieval engineers and researchers," he says, "have spent decades devising formal models describing the connection between search queries and the best possible results to answer them. In particular, we care about the true underlying intention behind the ill-formed strings of keywords that all of us hammer into Google and Co. on a daily basis. For many queries this interpretation will be straightforward; for a significant number of others, however, it becomes veritable detective work. While modern natural language processing techniques have become indispensable in this pursuit of meaning, intentions, and goals, there still is a gap between the way in which people and machines read and generate language. These projects try to close this gap and truly enable search engines to understand what you are looking for."
Better Extraction from Text Toward Enhanced Retrieval
In the IARPA grant project ("Better Extraction from Text Towards Enhanced Retrieval"), the researchers will be studying methods for improving search that work across languages and which account for fine-grained differences in users' interests.
"Probably the most familiar of all natural language processing applications," Ellie says, "is information retrieval. We can think of Google search: products like it seem to perform extremely well, but they're actually only good at answering queries that a huge number of people have already asked. It seems surprising, but when you search for 'what was that movie with the box of chocolates', you're probably one of thousands of people who have searched for the same thing."
However, when people need to do very specific searches over very specialized sets of documents, search quality is far worse: think of the daily frustration from trying to find something in a massive pile of old email. In this project, Ellie and her team will attempt to build better search methods that quickly recognize a fine-grained topic by asking a small number of disambiguating questions and reorganizing the entire representation of language on the basis of the answers. The goal is for users to get better results from searches on very specialized topics, such as finding evidence for and against a little-known scientific theory. Collaborators include Carsten as well as colleagues from Ohio State University and University of Pennsylvania.
Grounded Artificial Intelligence Language Acquisition
To situate the project ("Grounded Artificial Intelligence Language Acquisition") funded by the second grant, Ellie explains that current approaches for teaching language to computers work by reading large volumes of text over and over.
"This means that they can produce normal-sounding sentences," she says, "but have zero knowledge of what they actually mean. Instead, we'll be teaching computers the meaning of words by emulating the way we talk to toddlers. They learn language by interacting with the world and humans, hearing something like this: 'Let's get ready for lunch. We should get a plate and glass to put on the table so we can eat.' We'll be doing that in virtual reality, letting you talk to a computer just like you would with a child." 
Over time, the computer will learn to connect the words the person says to the objects and actions it observes. Later, it will generate the same words when it sees similar objects and actions.
"Asking questions and dialog is essential to robotics and language grounding," says Professor Stefanie Tellex of Brown CS, one of Ellie's collaborators. "Moreover, as a robot gains long-term memory, the information retrieval questions and applications for this grant are important, too. Think about asking a robot in your home when Grandma last took her medicine, or where she left her keys."
"We have an amazingly multidisciplinary group of collaborators right here at Brown," says Ellie, "including Carsten Eickhoff in Natural Language Processing, Roman Feiman in Developmental Psychology, Stefanie Tellex in Robotics, and Daniel Ritchie in Graphics. It's a dream team."
"Computer scientists," says Roman, "are trying to engineer systems that understand and use language. Cognitive scientists are trying to reverse-engineer how humans do the same thing. The two fields can learn a lot from each other, because engineering solutions can inspire scientific hypotheses and scientific findings can be the basis for new approaches in engineering. What I think is really special about our group is that we all have deep interests in the other's field, so that we can make meaningful connections from our own areas of expertise. That's rare, and it's an outstanding opportunity to make progress together."
Among other things, Brown CS history is a treasure trove of stories, and sometimes even the sequence of events that led to a recent symposium is a tale worth telling.
As last year began, Marc Weber ‘84 had hypertext on the brain. The Computer History Museum (CHM) was planning a conference on pioneering inventor Douglas Engelbart, and in Marc’s role as the Curatorial Director of CHM’s Internet History Program, he knew about an effort by two alums to revive Brown’s late 1960s hypertext system, FRESS.
Steven DeRose ‘81 AM ‘86 PhD ‘89 had been the final director of the FRESS project, building its last binary from 82,000 lines of assembly source. David Durand ‘83 had been a FRESS user in high school due to a policy that gave access to the children of faculty members. In 1989, they created a FRESS demo for the ACM Hypertext Conference after building an emulator for its original vector graphics display.
Marc asked Professor Andries “Andy” van Dam to revive the FRESS demo for CHM’s conference, but the emulator no longer worked, so Tyler Schicke ‘18 ScM ‘19 was pressed into service, working with David to create a new one. That’s where Norm Meyrowitz ‘81 enters our story.
“Andy, in his classic ‘the more the merrier’ style,” Norm remembers, “thought I should try to revive Intermedia, Brown’s hypertext system from the late 1980s. We thought it had been lost due to a degraded disk, but someone had saved our demo copy.” And so he started buying up 30-year-old hardware: mice, displays, video cards, cables.
“And it worked!” he says. “It got me thinking two things. The first was that we should find more of our old systems and create a symposium to celebrate Brown’s impact on the online universe, and the second was that I was about to create a lot of work for myself.”   
A symposium was born, and on May 23, Brown CS held A Half-Century of Hypertext to recognize Brown’s many contributions to the linked world. The event featured a half-dozen demos and almost thirty presenters, ranging in age from their early twenties to late eighties.
In the article here, our largest feature to date, we retrace the symposium’s chronology to provide a brief history of five decades of research with a lasting impact.
“I’ve never really been interested in technology just for technology’s sake,” explains Brown CS alum Michael Frederickson ‘08, “but rather in using technology to make somebody feel something.” Currently working as a Lead Technical Director at Pixar Animation Studios, Michael has indeed dedicated his life to this passion, and he has made an impact on the lives of so many Brown CS students who look to follow this dream.
Michael’s love of the “emotion of awe”, as he calls it, began very early on. “I remember watching Jurassic Park,” he laughs, “and my nine-year-old brain was just completely amazed. The graphics were so awe-inspiring and I knew I wanted to help do that.” This intellectual curiosity and passion naturally led Michael to Brown, where he immediately immersed himself in the computer science department. “There’s always been a conflict for me between the artistic side and the technical side,” he explains, “because technical involves abstraction, and sometimes as an artist you need to forget the structure and explore without following a specific path. I was attracted to Brown as a place where both these modes of exploration and discovery were encouraged, and often blended.” And it was at Brown that Michael really thrived. 
“I remember back in 2003, we had this small capped animation class,” laughs Brown CS Professor Barb Meier, “and Michael showed up to class with three books, and just sat in the center front row of the class as a first-year student. He always had a really good impact on the class, he could work with anybody, had tons of new ideas.” These ideas, this desire to make people feel emotions through art, was what eventually drew Michael to work at Pixar. “Brown and Pixar are both really compatible with who I am. Pixar has always been a place that understands there is deep creativity in technology – that at the deepest levels of technical or artistic sophistication, there isn't much difference between an ‘artist’ and a ‘scientist’.”
But what really makes Michael special is how much he’s given back to the Brown community, even a decade after graduating from the program. Ranging from holding “office-hours” in which he personally guides students on their CS projects, to organizing recruitment trips for Pixar, to giving constructive critiques in Barb’s computer animation class, he has remained personally vested in the lives of so many Brown CS students, and his advice has proven to be invaluable.
What motivates Michael to come back even now? “I suppose some combination of empathy and passion,” he answers. “There’s something about this place that just feels right to me.” As he reminisces about his years as an undergraduate, Michael distinctly remembers the excitement he felt as he ventured into the world of CS. “I remember when Pixar came to recruit when I was a freshman and I just freaked out,” he laughs. “I remember how unthinkably off the map excited I was to get the opportunity to ask questions about that. I remember how good that felt, and I want someone else to get to feel that good. I really just love doing this stuff, and I'm always excited to help out when I see a student with an echo of the passion that got me into graphics in the first place.” 
This desire to help others has always been there for Michael (he was a TA for Barb’s computer animation class for six semesters), and he explains this desire as akin to a movie. “Telling somebody the conclusion has very little impact,” he explains, “but watching a movie puts you through this choreography of emotions over time. I always loved the challenge of teaching as a TA – trying to come up with the right way to explain or the right experience to put different students through to help them come to their own understanding of filmmaking is a really satisfying challenge.” 
Given that Michael has had such a fulfilling and impactful career, what advice would he have for current students who look to follow in his footsteps? “If you’re fortunate enough to have the chance,” he says, “think very hard about what you find yourself wanting to do when no one is watching. Brown is an environment full of intrinsically motivated people. The open curriculum lets you run all these little experiments. ‘Do I like this subject? Am I happy in big groups? Alone? Do I like structure? Improvisation?’ You can use Brown as a little lab to notice what you really love and just can’t stop yourself from doing.” It’s clear that Michael has certainly found his passion, and will undoubtedly help generations of Brown CS students do the same. 
Hoping to encourage young authors to tackle emerging business themes, the Financial Times and McKinsey and Company first awarded the Bracken Bower Prize in 2014. The award is given to the best business book proposal by an author younger than 35, and it's already helped a number of young business writers bring their ideas from proposal to publication.
This year, Ernesto Zaldivar, a graduate of Brown University's Executive Master in Cybersecurity (EMCS) program, was one of three finalists for the award with his proposal for a book titled InfoSec. "InfoSec is based on the field research I completed for my EMCS Critical Challenge Project. The unique research opportunities I had were possible because of my EMCS cohort, Brown faculty, concurrent EMCS cohorts, and Brown alums. Their thoughtful introductions to leading cybersecurity practitioners were instrumental and granted me unprecedented access to high-profile information security teams," said Zaldivar.
In addition to citing the importance of the support he received from his classmates and professors, he added: "The Executive Master in Cybersecurity curriculum made me a better cybersecurity professional and scholar by providing me with an interdisciplinary knowledge base and scientific frameworks that I can apply to solving novel cybersecurity problems."  
A panel of expert judges, looking for work that provides a compelling and enjoyable insight into future trends in business, economics, finance, or management, selected Ernesto's entry as one of the top three from a pool of over 80 proposals from 22 countries. Jonathan Hillman, the winner of the prize, is also a Brown alum.
You can read an excerpt from Zaldivar's proposal here.
"Two weeks before the OOPSLA 2009 deadline," remembers Brown CS alum Arjun Guha (now Associate Professor of Computer Science at University of Massachusetts, Amherst), "Shriram declared that it was time to actually write a Flapjax paper. That isn't much time, but since we had so much experience, the system was so polished, and because I had decided to drop a class to focus on writing, it actually came together easily."
Co-written with Brown CS alums Leo A. Meyerovich (now at Graphistry), Jacob Baskin (now at Coord), Gregory H. Cooper (now at Google), Michael Greenberg (now at Pomona College), and Aleksandra N. Culver (now at Google) and Brown CS Professor Shriram Krishnamurthi, that paper ("Flapjax: A Programming Language for Ajax Applications"), which presented a new language designed for contemporary web applications, has won the OOPSLA Most Influential Paper Award.
First released in 2006, Flapjax added now-ubiquitous reactive abstractions to Web programming. Specifically, it borrowed from functional reactive programming to (1) provide event streams, a uniform abstraction for communication within a program as well as with external Web services, and (2) automatically track dependencies and propagating updates along those dataflows. This allows developers to write reactive interfaces in a declarative and compositional style. Built on top of JavaScript, Flapjax runs on unmodified browsers and readily interoperates with existing JavaScript code, usable as either a programming language (that is compiled to JavaScript) or as a JavaScript library.
As Arjun noted in his acceptance speech, a paper about Flapjax didn't come until three years later. During those three years, the language was part of multiple research projects: undergraduate honors theses for Jacob, Leo, and Michael; a PhD thesis from Gregory; and two papers by Arjun.
"The lesson that I took away from it as a junior graduate student," Arjun said of the Flapjax project, "was that it is worthwhile and rewarding to take the time to build systems that work, and that the approach leads to better and more research."
The International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) is believed to be oldest, largest, and perhaps the most prestigious programming competition in the world. An algorithmic programming contest for college students, it requires teams of three to solve real-world problems, fostering collaboration, creativity, innovation, and the ability to perform under pressure. 
Last month, a team from Brown CS (undergraduate students Khemarat Boonyapaluk, Rutchathon Chairattana-Apirom, and Shreeyash Gotmare, coached by Professor Rodrigo Fonseca) returned from the ICPC's 2019 Northeast North America Regional Contest with a Third Place award. Their competitors were drawn from states and provinces that included Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland, Labrador, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New York, with the exception of New York City.
After working with a five-hour deadline to solve the greatest number of problems in the fewest attempts in the least cumulative time, the Brown team was awarded the opportunity to advance to the ICPC North American Championship, which will be held in Atlanta, Georgia, in February, 2020. Winners of that event will continue onward to the World Finals in Moscow, Russia. In last year’s regionals, 49,935 contestants from 3,098 universities in 111 countries on six continents competed at over 530 sites to advance to the World Finals.
Last week, Professor Seny Kamara of Brown CS testified at a Congressional hearing ("Banking on Your Data: The Role of Big Data in Financial Services"), explaining that cryptography solutions to improve consumer financial health can be implemented without endangering privacy. Invited by the U.S. House Financial Services Committee Task Force on Financial Technology, Seny was part of a panel of data security and cryptography experts. 
At various times, Seny notes, the discussion expanded to a larger examination of equity and bias, reminding him of topics addressed in Brown's Socially Responsible Computing program and his own course (CS 2950-V Topics in Applied Cryptography: Crypto for Social Good), which examines how surveillance is used to suppress dissent and how cryptography can be used to protect marginalized groups. One example was when Representative Rashida Tlaib asked about the use of biometrics in low-income Detroit communities, and how it affects immigrants and people of color.
The rise of big data, Seny explained, has created a host of new financial products, but many of them pose serious privacy concerns because of the data they collect. For example, cash advance apps and micro-credit apps collect and use a variety of sensitive data including location data, text messages, Facebook friends and financial transactions. But since some of these apps are more often used by lower-income communities, they will be disproportionately affected by the loss of privacy.  "Cryptography researchers in academia and in industry labs," he said, "have developed a wide array of cryptographic techniques to process encrypted data." By leveraging those advances, he noted, they could improve the financial health of customers without sacrificing their privacy.
"I find it very significant," Seny tells us, "that I wasn't just sharing algorithms or code or commenting purely on technical issues but thinking seriously about the effects of technology. For our students, as future computer scientists, it's a real illustration of evaluating the impact that our work has on society. Even the act of testifying can be part of practicing responsible computer science."

“Energy efficiency is now a critically important design constraint for most computing systems today,” says Professor R. Iris Bahar of Brown CS, “and as applications become more and more memory- and compute-intensive, energy-efficiency and reliability become harder to manage.”
In a recent keynote address (“Energy-efficient and Sustainable Computing Across the Hardware/Software Stack”) at the International Green and Sustainable Computing Conference, Iris presented techniques across the Hardware/Software stack for energy-efficient and reliable computing, and discussed how these techniques may be used to achieve more sustainable computing in the future. 
“In the 1990’s,” Iris explains, “computer architects and chip designers invested huge amounts of resources to improve processor performance by supporting aggressive speculation with superscalar out-of-order execution. Eventually, power issues caught up with designers and we had to rethink designs that were more power-aware.”
With machine learning (and learning through deep neural networks) exploding in popularity, Iris’ research has been exploring the costs of deep learning and energy-efficient neural network design. “Deep neural networks have been shown to be very accurate for many applications, but in the end there are costs of deep learning that haven’t been fully accounted for (in terms of training, data set requirements, energy usage, and others),” she states, “and we may need to think twice if deep learning is the best use of our resources. Otherwise, we may hit a wall again, just like we did in the 1990’s with processor design.”
“My big vision is making design accessible to everyone,” explains co-founder/CEO of Figma, Dylan Fields, “and I want the tools to be simple and powerful.” This dream is quickly becoming a reality, as both Dylan and Brown CS alum Evan Wallace ‘12 have been recognized by INC Magazine as “Rising Stars of 2019” for founding Figma. (Dylan was also a Brown CS student.) This award aims to highlight the most impactful and world-changing startups around the world, and Figma certainly fits the bill with its innovative approach to collaborative design. The San-Francisco based startup is for those who create diagrams, illustrations, and web-based applications, and gives users the ability to work on designs together in real-time.
What sparked the idea for the company? “Well, it all started in elementary school,” laughs Dylan. “I’ve always been really excited about coding and computers, and the first time I got to do any programming in elementary school was when I had access to a basic compiler.” The creative spark certainly began early, as Dylan was designing PHP applications and even making websites for his school, and carried over to Dylan’s time at Brown. And it was at Brown that he met Evan and began exploring his entrepreneurial side. 
“Evan and I had completed several internships at major tech companies,” explains Dylan, “and we were really getting frustrated with the lack of tools available for actual design.” Growing up with Google Docs, the pair had grown accustomed to the suite of cloud-based collaborative tools that allowed multiple users to work together in real-time, and were shocked that there was no such viable tool available for web-based design. 
“Evan was doing work as a graphics TA,” Dylan remembers, “and it was so surprising that our current tools didn’t work in cloud-enabled ways. We wanted to make tools for designers that was more interactive.” Ultimately the pair ended up choosing to focus on interface design, because they saw the big trend of design becoming more important than ever. “Ten years ago at IBM, there were 72 engineers to one designer, five years ago it became eight engineers to one designer, on mobile it’s now three engineers to one designer,” explains Dylan, “and because of that, a lot of different companies started realizing that they needed to catch up and that design was becoming more important.”
The company launched in 2012, and immediately experienced explosive growth. The company now has over one million sign-ups, over 118 employees, and a customer base including Microsoft, Dropbox, Uber, Twitter, and Slack. Over the past seven years, the company has raised over $85 million in venture capital funding, and is valued at over $400 million today. “We’ve made it possible for everyone to work in one place, for designers to work with designers, marketing managers, and others, so that more people are able to access the design process,” explains Dylan.
With such an exhilarating journey into startup success, what advice does Dylan have for those students who want to follow in his shoes? “Internships are the single greatest time to explore,” he says, “and there’s no other time in your life where you have the opportunity to figure out exactly what kind of management style and cultures you like. Take on as many projects as you can, go through the process of making and supporting your own ideas – the more launches you have under your belt, the more you’re able to do the next one better.” This approach has certainly worked for Dylan and his team, and his company has made the dream of truly making design accessible a reality.

Brown CS PhD student Jiwon Choe has just won the Best Student Presentation Award for her presentation “Attacking Memory-Hard Scrypt with Near-Data-Processing” (co-authored with Brown CS Professors Maurice Herlihy and R. Iris Bahar and Boston University Professor Tali Moreshet) at the International Symposium on Memory Systems (MEMSYS ‘19). Held recently in Washington, DC, MEMSYS is an annual conference that aims to bring together leading researchers and practitioners interested in emerging memory technologies.
“In a traditional DRAM-based main memory architecture,” the authors explain, “a memory access operation requires much more time and energy than a simple logic operation. This fact is exploited to build time-consuming and power-hungry cryptographic functions that serve the purpose of deterring brute-force security attacks.” Jiwon’s presentation focuses on the impact of near-data processing (NDP) on scrypt, a widely used memory-hard password-based key-derivation function, and discusses the opportunities to undermine scrypt using compute-capable memory.
The IEEE VIS Conference is an annual conference held by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and is regarded as the foremost gathering of researchers focused on scientific visualization, information visualization, and visual analytics. This year, the conference’s Visualization Academy Selection Committee has announced that Professor David Laidlaw of  Brown CS has been named to the IEEE Visualization Academy, a group of research leaders in the field of visualization that is credited with underscoring the accomplishments of the entire field. The academy was established in 2018 by the IEEE Executive Committee with an inaugural class of 32 individuals, and induction is considered to be one of the highest honors in the field of visualization.
“I’m flattered and honored to be inducted into the IEEE Visualization Academy,” David says, “and when I look at the group being inducted in this initial year, I feel very fortunate.” With this honor coming on the heels of the 2018 Best Poster Award at IEEE Vis, David continues to have an outsized impact on the exciting field of visualization.
"Mechanism design," says Professor Amy Greenwald of Brown CS, "is the engineering branch of game theory, where knobs can be adjusted to achieve certain goals in multi-agent systems inhabited by strategic agents. For example, a network designer might seek a design that minimizes congestion assuming selfish agents."
In a recent Research Keynote Series address ("Learning Equilibria in Simulation-Based Games ... and the Ensuing Empirical Design of Mechanisms") at the annual IEEE UEMCON (the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Ubiquitous Computing, Electronics and Mobile Communication Conference), she put forth a methodology to design these mechanisms. It applies under two key conditions:
"Under these conditions," Amy says, "we use the probably approximately correct learning framework to construct algorithms that learn equilibria.  We show experimentally that our methodology can be used to design effective mechanisms that capture stylized, but rich multiagent systems, such as advertisement exchanges, which are not generally amenable to analytical mechanism design."
Amy's research on focuses game-theoretic and economic interactions among computational agents, applied to areas like autonomous bidding in wireless spectrum auctions and ad exchanges. During the 2018-19 academic year, she was a visiting researcher at the Artificial Intelligence Research Center at the Japanese National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Tokyo, and in 2017, she gave a keynote address at Microsoft's Faculty Summit.
"I had the misfortune of having early success," says Professor Shriram Krishnamurthi of Brown CS. In a recent invited talk ("On the Expressive Power of Programming Languages") at Papers We Love Conference 2019, he shares some personal history with the audience, saying that academic achievement at the start of his career brought with it a profound experience of impostor syndrome.
During that identity crisis, he read a paper of the same title by Matthias Felleisen. "It was the most stunning paper I had ever read," Shriram says, "and remains so. It's like the poem that never leaves your soul." Explaining that his listeners will benefit from "cultural knowledge" of programming language theory, Shriram lifts them above the fray of linguistic claims and language wars to show how a fellow scientist's devotion to a clean approach, correspondence of formalism and intuition, and tautness of execution can be personally revelatory.  
"I hope to peel off some of those layers," he says, "and help you, too, understand the paper – hopefully while preserving the joy and beauty I experienced."
A recording of the talk is available here.
Shriram's other recent invited talks include a plenary talk at FCRC 2019 (recording here) and keynotes at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne's Teaching Computational Thinking Workshop (recording here) and Programming 2018.
Brown CS is happy to announce that Stefanie Tellex has been promoted to Associate Professor with Tenure, effective as of July 1, 2019. "This achievement," she says, "could not have happened without my amazing students and collaborators. I'm privileged to work with some of the best people in the world, and my research success would not be possible without them. I have truly found an academic home in the Brown CS Department, and I greatly appreciate finding such a supportive, inclusive, and friendly
environment."
Stefanie came to Brown in 2013 after working as a research scientist at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). She was also a postdoctoral research associate at MIT, serving as the technical lead for the Interpretation of Spatial Language Project, which worked to develop a language understanding system for robotic mobile manipulators.
Stefanie's Humans 2 Robots Laboratory aims to create robots that collaborate with people to meet their needs, so that human-robot collaboration approaches the ease of human-human collaboration. They apply probabilistic methods, corpus-based training, and decision theory to develop interactive robotic systems that can understand and generate natural language. Their focus is on three key challenges: 1) perceiving the world using the robot’s sensors, 2) communicating with people to understand their needs and how to meet them, and 3) acting to change the world in ways that meet people’s needs.
In addition to her many honors (they include an NSF CAREER Award, Sloan Fellowship, DARPA Director's Fellowship, and a DARPA Young Faculty Award), Stefanie has served as an advisor for a children's book about robots and contributed to an exhibit at London's Science Museum. Most recently, she received a Seed Award from Brown's Office of the Vice President for Research and Brown's Early Career Research Achievement Award.
“I had a choice to take a high-paying job in Silicon Valley,” laughs Brown CS alum Victoria Chávez ‘18, “but I chose to follow my passions and make a difference.” Making a difference seems to be the hallmark of so many Brown students, and Victoria is no different. Currently working as part-time faculty for the University of Rhode Island computer science department and serving as a consultant for the Computer Science for Rhode Island (CS4RI) education initiative, she’s devoted her career to helping others, and her impacts can be felt far beyond beyond campus.
Victoria discovered her love for computer science very early on. “I took computer science in high school,” she remembers, “and I fell in love.” This love for problem solving and tinkering, combined with her passion for making an impact, naturally led her to Brown. But at Brown, she decided to take a bit of an unconventional path. “I was super involved as a TA,” she explains, “and I wanted to help students from a similar background to mine.” Growing up in a single-parent household in the West Side of Chicago, Victoria knew the struggles and challenges often faced by those from disadvantaged backgrounds, and wanted to help those students. 
“Low-income students end up having much less preparation for college, and are much more likely to leave STEM fields,” describes Victoria. So with this realization in mind, Victoria chose to follow a path that diverged from the typical high-paying Bay Area development job that so many CS students decide to pursue. “I couldn’t find a Master of Arts in teaching computer science,” she laughs, “so I went for a Master’s in Urban Education Policy.” Now armed with a background in both STEM and Urban Policy, Victoria took on a role as a researcher with CS4RI. CS4RI is one of the most comprehensive computer science initiatives in the country, with the main goal of ensuring that CS opportunities and access are available to all Rhode Island students in the years ahead. Specializing in providing access to students with learning disabilities, Victoria immersed herself in the program.
It was during her time at the program that one of her colleagues brought up a suggestion. There was an open teaching position in the URI computer science department, and Victoria seemed like the perfect fit. Naturally, she jumped at the opportunity to get involved in a grass-roots movement to improve computer science access. 
Why has she chosen this route? “I don’t want to spend my life debugging code,” laughs Victoria. “I like big-picture solutions. I don’t really care about producing products for a corporation, I would much rather work on making education more equitable, on helping low-income students succeed.” Victoria has brought this philosophy to URI, where she currently teaches Web Design and Programming, a course for students with all levels of programming experience. “I want to create an environment where everyone can prosper,” she remarks, “an environment where I can really get to know my students and there’s an emphasis on learning and not just grades.” 
When asked what prepared her the most for her eventual career, Victoria has an immediate answer: the UTA program. “I felt like working as a TA really prepared me for the work,” she explains. “It shaped my view of computer science and helped me understand what I believe to be true about computer science education.” As an HTA for an introductory CS class, one of the developers of CS 17’s workshops, and a founding member of Mosaic+ –a program to increase the participation and retention of CS students of underrepresented backgrounds– Victoria has clearly made the most of her time at Brown to make an impact on the Rhode Island community.
The Theory of Cryptography Conference (TCC) is an International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR) conference that focuses on paradigms, approaches, and techniques used to conceptualize, define, and provide solutions to natural cryptographic problems and computer security concerns. With a single author paper from 2008 ("Incrementally Verifiable Computation or Proofs of Knowledge Imply Time/Space Efficiency"), Professor Paul Valiant of Brown CS has just won the conference's fifth Test of Time Award, which recognizes outstanding papers that have made a significant contribution to the theory of cryptography, preferably with influence also in other areas of cryptography, computer science theory, and beyond. He joins a distinguished list of previous winners that includes Dan Boneh, Cynthia Dwork, and Silvio Micali.
Paul's paper asks the question: can long computations be easily adapted to produce a certificate of their correctness? While each individual step of a trillion-step computation can be easily certified, no one would read through a trillion certificates. In response, in an analogy to cryptographic "hash functions" that transform any long file into a 256-bit digest, Paul shows how to compress long proofs into short yet robust certificates. The key insight, Paul says, is that while regular proofs lose their security when compressed, this is not true for a variant called "proofs of knowledge". Paul's ideas have found crucial use in recent cryptocurrency developments, under the name "zk-SNARKs", where a "SNARK", named in honor of a mythical beast in a Lewis Carroll poem, stands for "Succinct Non-interactive ARgument of Knowledge". The Test of Time Award, to be presented in December in Nuremberg, Germany, cites Paul's paper "for demonstrating the power of recursive composition of proofs of knowledge and enabling the development of efficiently verifiable proofs of correctness for complex computations".

Brown CS is glad to announce that applications are open for the Randy F. Pausch '82 Computer Science Undergraduate Summer Research Award, which provides $10,000 annually to support an undergraduate engaged in an intensive faculty-student summer research partnership with the Department of Computer Science.
The award is available thanks to a generous gift from Brown CS alum Peter Norvig, now a Director of Research at Google and a thought leader in the areas of artificial intelligence, natural language processing, information retrieval, and software engineering, was drawn to Brown as an undergraduate by the open curriculum and his interests in computer science and linguistics, which he studied in high school. His gift honors the life and work of Randy F. Pausch '82, a renowned expert in computer science, human-computer interaction, and design who died of complications from pancreatic cancer in 2008 and whose "Last Lecture" has been widely praised. "I didn't know Randy when I was at Brown," Peter says, "but we met afterward and corresponded for many years. His story is inspiring, and this is an opportunity to remember him."
Norvig sees this award as a "multiplier" that will amplify the value of his gift and extend it through time. "I'm interested in students with a wide range of personalities and interests," he says, "and in putting students and faculty together. In the past, we had to build all our own tools, and we didn't have time to combine computer science with other fields. Now, there are so many opportunities to do so. I think it's a wise choice: you invest in things that you think will do good, and educating a student allows them to help add to the things that you're already trying to accomplish." 
Last year, the award went to Evan Cater, who used the funds to explore autonomous agents that operate under uncertain conditions with Professor Michael LiIttman.
To apply, no later than February 9, 2020, students should email Associate Professor (Research) and Vice Chair Tom Doeppner either: (A) a copy of their summer UTRA application or (B) a two-page description of their proposed research and a letter of support from the Brown CS faculty member that they intend to work with.
Brown CS PhD student Evangelia Anna (Lilika) Markatou has just won the Best Student Paper Award for her paper “Full Database Reconstruction with Access and Search Pattern Leakage” (coauthored with her advisor, Professor Roberto Tamassia) presented at the International Security Conference (ISC). They also coauthored a second paper on “Mitigation Techniques for Attacks on 1-Dimensional Databases that Support Range Queries” presented at the same conference. Held last week in New York City, ISC is an annual international conference covering research in theory and applications of information security.
“The widespread use of cloud computing,” the authors explain, “has enabled several database providers to store their data on servers in the cloud and answer queries from those servers. In order to protect the confidentiality of data in the cloud, a database can be stored in encrypted form and all queries can be executed on the encrypted database. Recent research results suggest that a curious cloud provider may be able to decrypt some of the items in the database after seeing a large number of queries and their (encrypted) results.” In this paper, Lilika and Roberto focus on one-dimensional databases that support range queries and develop an attack that can achieve full database reconstruction, inferring the exact value of every element in the database. 
“You’re going to be in a room someday,” says Sydney Skybetter, Lecturer at Brown’s Department of Theatre Arts and Performance Studies. “Where your colleagues are designing technologies intent on targeting other people’s bodies, with the aim of manipulating them, and potentially causing harm. As a computer scientist, you will have a voice in that room. When that happens, I want you to be able to speak in the interests of broader civic good, not institutional inertia or surveillance capital.”
A choreographer, speaker, and producer, Sydney is the founder of the Conference for Research on Choreographic Interfaces, and he’s giving a talk (“Dark Elegies: The Choreographics of Surveillant Systems and National Defense”) at Brown CS on October 4. His interest in the relationship between choreography and surveillance dates back to 2015, when, while teaching at Harvard University, he learned about “Marauder’s Map,” a web browser extension that revealed the extent to which the Facebook platform was tracking users’ movements and physical locations.
“I was getting ready to teach students about seventeenth-century pirate dances, as you do,” Sydney remembers, “and this just blew me away, the social gamifying of private location data. Who was watching this? What was the platform gleaning from it? A precondition for most dances is an audience, and with Facebook we had human movement being mined for meaning not only by people, but machines.”
Before long, Skybetter was deeply engaged with what he calls the intertwined histories of computer science and contemporary dance. Examples abound: Bell Labs scientist, A. Michael Noll, created the first digital dance in 1965 after seeing the New York City Ballet in concert, and several commonly-used motion capture systems contain movement data obtained from choreographers Bill T. Jones and Merce Cunningham in context of the AIDS crisis of the 1990s.
As a recent case study, Sydney mentions the Apple Watch: “The scientists who created the product weren’t just trying to track bodies, they were distinguishing between the intentionality of certain gestures. They tried to define what certain, supposedly universal movements meant, but meanwhile, lots of folks weren’t (and aren’t) invited to contribute their embodied experiences: folks of color, folks with disabilities, folks with varying cultural expectations pertaining to bodily expressiveness.” 
Given what Sydney sees as a troubling history of people’s bodies and movement being seen as objects, as data, he sees great value in computer science students thinking of the body specifically not as an abstraction. “We’re in a moment where CS is reconsidering its relationship to the arts and humanities,” he says, “and choreography frames this eloquently. What happens when we put bodies first?”
Which brings us to his talk (“Dark Elegies: The Choreographics of Surveillant Systems and National Defense”) on October 4, which he hopes students will see as an opportunity to broach questions of bodily ethics but also as a doorway into a line of study that can be social and fun. “Dance and choreography,” he says, “are unlike what many students have seriously studied before. They help us understand the tangible ways the world affects our selves, and develop an understanding of our own embodiment that contributes to understanding others.”
Some of his best students, Sydney notes, have been those with CS experience. “There are specific kinds of research problems,” he says, “that people with backgrounds in computation and dance are uniquely able to address.” Monica Roy is a sophomore with experience in ballet and modern dance who is concentrating in CS and serving as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for CSCI 0170. “Over the summer, Monica helped parse some of the technical papers from the Snowden leaks, and kept specific tabs on how the NSA understands time, space, and body movement. This material is uniquely legible to her because of her background in dance and tech.”
Sydney hopes that Brown CS students will also be interested in the Conference for Research on Choreographic Interfaces, which will take place on March 6 and 7. “We’ll have people there working through questions of bodies and emerging technologies, representing an incredibly wide spectrum of expertise. Every year we facilitate conversations between artists and computer scientists that value equally the expertise of both. It’s a dorky fun nerd gaggle.” But also deadly serious, he says, as the participants at times consider the dystopic possibilities of their work.
“None of this is easy,” he says. “But scientists need to be able to talk about bodies. It’s something we can practice. Dance helps us rehearse these negotiations. As a future participant in a room where decisions about surveillant technologies will be made, you can either go with the sway of the group, or you can force consideration of how your decisions affect others. This kind of tech moves fast. Chances are good that if you don’t add friction in the moment, nobody else will.”
Founded almost thirty years ago, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is one of the leading nonprofit organizations defending civil liberties in the digital world. In 1992, they established their Pioneer Award to recognize leaders on the electronic frontier who are extending freedom and innovation in the realm of information technology. The list of previous winners is formidable (it includes Anita Borg, Tim Berners-Lee, Douglas Engelbart, and Limor Fried), and on September 12, 2019, Brown CS alum and Advisory Board member danah boyd joined them alongside author William Gibson and surveillance-fighting organization Oakland Privacy.
In her acceptance speech, danah addressed what she called a "great reckoning" that's begun to occur in response to a patriarchial and exclusionist industry whose values, she says, have been lost or violated. "People can change," she said. "Institutions can change. But doing so requires all who harmed — and all who benefited from harm — to come forward, admit their mistakes, and actively take steps to change the power dynamics. It requires everyone to hold each other accountable, but also to aim for reconciliation not simply retribution."
She also offered advice on how to achieve this: "Let’s stop designing the technologies envisioned in dystopian novels. We need to heed the warnings of artists, not race head-on into their nightmares. Let’s focus on hearing the voices and experiences of those who have been harmed because of the technologies that made this industry so powerful. And let’s collaborate with and design alongside those communities to fix these wrongs, to build just and empowering technologies rather than those that reify the status quo."
Currently working as a Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research, danah is the founder and president of the Data and Society Research Institute and serves as a Visiting Professor at New York University. She also serves on the boards of Crisis Text Line and Social Science Research Council and is a Trustee of the National Museum of the American Indian. Widely recognized as an authority in the field of social media research, her recent work focuses on how data-driven technologies can amplify inequities, mistrust, and hate. This recognition by the EFF is the latest in a long list of accomplishments, including (most recently) being named to the Forbes Top 50 Women in Tech, winning the Award for Public Sociology from the American Sociological Association, and being named the “smartest academic in the technology field” by Fortune.
"Here we are," said Brown CS Professor Andries "Andy" van Dam in 1987, "and we have to ask, perhaps rhetorically, has hypertext arrived?" He was delivering a keynote address at the first ACM Hypertext Conference (text available here) in which he credited visionaries Doug Engelbart and Ted Nelson, reviewed Brown's hypertext experiments to date, and talked about nine issues facing the linked world, ranging from standards and accessibility to sociopolitico-economic problems. "Hypertext is basically clay, and we have to mold it; that is what this workshop is all about: starting to mold that clay."
Three decades later, Andy will return to the conference for its thirtieth anniversary to again deliver a keynote ("Reflections on a Half-Century of Hypertext"), this time in Hof, Germany, on September 17. As part of his remarks, he'll be looking back on five decades of Brown hypermedia systems and demoing three of them (FRESS, from the late ‘60s, TAG, from 2017, and Dash, under development), presenting them in the context of the research trends that ultimately led to the interconnected society in which we live.
"What I did not predict," he says, referring back to the visions of pioneers like Engelbart, "is that 50 years later the revolution in human-centered computing would remain far too unfinished in terms of its positive societal impact. Indeed, that impact and utility are increasingly in jeopardy from a variety of forces, both economic and political. I will close with some thoughts on both deliberately designed and unanticipated societal issues of social media that I feel we technologists must urgently help address."
Andy's keynote will be livestreamed on September 17: see the event's website for details.
Computer science that benefits humanity, science that’s grounded in an awareness of its societal impact, has long been a Brown CS hallmark. Today, more than forty years after the founding of the department, global concern about the ethical and societal issues surrounding computing is greater than ever. This semester brings a new departmental initiative, Socially Responsible Computing, which will place the exploration of those issues broadly at the heart of the Brown CS undergraduate experience. 
In the last few years, the department has started to offer a number of courses that exclusively address the ethical and societal impact of CS. These include Cybersecurity Ethics (new this fall); Data, Ethics and Society; and CS for Social Change. While these courses allow students to explore these subjects in depth, Brown CS felt it was important to cover ethical and societal issues in as many courses as possible and as frequently as possible.
“Computer science doesn’t happen in a vacuum,” says Professor Ugur Cetintemel. “Having individual courses on these topics can make it look like ethics is just a box to check, and that can sometimes cause students to think they’re 'done' after completing a single course.” Several CS classes have already been incorporating ethical and societal issues in their course material, he explains, and instructors from other classes had expressed an interest in doing so with more institutional support. That’s what led to the creation of the Socially Responsible Computing program.
Looking to benefit from the insights of other disciplines, as well as to trigger excitement around these topics across the campus, Brown CS began engaging with relevant campus units that include Philosophy, Science and Technology Studies, and Modern Culture and Media (MCM). Their knowledge is being put to use by a newly-formed group of Undergraduate Teaching Assistants (UTAs), the STAs. Under the supervision of Brown CS faculty, the STAs are working with course staff and graduate students from the partner units to create customized content for each class that examines ethical and societal issues in computer science. 
It’s a pilot, and one whose results will be closely watched, with an eye to expanding the initiative in the semesters to follow.
“The goal,” says Jessica Dai, one of the Head STAs, “is that Brown CS grads will be thinking about and driving responsible tech wherever their work may take them. We aren't prescribing absolute morality judgments, but hope that the additional questions we raise and context we provide will help lead students to think about ethics in the long term. We're partnering with courses directly, embedding ethics education in technical course content.”
Strong Interest
The first step was to recruit the initial cohort of STAs, and interest was immediate and strong. Brown CS received more than double the number of applications needed to fill the positions, and eventually chose ten students for the pilot: Lena Cohen, Jessica Dai, Signe Golash, Heila Precel, Andrew Rickert, TzuHwan Seet, Kendrick Tan, Hal Triedman, Stanley Yip, and Rebecca Zuo. Jessica and Stanley are serving as Head STAs. It’s a multidisciplinary group, with most of the students pursuing or planning to pursue double concentrations in areas such as History, Philosophy, and MCM.
Enthusiasm from faculty members and course staff was equally emphatic, with numerous courses hoping to take part. Professor Jeff Huang says that ethics has always been a component of his classes. “I’m interested,” he explains, “in helping students articulate their own principles for determining the ethical boundaries of the products they design.”
In the end, based on STA familiarity with the course material, Brown CS chose five classes, prioritizing introductory courses and ones with high enrollment in order to maximize early exposure, number of students affected, and impact. They include the following, with two STAs assigned per class: CS 15 Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming, CS 17 CS: An Integrated Introduction, CS 111 Computing Foundations: Data, CS 130 User Interfaces and User Experience, and CS 147 Deep Learning. The STAs have been working over the summer with the staff of their assigned courses to create integration plans for the new content. During the semester, the STAs will continue to play a supporting role, working with course staff to develop, deliver, and grade the content.
“In CS 15,” says Professor Andries “Andy” van Dam, “over the last few years I’ve had ‘IT in the News’ segments at the beginning of each class, mostly devoted to social impact and issues of our technology. This year we plan to have our assigned STAs, both former CS 15 TAs, lecture on ethics and social-impact-related topics during these segments.”
Getting Started
Over the summer, the STAs have been busy. With a focus on three general areas (ethical software development and data analysis, biases and other ethical pitfalls, and using computing for societal good), they’ve been doing the following:
The STAs identified the following principles to organize the coverage of this material in courses:
“My goal,” says Professor Doug Woos, “is to treat ethics as much as possible as part of the core curriculum, rather than as something extra or external that we've bolted on. In particular, I'd love to see students really putting themselves in the shoes of practitioners who are making engineering decisions with social consequences, in the hopes that they’ll understand how those decisions get made, what the pressures are, and how to make ethical choices.”
“I want every CS 17 student to understand,” says Professor John Hughes, “that every program they write (especially those they release to the world) has an impact, and that the extent of the impact may be far from obvious; that every program specification involves subtle choices that have consequences –did my choice of string representation mean that this program is usable only by people who use US English and the associated character sets?– and that even with ethical guidelines, many of the decisions we make in computer science may be very difficult.“
Looking Ahead
As the semester progresses, Brown CS will evaluate the pilot’s success and plan the initiative’s future. Goals for the next phase of Socially Responsible Computing include: 
Professor Daniel Ritchie is eager to see students thinking critically about the ethical issues of deep learning. “My goal,” he says, “is for them to leave the course having developed an 'ethics-first' mindset: that they naturally consider the implications of the models they’re building as they’re building them, rather than as an afterthought.”
“I'm incredibly excited about the mission of this program,” says Stanley Yip, one of the two Head STAs. “It's of utmost importance, especially now, for computer scientists to have the skills necessary to think critically about ethical choices and answer ethical dilemmas that they will experience throughout their career. Ideally, every student leaves Brown CS with these abilities, regardless of which courses they took.”
It could be said that Malte Schwarzkopf, who joins Brown CS as Assistant Professor this fall, prefers the long view, and perhaps the wide-angle lens: “Efficiency of datacenter systems is one of the major tracks of my research because the data center stack is important to all of us. Awake or asleep, hundreds of computers are doing things on our behalf, and if they do them inefficiently, that can be expensive and wasteful. How can humanity improve on that? With today’s systems, it’s easy to do a lot of computation at the flick of a switch, but many of these systems are not very discerning in their resource use, and we should aim to do better.”
One way to begin that process, Malte finds, is by excavating the past, and his favorite possessions include a layperson’s guide to technology from 1828. “It illustrates how progress has happened, and creates a connection with people who lived in a very different world,” he says, “and that’s fascinating to me.” On one page, electricity is listed as a curiosity for which no practical use has been found, but one of the book’s owners worked to keep it current by adding annotations and newspaper clippings, including one of the Wright brothers taking to the air for the first time.
“History helps explain why things are the way they are and why we think the way we do. One great example from computer systems research is that only two decades ago,” Malte explains, “we didn’t have journaling file systems, and I have a vivid memory of Windows 95 crashing during an OS upgrade and running ScanDisk to figure out what had happened and repair the file system. It’s totally different now: all major operating systems use journaling file systems to prevent these problems from arising in the first place. I find it very satisfying to learn from the past when I try to invent new things, and to see what impact computer systems research can have even in, by the dimensions of history, a very short term.”
Most recently, Malte’s research produced Noria, a new system that makes websites more efficient by reducing the redundant computation done at their backend. Noria uses a technique called “dataflow computing” to efficiently precompute the data that the website’s frontend might request. This ensures that reads – which are much more common than writes in these applications – are maximally efficient, improving the load served with the same hardware by 5-74x over common industry practice. In his prior work on datacenter systems, Malte developed cluster schedulers, systems for data science on big data, and a new datacenter network design. His work has received best paper awards at EuroSys 2013 (for the Omega cluster scheduler) and NSDI 2015 (for the QJump datacenter network design).
Schwarzkopf’s introduction to computers came at age seven or eight, in the form of an IBM PC with a 386 processor running at 25 MHz. It was a pretty typical first experience, he says: “I was growing up in Hamburg, and it had been surplused at the insurance company where my father worked, so he brought it home for us. We kept it in the basement and it was a lot of fun.”
Talk of the era before flat screens and smartphones brings us to the second track of Malte’s research. “Unlike in those days,” he says, “our data lives remotely now, and our computers and devices are really just portals. This creates trustworthiness problems about our data being lost, destroyed, or sold that are very much unresolved. Systems play an unappreciated role in this. If we create them in a free-for-all environment, we often end up with bad outcomes, but when we define some parameters, we may get a degree of assurance, a reason to trust.”
By the end of primary school, Malte had started programming in the form of writing macros for Microsoft Office. Self-taught, he eventually became the systems administrator for his high school’s computer system. It was a grassroots effort, he says, with students running the show and building computers themselves, and it was likely the origin for his applied computer science perspective. In the years that followed at the University of Cambridge, Schwarzkopf credits Steven Hand, who later became his PhD advisor, with inspiring his love of systems.
“Broadly speaking,” he says, “I’m interested in all flavors of computer systems, but my recent work has focused on data centers. It’s an interesting area and things are still in flux, with hardware and software always presenting new demands.” Malte’s doctoral research focused on operating systems for large data centers, including work on cluster schedulers, which provide a kind of brain for the data center by deciding which servers should process which work in order to be most efficient.  “Currently, I’m very interested in dataflow systems, as I believe they’re a great abstraction for building scalable infrastructure that is easy to use, but also to reason about.” 
As his research continues, Malte sees Brown as a perfect home for someone who wants to take risks and look ten years down the road instead of being bound to a six-month industry cycle. “And I love teaching,” he says. “I really enjoy seeing students I mentor grow into researchers, and I’m passionate about diversity because we need to move beyond the stereotypes. Even though I work in systems, you don’t need to have been hacking on a kernel in your basement since you were nine. You need to be curious about how things work, keen to build new things, and enjoy tackling intellectual challenges. My wife is a political philosopher, and she provides a lot of input for my research. The best questions come from people who see links and bring a different perspective and are curious – that’s more important than the number of lines of code you have written. We need that broad spectrum.”
The most enjoyable moments of teaching, Malte says, are when neither nor he nor his students know a particular answer, but they approach the problem together. He’s hoping for many such moments in his new course (CSCI 2390 Privacy-Conscious Computer Systems), which focuses on systems that protect user data by design through enforcing predefined rules. “We need that kind of two-way learning because so many of these problems are unsolved, even for simple web apps. We need to find ways for companies to run back-end systems that won’t harm users, and a lot of theoretical work has been done in this area, but many of the concepts are impractical and will never be deployed. Legislators are waking up, and they’re asking for system designs that better protect sensitive information at a cost where people can use them.”
Ultimately, Schwarzkopf hopes that he and his students will respond to that need with feasible, affordable, and efficient solutions. The way to build them, he says, is by challenging each other to be better engineers, and more responsible ones: “Building practical systems is in my DNA, and I want to keep doing that with my students, making things that work and are worthy of trust and have some certainty of becoming widely used.” 
Perhaps someday they’ll be able to write their own names among the marginalia of that book of his. “As academic researchers,” Malte says, “we’re part of history. We’re telling our future selves why they do what they do as scientists, as creative humans.”
This year's ACM SIGMOD (Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Management of Data) conference was held in Amsterdam, and members of the Brown CS community returned from the event with two notable awards. PhD candidates Philipp Eichmann, Franco Solleza, and Junjay Tan; alum Nesime Tatbul; and Professor Stan Zdonik received the Best Demonstration Award and alums Nathaniel Weir and P. Ajie Utama earned Second Place in the Undergraduate category of the Student Research Competition.
Philipp, Franco, Junjay, Nesime, and Stan's research ("Visual Exploration of Time Series Anomalies with Metro-Viz") presents a novel data visualization solution for exploring the results of time series anomaly detection systems. "When anomalies are reported," they explain, "there's a need to reason about the results, and so we introduce Metro-Viz, a visual tool to assist data scientists in performing this analysis." Metro-Viz offers a rich set of interaction features, including comparative analysis and what-if testing, backed by data management strategies specifically tailored to the workload. In their demo, they showed the tool in action via multiple time series datasets and anomaly detectors.
The project's web site is here, and the researchers are recognized in the first three minutes of the award session video here. 
Nathaniel and P. Ajie's research ("Bootstrapping an End-to-End, Cross-Domain NLI for Databases") offers an end-to-end Natural Language Interfaces for Databases (NLIDB) framework in which a neural translation model is trained for any new database schema with minimal manual overhead. "The ability to extract insights from data," they write, "is critical for decision making. Intuitive natural language interfaces to databases provide non-technical users with an effective way to formulate complex questions and information needs efficiently and effectively." In addition to being the first off-the-shelf, neural machine translation based system of its kind, their project's other contribution is its use of a synthetic training set generation pipeline used to bootstrap a translation model without requiring manually curated data. In experiments, they show that their system can achieve competitive performance on the recently released benchmarks for nl-to-sql translation.

Nishanth Kumar is an Undergraduate Research Assistant in Brown CS Professor Stefanie Tellex's Humans 2 Robots Lab whose interests include robotics, artificial intelligence, and using hardware and software to create truly useful products. Last semester, he was selected as a Plenary Speaker for the Ivy League Undergraduate Research Symposium (ILURS) 2019 for his research ("Action-Oriented Semantic Maps via Mixed Reality") with alum Eric Rosen, Brown CLPS PhD student Daniel Ullman, alum David Whitney, Professor George Konidaris, and Stefanie. While there, he was recognized as Best Plenary Presentation, the conference's top honor.
Asked about his research, Nishanth explains that if we want robots to operate robustly in human-centered environments, they need to bridge the gab between their internal models and objects, actions, and tasks in the real world. "Semantic maps," he says, "are the prototypical representation for grounded robot knowledge about objects and attributes, but they don't naturally include information about actions. In our work, we present a novel approach to bridging the semantic gap via Action-Oriented Semantic Maps (AOSMs): semantic maps that also model the possible consequences of actions."
Nishanth's presentation can be found here and the official research demonstration video is here.
Professor Jeff Huang of Brown CS has just received an Army Research Office Young Investigator Award, which is given to support the research and encourage the careers of outstanding young university faculty members. Jeff's Brown HCI research group focuses on behavior-powered systems, and their goal is to invent new, personalized applications from remotely-captured user behavioral data. The award will support Jeff and his students in research investigating how emotional cues can be inferred from large-scale social messages, particularly on mobile devices.
The goal is to identify which aspects of social messaging affect emotion, and in what way do different social features such as frequency, content, timing, and recipients of messages influence affect. This research builds on existing work the HCI group has done with Sochiatrist, a social extractor that automatically dumps and anonymizes social communication data (like texting and Facebook messages) and combines it with biomarker data and qualitative interviews done by clinical researchers to find correlations. The project is in collaboration with clinical psychiatrists from Rhode Island Hospital who have collected data about mental health patients and the funded research proposes to work with veterans, who are particularly at risk of mental health issues.
“I’m eager to start this research, and we’ve already started exploring the unique nature of messaging, which is noticeably different from formal English, and how to find signals of social support and moments of reveal,” Jeff explains. “I’m excited about working on this with students in my group who have thought about the machine learning aspects of messaging, together with graduate students admitted into our group in the fall who have both computer science and psychology backgrounds.”
Jeff has previously received another early CAREER award from the NSF for research on modeling user behaviors on mobile devices.  
"Computer science education," says Professor Shriram Krishnamurthi of Brown CS, "is a difficult and fascinating problem, sitting at the intersection of the technical and human." In a recent plenary talk ("The Role of Computer Science in Computer Science Education") on June 26 at ACM FCRC, he showed how solving even seemingly simple educational problems requires applying results from several areas of technical computer science.
A recording of the plenary talk is available here.
Shriram's other recent invited talks include keynotes at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne's Teaching Computational Thinking Workshop (video available here) and Programming 2018.
Professor Sohini Ramachandran of Brown University's Center for Computational Molecular Biology (she also serves as its Director) and Department of Computer Science has just received a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE). Sohini's Ramachandran Group of researchers addresses problems in population genetics and evolutionary theory, generally using humans as a study system. Their work uses mathematical modeling, applied statistical methods, and computer simulations to make inferences from genetic data. 
The PECASE is the highest honor bestowed by the United States Government to outstanding scientists and engineers who are beginning their independent research careers and who show exceptional promise for leadership in science and technology. Established in 1996, it acknowledges the contributions scientists and engineers have made to the advancement of science, technology, education, and mathematics education and to community service as demonstrated through scientific leadership, public education, and community outreach.
"I’m very honored," Sohini says, "to have been nominated by the National Institutes of Health in the Department of Health and Human Services for this award. My research program focuses on studying the causes and consequences of human genomic variation, entirely from a mathematical and computational perspective. My becoming a PECASE awardee underscores that quantitative approaches in biology are equal partners with molecular, cellular, and organismal biomedical research in helping us understand the origins and diversity of life, as well as how to improve human health."
Sohini was one of just three PECASE winners from Rhode Island, along with Professor Anita Shukla of Brown's School of Engineering and Center for Biological Engineering. She joins Professor Amy Greenwald of Brown CS, a previous PECASE winner.
A full list of recipients is available here.
"In today's security environment," says Professor Seny Kamara of Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS), "we believe it's necessary to have systems that fully encrypt the user's data at every point in its life cycle." He's talking about end-to-end encryption, the focus of his Encrypted Systems Lab and new startup Aroki Systems. Last year, the Encrypted Systems Lab's research saw fruit in the release of an app, Pixek, which uses structured encryption (a kind of encryption Seny co-invented in 2010 with Brown PhD Melissa Chase) to provide a simple solution for keeping photos private while in the cloud. More recently, Seny and Aroki co-founder Tarik Moataz have been putting their expertise to good use at an entirely different scale.
Due to Seny and Tarik's expertise in designing and cryptanalyzing encrypted search algorithms, MongoDB asked for an analysis of a new product feature called Field Level Encryption. MongoDB, co-founded by Brown CS alum Eliot Horowitz, is a general-purpose, document-based, distributed database built for modern applications in the cloud era. It's used by millions of developers worldwide and some of the largest organizations in the world including Adobe, Facebook, Google, and Verizon. Field Level Encryption uses local keys on a client to ensure that data will be inaccessible even to servers run by cloud providers and database managers. It's an increase in security for database users who previously had been vulnerable to hackers and rogue agents abusing access.
"It’s exciting to see industry involving the research community and leveraging our expertise," Tarik says. "MongoDB are great to work with and are very receptive to our findings."
An algorithm developed by Brown University computer scientists enables robots to put pen to paper, writing words using stroke patterns similar to human handwriting. It’s a step, the researchers say, toward robots that are able to communicate more fluently with human co-workers and collaborators.
“Just by looking at a target image of a word or sketch, the robot can reproduce each stroke as one continuous action,” said Atsunobu Kotani, an undergraduate student at Brown who led the algorithm’s development. “That makes it hard for people to distinguish if it was written by the robot or actually written by a human.”
The algorithm makes use of deep learning networks that analyze images of handwritten words or sketches and can deduce the likely series of pen strokes that created them. The robot can then reproduce the words or sketches using the pen strokes it learned. In a paper presented at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation in May, the researchers demonstrated a robot that was able to write “hello” in ten languages that employ different character sets. The robot was also able to reproduce rough sketches, including one of the Mona Lisa.
Stefanie Tellex, an assistant professor of computer science at Brown and Kotani’s advisor, says that what makes this work unique is the ability of the robot to learn stroke order from scratch.
“A lot of the existing work in this area requires the robot to have information about the stroke order in advance,” Tellex said. “If you wanted the robot to write something, somebody would have to program the stroke orders each time. With what Atsu has done, you can draw whatever you want and the robot can reproduce it. It doesn’t always do the perfect stroke order, but it gets pretty close.”
Another remarkable aspect of the work, Tellex says, is how the algorithm was able to generalize its ability to reproduce strokes. Kotani trained his deep learning algorithm using a set of Japanese characters, and showed that it could reproduce the characters and the strokes that created them with around 93 percent accuracy. But much to the researchers’ surprise, the algorithm wound up being able to reproduce very different character types it had never seen before – English print and cursive, for example.
“We would have been happy if it had only learned the Japanese characters,” Tellex said. “But once it started working on English, we were amazed. Then we decided to see how far we could take it.”
Tellex and Kotani asked everyone who works in Tellex’s Humans to Robots lab to write “hello” in their native languages, which included Greek, Hindi, Urdu, Chinese and Yiddish among others. The robot was able to reproduce them all with reasonable stroke accuracy.
“I feel like there’s something really beautiful about the robot writing in so many different languages,” Tellex said. “I thought that was really cool.”
But the system’s masterwork may be its copy of Kotani’s Mona Lisa sketch. He drew his sketch on a dry erase board in Tellex’s lab, and then allowed the robot to copy it –fairly faithfully on the same board– just below Kotani’s original.
“It was early morning that our robot finally drew the Mona Lisa on the whiteboard,” Kotani said. “When I came back to the lab, everybody was standing around the whiteboard looking at the Mona Lisa and asking me if [the robot] drew this. They couldn’t believe it.”
It was a big moment for Kotani because “it was the moment that our robot defined what’s beyond mere printing.” An ink jet printer can recreate an image, but it does so with a print head that goes back in forth building the image line by line. But this was the robot creating an image with human-like strokes, which to Kotani is “something much more humane and expressive.”
Key to making the system work, Kotani says, is that the algorithm uses two distinct models of the image it’s trying to reproduce. Using a global model that considers the image as a whole, the algorithm identifies a likely starting point for making the first stroke. Once that stroke has begun, the algorithm zooms in, looking at the image pixel by pixel to determine where that stroke should go and how long it should be. When it reaches the end of the stroke, the algorithm again calls the global model to determine where the next stroke should start, then it’s back to the zoomed-in model. This process is repeated until the image is complete.
Both Kotani and Tellex say the work is a step toward better communication between people and robots. Ultimately, they envision robots that can leave Post-it Notes, take dictation or sketch diagrams for their human coworkers and collaborators.
“I want a robot to be able to do everything a person can do,” Tellex said. “I’m particularly interested in a robot that can use language. Writing is a way that people use language, so we thought we should try this.”
At this spring's Commencement ceremony in the Olney-Margolies Athletic Center, Brown CS presented undergraduate diplomas to 259 students. It was another historic number, beating previous records of 249 last year, 205 the year before, and 168 in 2016. Here are just a few of the places where our newest alums will be working:
Congratulations to everyone! We have tremendous respect for your talents and effort, and we wish you all the best in the days ahead.

From the IBM punch cards of the 1960’s to the machine learning labs of today, Brown University's Department of Computer Science has undergone decades of transformational change since its founding. The Brown CS Digital Archive (BCSDA) is a crowdsourced effort to preserve this history, curating items from faculty, staff, students, and alums that have contributed to Brown CS and preserving them permanently online, where they're accessible by all.
Started just a few months ago, the BCSDA has grown rapidly, with over 100 artifacts submitted to date. Ranging from handouts for the original Applied Math 101-102 computer science sequence to photos of the Brown University IBM System/360 model 67 (the main campus computing facility from 1970 to 1976), the archive encompasses a broad variety of photos, audio, PDFs, and even code that attempts to capture the story of Brown CS.
What’s contributed to the success of the archive? The efforts of Brown alums have surely played a huge role. Paul Anagnostopoulos ‘74 (thanks to alphabetical order, he was Brown's first undergraduate to receive a pure CS degree instead of a degree in Applied Mathematics with a concentration in CS) has been the top contributor to the archive, with over 80 items submitted. “I’ve coordinated many of our class reunions,” he explains, “and it really is a group effort to provide these things.” But with the archives at such an early stage, more submissions are needed to fully achieve the goals of the archive. “We need more artifacts from the 80s and 90s, the more obscure the better,” he laughs.
As participation increases, each new asset adds color and a bit of insight into the community that is Brown CS. “We're in the technology business and the change in technology is fascinating,” says Paul. “Remembering people is important. Everybody enjoyed what they were doing. People need to know what they did, and what projects they worked on.”
If you have something that you’d like to contribute to the archive, submitting an item is easy:
Within the span of a single year, Brown CS faculty members have won two of the field's highest distinctions for teaching: Professor Shriram Krishnamurthi received the SIGSOFT Influential Educator Award and Professor Andy van Dam earned the inaugural ACM SIGGRAPH Distinguished Educator Award. ("We're teaching twins," commented Andy when the two gathered for the photo above.) The honors are international recognition of continued strength in education for the Department of Computer Science, and they follow recent awards for three faculty members and two PhD students that highlight campus-wide recognition of Brown CS teaching excellence.
Presented annually, the SIGSOFT Influential Educator Award is given to an educator or educators who have made significant contributions to, and impact on, the field of software engineering through accomplishments as teachers, mentors, researchers (in education or learning), authors, and/or policy makers. In particular, the award committee noted Shriram's contributions to the advancement of the research and practice of software engineering. With this win, he joins Brown alum Barbara Ryder and the late David Notkin, a Brown CS alum, who won the prestigious award in 2015 and 2012, respectively. Both studied under Andy and David was one of van Dam's Head TAs.
Established less than a year ago, the SIGGRAPH Distinguished Educator Award is given annually to a member for outstanding pedagogical contributions to computer graphics and interactive techniques at any educational level or within the context of any discipline. It recognizes contributions in both innovative content and delivery. Nominated by the SIGGRAPH community, Andy was chosen based on award criteria that include impact on research and practice of education as it relates to computer graphics and interactive techniques, cumulative contributions to the field both directly and through leadership of others, and innovation in education.
The full list of SIGSOFT Influential Educator Award winners dating back to 2009 is available here.

On April 30, 2019, Brown CS Professor Seny Kamara was announced as a winner of The Responsible Computer Science Challenge from Omidyar Network, Mozilla, Schmidt Futures, and Craig Newmark Philanthropies. Seny worked in collaboration with colleagues Suresh Venkatasubramanian (University of Utah) and Sorelle A. Friedler (Haverford College) to “integrate ethics and responsibility into undergraduate computer science curricula and pedagogy at U.S. colleges and universities” according to Mozilla.
The Omidyar Network, Mozilla, Schmidt Futures, and Craig Newmark Philanthropies give this award to acknowledge the power computer scientists hold in society. This power comes with the responsibility to integrate ethics into the education of prospective computer scientists. “I think it is clear to everyone now that CS is having a major impact on individuals and societies. This impact, however, is not always positive,” Seny explains, “and we need computer scientists to understand this and to strive to design and build better technologies for everyone. We need to teach our students more than how to design fast algorithms and how to build profitable companies.”
Seny and his colleagues were inspired to apply for this award due to their experience and understanding of the current limits of CS curricula. “All three of us had been thinking individually about the fact that the traditional CS curriculum really needed to be expanded to include the ethics and social responsibility of CS,” he explains. Seny is well-versed in privacy and surveillance while his colleagues, Suresh and Sorelle, have experience with algorithmic fairness which has informed their awareness of technology’s potential to harmfully impact society. These experiences made the decision to apply for the challenge simple. The process of writing their proposal was challenging yet enjoyable for all three since they had the opportunity to discuss various socially impactful topics.
Recognizing that CS students are first introduced to problem solving methods when evaluating their solutions and must keep in mind the resources they have available to them, Seny and his colleagues plan to use the funds from the prize to normalize curriculum design. This provides students with a strong technical foundation to actively integrate questions about how marginalized groups in different communities are impacted by technology. This curriculum aims to condition students to think about the inequality in global society as a natural part of their studies in CS. He believes the performance motivated culture of CS education results in a lack of ethical designs.
Seny and his colleagues plan to approach this issue by equipping students with a direct knowledge of the impact the tech field has on society. By integrating questions involving issues in society into the data structures and algorithms curriculum, students begin their CS education with a foundation that allows them to ethically problem solve. This sets the stage for a more ethically based CS community in education at Brown University.
"This award reinforces our own departmental initiative that aims to integrate in our curriculum material on the ethical and societal implications of computing.” says Ugur Cetintemel, Department Chair. “As a first step, ten ‘Ethics TAs’ will be working with a number of courses this fall to develop and deliver such content. We plan to grow the number of Ethics TAs and the number of supported courses in subsequent semesters. Congratulations to Seny and his collaborators!"
In light of the award, Seny says: “I’m excited to work on expanding and changing the algorithms and data structure curriculum. I teach CS 16 and although we’ve had material about algorithmic fairness in the course since 2018, we will now be able to add a lot more content and assignments related to responsible CS. I’m really happy that Mozilla and its partners put this together and I’m excited to get started.”
In a ceremony on June 15, 2019, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the world’s largest educational and professional computing society, elevated Professor Michael Littman of Brown CS to the rank of Fellow, the organization's highest membership grade, for contributions to the design and analysis of sequential decision-making algorithms in artificial intelligence. The ACM Fellows Program, initiated in 1993, celebrates the exceptional contributions of leading members of the computing field, and Michael joins a distinguished list of colleagues to whom the ACM and its members look for guidance and leadership in computing and information technology.
"It was an honor to be selected as a Fellow," Michael says, "and I really enjoyed the ceremony and hearing about all the remarkable achievements of the big award winners. Computing is such an exciting field right now and getting to see so many important figures in the field in one place was a total trip."  
Michael earned his doctorate from Brown CS in 1996 and has been a member of the faculty since 2012. Currently co-directing Brown’s Humanity-Centered Robotics Initiative, he works mainly in reinforcement learning, but has done research in machine learning, game theory, computer networking, partially observable Markov decision process solving, computer solving of analogy problems, and other areas. He's earned multiple awards for teaching and research and has served on the editorial boards for The Journal of Machine Learning Research and The Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research. He served as General Chair of the International Conference on Machine Learning and Program Chair of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) Conference in 2013. He's also an AAAI Fellow and Co-Chair of the upcoming Reinforcement Learning and Decision Making Conference, to be held in 2019 in Montreal.
In a ceremony on June 15, 2019, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the world’s largest educational and professional computing society, presented Robert Sedgewick (William O. Baker '39 Professor at Princeton University) with the Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award for developing classic textbooks and online materials for the study of algorithms, analytic combinatorics, and introductory computer science that have educated generations of students worldwide. Robert is not only a Brown University alum (Bachelor of Science in 1968 and Master's of Science in 1970) but one of the initial seven Brown CS faculty members. He's the second Brown CS winner of the award, following Andy van Dam, whom he thanked during his acceptance speech.
Robert is best known for his series of algorithms textbooks, which have been bestsellers for four decades (12 books in four editions covering five programming languages). The books develop a scientific approach to the study of algorithms, based on experiments with real code to validate hypotheses about performance based on mathematical analysis. His recent book (with Kevin Wayne), Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach, is a comprehensive introduction to the field and was named by ACM Computing Reviews as a “Best of Computing Notable Book” for 2017. His book Analytic Combinatorics (with Philippe Flajolet) is an advanced graduate text that has been recognized with the 2019 Leroy P. Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition. More recently, Sedgewick has been extremely active as a pioneer and innovator in online education. He has co-developed extensive online content associated with his books that attract millions of visitors annually. Robert has also recorded over 100 hours of online lectures on programming, computer science, and algorithms that reach hundreds of thousands of people around the world. The Sedgewick-Wayne Algorithms online course has been listed as one of the top 10 Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) of all time.
The Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award is presented annually to an educator who has been appointed to a recognized educational baccalaureate institution, recognized for advancing new teaching methodologies or effecting new curriculum development or expansion in computer science and engineering, or who has made a significant contribution to the educational mission of the ACM. It's accompanied by a prize of ten thousand dollars, with financial support provided by Pearson Education.
Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) is pleased to announce that Assistant Professor George Konidaris has become the inaugural holder of the John E. Savage Endowed Professorship in Computer Science. First announced by President Christina Paxson at John's fiftieth anniversary celebration, the professorship was funded with very generous gifts from John's family and friends, and is now the first of what will be ten new endowed professorships in the CS With Impact expansion. As part of this effort, Brown CS will raise a minimum of $40 million to create ten new endowed chairs, which will be supplemented with the creation of five lecturer positions, for a total of fifteen new faculty slots.
"John has been someone I've looked up to since I joined the department that he co-founded," said Konidaris. "He has an incredible record –over half a century!– of technical innovation, dedicated service to Brown, and real public impact. I feel immensely honored to be the first holder of the chair endowed in his name."
A member of the Brown CS faculty since 2016, George is the director of the Intelligent Robot Lab, which aims to build intelligent, autonomous, general-purpose robots that are generally capable in a wide variety of tasks and environments. His many  honors include, most recently, an NSF CAREER Award, a Salomon Award, a DARPA Director's Fellowship, and an AFOSR Young Investigator Research Award.
"I am very pleased that George Konidaris is the inaugural holder of a chair in my name," says John. "George has a bright career ahead of him."
George joins seven other holders of Brown CS endowed professorships: Eugene Charniak (University Professor of Computer Science), Maurice Herlihy (An Wang Professor of Computer Science), Sorin Istrail (Julie Nguyen Brown Professor of Computational and Mathematical Sciences and Professor of Computer Science), Roberto Tamassia (Plastech Professor of Computer Science), Stefanie Tellex (Joukowsky Family Assistant Professor of Computer Science), Eliezer Upfal (Rush Hawkins Professor of Computer Science), and Andries van Dam (Thomas J. Watson, Jr., University Professor of Technology and Education and Professor of Computer Science).
Now in his ninth decade, it remains to be seen whether Brown CS Professor Andries van Dam is slowing down. He's just become the inaugural recipient of the ACM SIGGRAPH Distinguished Educator Award, one of the organization's highest honors. 
Established less than a year ago, the award is given annually to a member for outstanding pedagogical contributions to computer graphics and interactive techniques at any educational level or within the context of any discipline. It recognizes contributions in both innovative content and delivery. Nominated by the SIGGRAPH community, Andy was chosen based on award criteria that include impact on research and practice of education as it relates to computer graphics and interactive techniques, cumulative contributions to the field both directly and through leadership of others, and innovation in education.
Last week, Brown CS celebrated a half-century of pioneering hypertext research by Andy and his collaborators, and the Distinguished Educator Award offers yet another reason to raise a glass to van Dam's innovation. He was also named to the SIGGRAPH Academy just last year. Andy will receive this latest award at either the North American SIGGRAPH conference or the SIGGRAPH Asia conference.
PhD candidate David Abel of Brown CS, who just recently proposed his thesis and expects to graduate with a PhD in Computer Science and a Master’s in Philosophy next spring, has been recognized for an accomplishment beyond his achievements in research. Chosen out of hundreds of graduate students with teaching appointments, Dave was one of only four to win the Presidential Award for Excellence in Teaching.
The award, given annually at the University Awards ceremony, recognizes outstanding pedagogical achievement. Its criteria span from teaching that influences and inspires students to learn to development of curriculum and resources that promote student learning.
Dave began his teaching journey in 2014 as a TA for Stefanie Tellex, teaching CS 1410 (an undergraduate Artificial Intelligence class). After being nominated as a “great TA” by the students in the class, he became a TA for CS 8 (A First Byte of Computer Science), an introductory computer science class for non-majors taught by Professor Michael Littman with enrollment of 109 students. During his semester of teaching the course, Dave was consistently praised by his students, with many citing his “energy, availability, and thoughtfulness” as being key to fostering an environment for intellectual curiosity. Dave was instrumental in implementing an optional python unit in the class that gave students the opportunity to learn a language used widely in industry. As a testament to his teaching abilities, a full 98.5% of respondents rated the class as effective or very effective when Michael took a sabbatical and Dave ran the class on his own.
Not limited to the classroom, Dave has been involved in a variety of activities that may very well have had an even greater impact on the Brown community. Along with fellow CS PhD students Nediyana Daskalova and Amariah Becker, Dave has been heavily involved in designing and running peer mentorship program in the department. His initiative pairs up post-candidacy PhD students with first year PhD students, ensuring that new students have proper guidance regarding finding research, working with their advisor, and establishing work-life balance. Keeping with the spirit of mentorship, Dave has been a primary research advisor for several Brown undergraduates as well. Over the past few years, he has co-authored 11 papers with many undergraduate students, guiding them through the research process.
Dave has clearly shown himself to be a remarkable teacher, both in and outside the classroom. As he finishes up his graduate studies, it's evident that his work has made a personal impact on the many dozens of students with whom he has worked.
Professor of Medical Science and Computer Science Carsten Eickhoff and Professors Daniel Ritchie, Stefanie Tellex, and James Tompkin of Brown CS have just received Seed Awards from Brown’s Office of the Vice President for Research (OVPR) to help them compete more successfully for large-scale, interdisciplinary, multi-investigator grants. They join numerous previous Brown CS recipients of OVPR Seed Awards, including (most recently) Ian Gonsher, Jeff Huang, and Stefanie Tellex.
Carsten Eickhoff
"Delirium is common after acute stroke," Carsten says, "and likely represents an impediment to recovery. However, the concrete manifestations of delirium comprise a spectrum, and it is unclear whether various patterns of symptoms may have differential effects on outcomes."
Many of these symptoms, he says, are intimately connected, including arousal, attention, and activity level, and as a result, delirium phenotypes have been traditionally labeled as hyperactive, hypoactive, and mixed. Unfortunately, patients with hypoactive delirium are known to be underdiagnosed using standard screening tools, and the presence of pre-existing neurological symptoms only magnifies this challenge.
In his research, Carsten proposes an innovative approach aimed at diagnosing and categorizing delirium using wearable sensors capable of measuring activity on a granular scale. Activity data will then be analyzed using machine learning techniques to identify delirium phenotypes corresponding to patient activity patterns. He hypothesizes that such patterns may also be predictive of early motor recovery after stroke, and proposes to apply similar machine learning techniques to identify activity-based phenotypes corresponding to post-stroke functional outcomes.
Daniel Ritchie
"People spend a large percentage of their lives indoors," Daniel explains, "in bedrooms, living rooms, offices, kitchens, etc. The demand for virtual versions of these spaces has never been higher, with virtual reality, augmented reality, online furniture retail, computer vision, and robotics applications all requiring high-fidelity virtual environments."
To be truly compelling, he says, a virtual interior space must support the same interactions as its real-world counterpart: VR users expect to interact with the scene around them, and interaction with the surrounding environment is crucial for training autonomous robots (e.g. opening doors and cabinets). Most object interactions are characterized by the way the object's parts move or articulate. Unfortunately, it's difficult to create interactive scenes at the scale demanded by the applications above because there do not exist enough articulated 3D object models. Large static object databases exist, but the few existing articulated shape databases are several orders of magnitude smaller.
Daniel intends to address this critical need by creating a large dataset of articulated 3D object models: that is, each model in the dataset has a type and a range of motion annotated for each of its movable parts. This dataset will be of the same order of magnitude as the largest existing static shape databases. Hr plans to accomplish the goal by aggregating 3D models from existing static shape databases and then annotating them with part articulations, conducting the annotation process at scale using crowdsourcing tools (such as Amazon Mechanical Turk) by developing an easy-to-use, web-based annotation interface.
James Tompkin and Stefanie Tellex
"Teleoperation is an important means of robot control," James and Stefanie say, "with virtual reality (VR) teleoperation being a promising avenue for immersive control or ‘first-person’ view control. VR teleoperation is also especially promising for teaching robots how to learn from demonstration, as it enables a human to control robotic arm end effectors via VR wands to demonstrate how to conduct a task."
However, for the sense of sight, they explain that there's often a large difference between the freedom of view movement afforded to the human operator by the VR headset tracking system and the freedom of view movement afforded by the camera system: the robot typically has one or two cameras mounted on slowly-moving articulated heads or limbs, whereas the human’s head-mounted VR display provides rotation, binocular stereo, and motion parallax with very fast head pose changes (six degree of freedom, or ‘6DoF’). In effect, the robot is a camera operator trying to mimic the movements of the human to always match the desired view onto the scene. Even if the robot is mobile and articulated, it can rarely ‘keep up’ with the human’s fast motion and show the correct view to the VR headset. This mismatch makes it very easy to induce VR sickness, which limits comfort and teleoperation duration.
Their research will attempt to use deep learning methods to generate photorealistic image synthesis methods. These will adapt the fixed camera views to the human's current VR view by understanding the scene geometry and plausibly filling in any view discrepancies. It also aims to be fast to finally keep up with the human and improve teleoperation quality and reduce sickness. This will extend Brown's ROS Reality open source package for Unity-based VR robotic teleoperation.
Every year, Brown University's Graduate School recognizes four students who are receiving doctoral degrees for superior achievements in research: one each in the humanities, life sciences, physical sciences, and social sciences. This year, one of the recipients of the Joukowsky Family Foundation Outstanding Dissertation Award is Evgenios Kornaropoulos of Brown CS, who successfully defended his thesis two weeks ago. He is the Department of Computer Science's second winner of this prestigious award, following Stefan Roth. The award and an honorarium will be given out at the Graduate School Commencement ceremony on Sunday, May 26.
"As the volume and complexity of generated data grow," Evgenios explains, "users would like to maintain the ability to issue expressive queries on their data without sacrificing privacy. Encrypted databases are one of the most promising approaches towards this direction. However, this efficiency comes with the price of leaking information about the plaintext data. In my thesis, we use an algorithmic approach to develop rigorous attacks on encrypted databases and secure protocols." 
Specifically, Evgenios's work addresses the limitation of standard leakage profiles in encrypted databases under widely-used expressive queries such as range queries and k-nearest neighbor queries. "In the works published from my thesis," he says, "we show that even though we have cryptographic proofs that guarantee that the interaction between a client and a server leaks nothing more than a well-defined piece of information, we are still discovering what an adversary can infer from the leaked information. Using a plethora of algorithmic tools from areas such as computational geometry, statistics, learning theory, probabilistic analysis, and optimization, we devise new attacks that recover the plaintext values of encrypted databases under minimal assumptions about the query and the data distribution. Hopefully, our findings will pave the way towards new efficient cryptographic designs that defend against our attacks." 
When asked about the experience of doing a PhD at Brown CS, Evgenios says, "I am thrilled to call Prof. Roberto Tamassia my academic father. His experience, rigor, and patience helped me sharpen my technical skills as well as my research taste. I also feel very fortunate to interact frequently with our professors that lead by example such as Prof. Vasileios Kemerlis and the rest of our Security Group. Finally, a big part of my thesis came out of my interaction with my academic sibling Prof. Charalampos Papamanthou from University of Maryland who is doing outstanding research and always sets the bar high. It is an honor to receive this prestigious award from our Graduate School and I am thankful for our professors and staff for making my graduate studies such a rewarding experience!"

As the academic year drew to a close, Brown CS held its annual Undergraduate Computer Science Research Symposium on May 2, 2019, organized by Professors Jeff Huang and Stefanie Tellex and Meta-URAs Mary Dong, Marshall Lerner, and Alan Yu. Now in its fifth year, the event features presentations of student research with the goal of showcasing cutting-edge work and encouraging other undergraduates to undertake research projects of their own.
Out of more than two dozen participants, the winners were:
Overall #1: Atsunobu Kotani ("Writing Robot")
"Atsunobi's work with Stefanie is about writing robots. The idea is to show the image of already drawn handwriting characters to the robot, and it will immediately infer a drawing policy to reproduce the image, while preserving details such as stroke orders and continuity. He also had a second project about handwriting synthesis. Imagine that you are asked to write 'hello' in your handwriting. The model Atsunobi trained can predict how you would write other words such as 'world' in your handwriting style, without ever asking you to write the characters."
Overall #2: Alex Jang ("Phonologically Informed Low-Resource Speech Recognition for Foreign Accents")
"Traditionally, dealing with foreign accents in automatic speech recognition (ASR) requires training data from speakers with each accent, which can be expensive to collect, take up lots of memory to store, and require lots of time to process. Instead, by using phonology to inform a model, we can remove the need for foreign accented training data, using only data from native English speakers."
Overall #3: Rohin Bhushan, Nathaniel Weir, and Shekar Ramaswamy ("DBPal")
"The team presents DBPal, a novel data exploration tool with a natural language interface. DBPal uses a deep model to translate natural language statements to SQL, making the translation process more robust to paraphrasing and other linguistic variations."
People’s Choice: Alexander Chase ("Examining Lexical Differences In South America")
"With the rise of massive amounts of easily accessible data, linguistics is shifting from a social science to a data science. Alexander is intrigued by this concept, and this project is an exploration into how data science can be applied to visualize how language is being used. He aims to build upon past research done in Spanish linguistics to provide a unique perspective of the language variation in South America."
A total of $2,000 in prizes was generously donated by Mitsubishi and Amazon Robotics.

Professor Josh Tenenbaum of MIT visited Brown CS last month to deliver the thirty-eighth lecture ("Building Machines That Learn And Think Like People") in the Distinguished Lecture Series.
After an introduction by Brown CS Professor Daniel Ritchie, who hosted the lecture, Tenenbaum moved quickly to the central theme of his talk, saying that we have artificial intelligence technologies "but no artificial intelligence, no flexible, general-purpose common sense". The challenge for scientists, he said, is to "reverse-engineer how intelligence works" in the human brain, and despite all our advances, we have yet to create artificial intelligence that can match the model-building abilities of an eighteen-month-old child.
Inspired by human cognitive development, which he called "the only known scaling path to intelligence that actually works," Tenenbaum explained his belief that the goal of artificial intelligence isn't mere pattern recognition but to grow into sophisticated behaviors (understanding what we see, explaining it, imagining the unseen, making plans) through small steps. A large crowd that more than filled CIT 368 listened as he walked through some of the tools he's employed in the pursuit of machines that learn and think like people: a bi-directional loop of CS and engineering to "reverse-engineer the common-sense core," probabilistic programming to create an intuitive psychics engine, and work with psychologists to understand social interactions.
"The child is the ultimate coder," he said, "and learning is programming the game engine of your life....The goal of learning is to make your code more awesome." 
Afterward, we caught up with Professor Ellie Pavlick of Brown CS, who attended the talk, and she highlighted Josh's eagerness to tackle difficult problems as well as his unorthodox perspective. "I think the point that Josh hit on at the end –the question 'what do we build in versus what do we learn from scratch'– is possibly the biggest question right now in AI and cognitive science," she says. "Deep learning, taken as a whole, is often seen as representing the 'build nothing, learn everything' stance. Josh’s work exemplifies something closer to the other side, where learning happens on top of a foundation of existing structured knowledge about the world. I’ve never met anyone who doesn’t know and admire the work Josh is doing. It’s theoretically well motivated and the empirical results are impressive."
"I'm very honored to be receiving this award," says R. Iris Bahar, Professor of Engineering and Computer Science at Brown University, upon hearing that she's just won the Marie R. Pistilli Women in Electronic Design Award. "I'm passionate about helping to support and promote women in electronic design automation, and in computing more generally." 
Given annually since 2000 by the Design Automation Conference (DAC), the award, which is named for a former DAC organizer, recognizes individuals who have visibly helped to advance women in the field of electronic design. In the official press release, the conference's organizers cite contributions by Iris that are "as impactful as they are diverse" as well as her numerous papers and citations, and name her one of the pioneers in identifying power consumption as the premier constraint for computer architects and system designers.
“Iris has walked and bridged the boundary between electronic design and computer architecture and has become a leader in both fields," says Diana Marculescu, David Edward Schramm Professor and past Marie R. Pistilli Award winner. "Given Iris’ technical contributions to the field of EDA and her dedication to the goal of advancing the status of women in electronic design, I cannot think of a more deserving recipient."
For Iris, advancing women in computing has included high school outreach, innovative course development, dedicated efforts to include female students in her research, and organizing as well as speaking at career development workshops. And the work continues.
"When I attend conferences in my research area," she says, "I usually find women make up only around 10-15% of the total number of attendees. I would like to see this number grow significantly in the near term, which means continuing to help females, from high school to long-time professionals, feel welcomed, recognized, and valued in in the greater computing community (including both academia and industry). I'm excited to continue my efforts in the years to come."
Iris will receive the award during the 56th DAC, which will be held from June 2-6, 2019, in Las Vegas.

Doug Woos sees some of the rationale for his interest in academia originating with his passion for moral and political philosophy. "The best attitude for a philosophy class," he says, "is to read a text and buy into it for the entire duration, accepting that it's correct throughout. Then, when you're done, ask what the problems were. Taking that step of really buying in is so important: starting with a critique when reading a research paper or studying a new subject can be a huge mistake." 
Doug is joining Brown CS as lecturer next semester (he's one of the first hires in the landmark CS With Impact expansion), and his ability to immerse himself in a subject and suspend critique may stem from hours upon hours spent among the ever-new planets and cultures of science fiction. "I was obsessed with SF as a kid," says Doug, remembering a family basement filled with classics: Clarke, Heinlein, Asimov, Dick, and the eccentric but visionary Cordwainer Smith. "I don't know where I'd be without it."
His first exposure to computer science came early. The son of a programmer, Doug learned Python at age eleven or twelve and worked for his father in middle school, enjoying himself but not expecting to make it a career. As an undergraduate at Swarthmore College, he took computer science classes to avoid atrophy of his programming skills, but his initial plans were to major in physics.
But research with Professor Tia Newhall, Doug's undergraduate advisor, changed his mind. Initial projects with memory allocation in Linux clusters were followed by graduate work at University of Pennsylvania with formal verification and programming languages. "I was still interested in systems," he says, "but I wanted to apply PL tools and techniques."
Doug's interests are unabashedly broad: "CS is such a young field, and it wasn't that many years ago when systems wasn't a separate area from programming languages or artificial intelligence. We've divided ourselves semi-artificially, and I'm skeptical that all of the divisions are useful. I think it pays to be interested in a really broad swath of computer science."
And his recent research, he explains, was directly by inspired by his teaching. Already interested in formally verifying the safety properties of distributed systems ("Verdi: A Framework for Implementing and Verifying Distributed Systems"), he noticed that students in his Distributed Systems class were having a difficult time debugging their work. This led to his current project, Oddity, a graphical debugger for distributed systems.  
"It was a great example of what I love about academia," Doug says. "Seeing students thinking about interesting problems, really understanding the material, and asking questions that you can't answer."
In just a few months, he'll be standing up in front of those students, and Doug says he's excited by courses like Tim Nelson's CSCI 1950-Y Logic for Systems and the new sequence of Brown CS introductory courses: "I'd love to help develop the new sequence, and to teach broadly about programming languages, systems, OSes, or compilers."
Or possibly formal methods or verification, he says, explaining that he envisions them growing in prominence in the days ahead. What does he see in the crystal ball? "From my perspective as someone who likes applying PL techniques to systems," he laughs, "more of that!" 
Giving the examples of Amazon Web Services and Oracle, Doug says that he sees widespread application of at least lightweight formal methods techniques to distributed systems. "These systems are so big and so complex," he says, "that you find bugs at very surprising levels. We need to understand these systems not just at the level of a diagram on a whiteboard: we need an FM understanding. As we use certain languages more and more, we can only avoid some really serious security vulnerabilities by having language-level guarantees of correctness."
As we wind down our conversation with Doug, we move through science fiction and philosophy to arrive at another of his great loves, coffee. ("I'm drinking it during this conversation," he notes.) A bit spoiled by the world-class scene in Seattle, he notes that Providence has some "pretty tasty" beans of its own that he's ready to put to use.
And he's eager to get started at Brown CS: "I really can't wait. Brown just jumped out at me because of the impressive commitment to undergraduate education. Everyone, even people who are focused on research, are passionately involved in what the undergraduate curriculum is like. I had a huge number of amazing conversations with faculty and students when I was in Providence, and I'm looking forward to more."
Brown CS has just announced that it will recognize 27 graduating seniors for their achievements at Commencement in May. Michael Ball, Laura Blackstone, Isaiah Brand, Leslie Bresnahan, Jonathan Chemburkar, Joshua Chipman, Loudon Cohen, Grant Fong, Montana Fowler, Alex Fratila, Purvi Goel, Mae Heitmann, Elaine Jiang, Atsunobu Kotani, Zach Kirschenbaum, Benjamin Murphy, Shivam Nadimpalli, Nina Polshakova, Silei Ren, Lucas Rosenblatt, Josh Roy, Sumit Sohani, Chantal Toupin, Chinenye Uduji, Nathan Umbanhowar, Nathaniel Weir, and Alan Yu will each receive the Senior Prize in Computer Science for their academic work as well as their service to Brown CS. It's the largest number of Senior Prizes ever awarded in one year, reflecting both the increased size of the department and the many contributions of these individuals.
"These are our top students," says Associate Professor (Research) and Vice Chair Tom Doeppner. "As a group, they've done superior work, but we were also very impressed with how generously they were able to give back to the department and their fellow students." 
Montana Fowler will be starting a PhD program at UC Santa Cruz in the Computational Media department. "I discovered my passion for teaching in the Undergraduate TA program at Brown and my passion for research in Daniel Ritchie’s lab," she says. "It’s thanks to Brown’s encouragement for undergraduates to be involved in the department that I discovered my dream to become a professor."
"Brown Computer Science has been everything I could have asked for in an undergraduate education," says Benjamin Murphy. "I’ve gotten to take challenging classes in topics from theory to systems, and have gained a great deal of experience in industry. I’m honored to have won the prize, and to have had the opportunity to give back towards the department even a small portion of what I’ve gained – the department uniquely values undergraduates, and the teaching I’ve received from my peers contributed an incalculable amount to my education. Brown has also given me the confidence to explore outside of computer science, and consequently I will be heading to Google for a couple years after graduation, before matriculating at Harvard Law School to study privacy law."
Isaiah Brand tells us that he's always felt that teaching is instrumental to learning, and Brown CS has consistently enabled him to tutor and collaborate with other students. “I feel incredibly lucky to have been able to design and help teach a robotics course as an undergrad," he says. "Where could an undergrad design a course that has every student build a drone?”
"Robotics is no longer primarily a hardware problem, but largely one of software," says Professor George Konidaris of Brown CS. "We already have highly physically capable robots, but our ability to program them is still quite limited. Ideally, we’d like to be able to give the robot a what goal (e.g. the light should be switched on), and have the robot figure the how part of the problem out itself. But we’re a long way from that, and a major reason why is that we don’t know how to get away from the plethora of tiny low-level details a robot has to deal with –every pixel, and every motor signal– to the kinds of high-level planning at which humans excel."
Konidaris’s recent work has been focused on the theoretical foundations of the problem of abstraction, and last year he published a paper that introduced a new theoretical framework for helping robots learn to reason abstractly. “That work felt like a great step,” says George, “but it wasn’t yet really practical, because the robot must learn every aspect of every new task from scratch.”
Earlier this month, George won a National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER Award that will help him tackle that challenge by applying his new theoretical framework to the problem of designing robots that view the world in an object-centric way: they will learn to manipulate objects, build abstract internal representations of those objects, and reuse these representations to generalize across similar objects. His aim is to build the foundation for a new family of algorithms that will enable robots to reason and plan in complex scenarios in the real world by getting the most mileage out of the learning they’ve already done.
CAREER Awards are given in support of outstanding junior faculty teacher-scholars who excel at research, education, and integration of the two within the context of an organizational mission, and George joins multiple previous Brown CS winners of the award, including (most recently) Theophilus Benson, Stefanie Tellex, Jeff Huang, and Rodrigo Fonseca.
On March 21, team Brown Secure '19, composed of Brown CS students Nicole Cheng, Manuel Gorotiza, Willem Speckmann, and Angela Zhuo, and coached by Professor John Savage, competed in the seventh annual Atlantic Council Cyber 9/12 Strategy Challenge in Washington, DC. The event featured a record-setting 47 teams from institutions across the country and was designed to give students a taste of the challenges that face White House policy makers when responding to national cybersecurity threats. This is John's sixth year of participating in the competition, and his previous teams were winners of first place in 2015 and a prize for Best Teamwork in 2014.
The competition began weeks in advance, when the students prepared a decision document, operating as if they were members of the National Security Council staff. This year's cybersecurity threat involved both software and hardware vulnerabilities at the United States Census Bureau, and the team proposed multiple policy recommendations, including the creation of a task force and the declaration of a national emergency in order to make additional funds available and require intelligence services to assess the extent of foreign interference.
On the morning of March 21, teams had ten minutes to present their ideas orally, took questions for ten minutes, recessed, and then returned for feedback. Judges included a wide selection of individuals from both the public and private sector. During lunch, students attended presentations and career panels led by experts from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, the Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security, the US Department of Homeland Security, and other organizations.
That evening, the teams were hosted by the Baker & McKenzie global law firm at their offices on Connecticut Avenue, overlooking Lafayette Park and the White House. Speakers included David Lashway (Co-chair of the Global Cybersecurity Practice and Partner at Baker & McKenzie), Barry Pavel (Senior Vice President, Arnold Kanter Chair, and Director of the Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security at the Atlantic Council), and Christopher Krebs (Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency at the US Department of Homeland Security.  
This year, Brown's team wasn't among the qualifiers for the next round, so they spent their second day touring the city, including a visit to the Air and Space Museum. Nevertheless, John is very proud of their hard work.
"The competition was fierce," he says, "and I was really pleased with our team's solutions. One of the judges questioned whether a national emergency was necessary, but given the unprecedented nature of the threat, I don't think it's an unreasonable solution. The students were very well prepared, they presented well, and I'm glad they had the opportunity to meet some true experts and hear about cutting-edge developments in the field."

“There are a lot of aspects of language that are really complex and humans are really good at picking up on those nuances, and machines are really not,” says Brown CS Professor Ellie Pavlick. “I love working on [something] so fundamentally human and so complex.”
In a recent essay, ("Nothing Ventured, Nothing Gained") undergraduate Liyaan Maskati interviews Ellie about the complexities and nuances of Pavlick's entry into computer science, diverse interests, and even the relationship between music and math. It's a wide-ranging piece that she organizes thematically, opening each section with the literal and figurative definitions of various international proverbs, and it won her First Place in the Undergraduate category of the Association for Women In Mathematics (AWM) Student Essay Contest.
To increase awareness of women’s ongoing contributions to the mathematical sciences, AWM and Math for America co-sponsor an essay contest for biographies of contemporary women mathematicians and statisticians in academic, industrial, and government careers. This year, they received 307 entries across the three categories (Grades 6-8, Grades 9-12, and Undergraduate) from 46 states, the District of Columbia, and three other countries.
In the current day and age, self-driving cars are perhaps one of the most promising technologies on the horizon. With the potential to dramatically improve traffic planning, fuel efficiency, and productivity, it’s easy to understand the excitement surrounding this innovation. One of the largest challenges facing the field, however, is safety. Brown CS alums Jacob Beck ‘18 and Zoe Papakipos ‘18 have eagerly taken up this challenge. Currently working at Microsoft Research and Facebook AI Research respectively, the duo’s research on the training of autonomous driving software has recently been recognized in New Scientist, one of the leading publications recognizing those at the cutting edge of technological progress.
What exactly does the research entail? “Autonomous vehicle research is about making computers drive cars,” remarks Jake, “and it’s important because computers have a fast reaction time, infinite attention, and are consistent. The focus of our work is to do this in a scalable way by teaching the computers from real world examples.” Currently, one common way to teach autonomous vehicles to drive is to train the AI off hours of footage of human driving that is deemed to depict perfect behavior. The problem with this approach, however, is that it restricts the software to only one side of the spectrum. It learns all about good driving, but it doesn’t get exposure to poor driving and the dangerous states it brings about. The car would have no idea what to do in a “bad state”, hindering its response in the real world.  
“One alternative to this approach is a hybrid version of reinforcement learning – having a human driver try actions, and telling the computer how good or bad each action was,” says Zoe. The team recorded a human driving well, but also showed examples of swerving and erratic driving, and a backseat driver labelled the driving as positive or negative. The software then used this information to drive the car itself, and performed over 1.5 times better than the behavioral cloning method with perfect driving behavior. The research clearly showed a marked improvement over prior approaches, but this new approach also came with its own set of challenges.
“It was really difficult giving good feedback to the car,” explains Jake, “it’s really hard to know the exact angle for the steering wheel without turning the car yourself.” Eventually, the pair overcame this problem by having a human labeller turn the wheel to show approximately how much the car should change its action. For example, if the car should be turning a little bit more to the left, the human labeller turns the wheel slightly to the left. If the car is turning sharply left off the road, the labeller turns the wheel considerably further to the right.
Having made such an impact so early on their careers, what do they think made it possible for them to achieve so much so quickly? “It all really began in Professor Michael Littman’s autonomous driving lab at Brown,” explains Zoe, “and we were really interested in the applications of machine learning.” “It’s pretty amazing how willing to help professors are at Brown,” adds Jake, “and my work in the lab really prepared me well.” Although the pair have made much progress in the field, there is clearly much work to be done. “It feels really great, being recognized for a project that we were both so interested in,” laughs Zoe, “but we definitely need to put more work on it to be conference ready. The core ideas are there.” There’s no doubt that the duo’s research may prove to be vitally important to this exciting field, and the possibilities are endless.  
"Even today," says Diba Mirza, faculty in Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), "there is a prevailing assumption that only graduate students are qualified to work as Teaching Assistants in undergraduate courses. Brown CS proves that assumption wrong, and that was very interesting to us."
Diba joined UCSB in 2017, and one of her first tasks was to develop their Computer Science Undergraduate Tutor (UT) Program. Previously, she explains, only graduate students served as teaching assistants, and her department was looking to create a model that allowed undergraduates to take part as well. After a pilot with six UTs in 2017, the program doubled in size the following semester, and now includes more than thirty tutors. Hoping for more growth, and inspired by the Brown CS UTA program (Professor Andy van Dam of Brown CS is a member of the UCSB Department of Computer Science's Advisory Board), Diba came to Providence last summer to learn more, meeting with students, UTAs, Andy, and other faculty members.
"Andy started the UTA program at Brown CS in the 1960s, and amazingly, he's still part of it," Diba says. "That's so rare! It's a huge learning opportunity, and I really wanted to benefit from all those years of experience."
UCSB has more than 450 undergraduate students majoring on Computer Science, she explains, with another 200 or more in Computer Engineering. Much like at Brown, interest in CS courses is increasing exponentially, with strong demand even from students who don't intend to major in the subject, but one key difference is that certain introductory courses have an attendance cap, restricting their enrollment.
"We want to grow our program, Diba says, "but it's a complicated, campus-level discussion about what undergraduates can and can't do. We had a lot of faculty and student support, so I came to Brown to see what might be involved to scale our program and what mechanisms would allow it to scale successfully."
One of the key points that Diba took away from the visit was the use of different roles within the program: UTAs, Head TAs, and Meta TAs. "All of them were so deeply engaged," she says. "I asked them how they run labs, how they train other TAs, and I could see the care and attention. They had been very carefully selected and they were really able to take charge without constant supervision, with a real sense of ownership. For instance, I was very interested to find out how involved the HTAs are with interviewing. Even if we don't emulate this exact model at UCSB, it's definitely going to inform what we do."
Diba was also impressed by the week of intense training that helps prepare UTAs just before the semester begins. UCSB's tutors are required to take a "Teaching Computer Science" course but she believes there's a lot to be gained from having at least some of the content delivered as Brown CS does, from students to students. Diba says that she also appreciates the close attention from faculty: "I was fortunate to hear Andy's signature address to his UTAs, in which he not only sets expectations but also explores themes of professionalism and empathy in a way that freshmen can relate to. Other faculty I spoke to support the program wholeheartedly, but I like how they keep a critical eye, making sure that students don't overwork themselves, and maintain the right balance of ownership for the course."    
According to Diba, one of the greatest similarities between UCSB and Brown CS is student enthusiasm for helping their peers: "Our students are very excited about making an impact and improving the experience of students that follow after them." And the focus, she maintains, is much larger than a single course or even a single degree.
"It's about mentorship with lasting impact," she says. "First, you have a terrific educator like Andy mentoring the HTAs, and that continues from the HTAs to the UTAs, and then to the students. It's true professional development: for example, if they go on to grad school, they've learned to do the kind of meticulous, error-free work that matters when working with a faculty member. We're really trying to help our students succeed not just in the short term but over many years." 
At this point, Diba says, UCSB is close to being able to expand the use of Undergraduate Tutors across a series of first-year courses taught by multiple instructors. "We're looking to scale," she says, "and Brown CS has been a great inspiration for how to run a very beneficial program at a very large scale.  Ultimately, we hope that any of our courses that would like to include UTs should be able to include them. That's our goal."
“The 90’s were a really interesting time to be a computer science undergraduate,” laughs Brown CS alum Michael Horn ‘97, as he remembers his earlier years at the University. “The web was just beginning to come into its own and the entire field was progressing at lightning pace, it certainly was an extraordinarily exciting time.” The field has advanced far beyond those early days of computing, but Michael remains at the forefront of cutting-edge research in the subject. Currently a professor in the Learning Sciences and Computer Science Department at Northwestern University, with a primary focus on Human Computer Interaction, his work has continued to make an impact on generations of students.
When Michael first began his career, his ambitions were as far from academia  as one can imagine. Like so many other CS students, he took a software engineering job in San Francisco doing business, task management, and software on mobile devices. But Michael soon realized that this line of work wasn’t for him. “I got sick of it pretty quickly,” he remarks, “and I knew I really loved learning.” This realization led Michael to Classroom Connect, which was an online curriculum company selling learning products to states and school districts. But after 5 years, Michael knew that this line of work still wasn’t for him. “I really felt that it was too tech driven, we were selling these learning products but I had no idea how they were actually being used by students. There was just a lack of incentive to explore the bigger questions that were difficult to make profitable.” With such an approach, Michael knew that graduate school would be his best route moving forward.
“I started looking into grad schools, specifically working in human computer interaction, but it was difficult finding a grad school that would take me,” remembers Michael. Fortunately, Michael was able to earn admission into the PhD program at Tufts, working in Human Computer Interaction, precisely what his aims had been. With work ranging from the development of exhibits at the Boston Museum of Science and involvement with the Child Development Project, Michael finally realized where his passions lay. Academia was truly the best avenue to continue making an impact on the field, while satisfying a lifelong love of learning.
Driven by a passion for learning, Michael made the decision to stay in the field of academia following his graduate years. This decision, however, did not come without its own set of challenges. He was offered a newly created position at Northwestern, with a joint appointment in the the departments of Computer Science and the Learning Sciences. “I didn’t have a formal background,” he explains, “and this was really a brand new field.” But Michael quickly found his home in this unique intersection, as he dived into the field of learning sciences. “I gradually began understanding the theoretical foundation of how people learn,” he remarks, “and this was really important for HCI. We were kind of inventing this field, which is really difficult to work on.” Beginning with work on tangible programming languages in kindergarten classrooms and science museums, Michael’s projects have expanded into a diverse range of fields with a focus on the thoughtful uses of emerging technologies in diverse learning settings.
With such a diverse and impactful career, what would Michael say best prepared him for his eventual path? “It was definitely the undergraduate TA program,” he says. “There really is just a culture of undergrads having the freedom to run the show. It was amazing to see people care so much about learning and education.” This love of learning certainly remains with Michael to this day, as he continues working on advancing this field.
"The Bootstrap curriculum stands out from the numerous computer science and computational thinking curricula that have cropped up in recent years," says Thea Charles, Head of Knowledge and Impact at Siegel Family Endowment (SFE), which is making a gift to support the K-12 CS curriculum directed by Kathi Fisler, Shriram Krishnamurthi, and Emmanuel Schanzer of Brown CS.
The project is a natural fit for SFE, which supports people who do work at the intersection of learning, workforce, and infrastructure, and champions organizations whose work contributes to making a world in which all people have the tools, skills, and context necessary to engage meaningfully in a rapidly changing society. Bootstrap, now reaching about 25,000 students each year (approximately forty-three percent are girls and forty-six percent are minorities), will be using SFE's support for general operation and to grow capacity. It's a promising start to the year for the organization, which recently joined a national coalition of educational groups to create comprehensive K-12 CS pathways and was praised as being part of a "wave of the future" by Internet pioneer Vint Cerf.
"The members of the Bootstrap team are leaders in the field," says Charles, "and their expertise and commitment have helped so many teachers incorporate computational thinking to their curricula in a way that is both creative and backed by research. We're eager to keep learning from them."
In the days since we went to press with the story below, Brown CS alums Dave Simons ’90 and Daniel Wilk ’92 have won yet another award for their work on Adobe Character Animator. The National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences has recognized the tool as a Pioneering System for Live Performance-Based Animation Using Facial Recognition. Developed by Dave’s team, Character Animator allows artists to animate characters in real time via live tracking and has changed the landscape of character animation. “We are honored to work on software that allows artists to tell their stories in new ways,” says Dave when asked about his motivations for the project. The tool was used for the first-ever live episode of The Simpsons, live cartoon interviews on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, and the quick-turnaround production of Our Cartoon President, and will undoubtedly continue to make waves in the animation industry.
“We knew the odds were against us,” laughs Brown CS alum Dave Simons ’90, “but the idealism of four recent college graduates trumped the 90% failure rate we were warned about.” Nearly 30 years later, it seems this idealism may not have been misplaced, as Dave, along with fellow Brown CS alums Daniel Wilk ’92 and Michael Natkin ’89, have just won an Academy Award in scientific and technical achievement for their work on Adobe After Effects. Awarded to those who provide extraordinary contributions to the science of filmmaking and a proven record of contributing significant value to the process of making motion pictures, the honor truly recognized the critical role that After Effects has come to play in the motion graphics industry.
What motivated Dave to begin his work on this pioneering project? Well, it all started in the graphics group of Brown CS Professor Andy van Dam many years ago, at a time when undergraduate contributions to research were far less common. (Michael also mentioned both Andy and his group in his acceptance speech, thanking van Dam for "giving me a chance" and a first introduction to graphics.) “When I first began my work in this field, all the tools were command-line tools,” explains Dave, “and I actually did my senior thesis on distribution ray-tracing.” Friendships at Brown naturally led to the birth of The Company of Science & Art, otherwise known as CoSA for short. Founded by Dave and three other Brown graduates in June of 1990 –Greg Deocampo ’88, David Foster (DaveF) ’90, and David Herbstman (DaveH) ’90– the company planned to become the next world-class content provider for the new electronic age. “After searching all around Providence, DaveF found a great place near downtown,” he remembers. “DaveH negotiated the rent down to $1000 a month, and we were in business.”
With such lofty expectations, it was no surprise that the fledgling company inevitably faced a myriad of setbacks in its early years. The original plan was to have artists and programmers working side by side to produce multimedia content, and CD-ROM production was the first task. Named Connections: The CoSA Journal, this first hypermedia publication was designed to show off the new medium, but garnered little interest. This was followed by PACo (PICS Animation Compiler), which allowed platform-independent low-bandwidth streaming animation playback with synched sound. What initially seemed like a promising idea, however, quickly changed as Apple announced QuickTime a mere few months later. Running low on funds, the team knew that they needed to come up with something fast. And it was from this that Egg (the first codename for After Effects) was born. This is where Dave’s graphics-group training would really start to pay off.
With Egg development in full swing, it was at this point that Dan Wilk ’92 joined the team, helping to write effect plug-ins. The first press demos of the brand-new software were held in a private suite at MacWorld Boston. After receiving positive reviews from the public, the team quickly realized that the project needed a real name – After Effects.
“Showing After Effects 1.0 to the public for the first time was an exhilarating experience,” remembers Dave, “We had a tiny booth and people were packed ten-deep at times trying to get a glimpse.” The software exploded in popularity, and CoSA was bought out a mere six months later by Aldus Corporation, followed by another merger of Aldus into Adobe Systems a year later. This set into motion the chain of events that led to After Effects becoming the dominant motion graphics and visual effects application used in the post-production process of film and television production.
“It’s easily the most common tool now to do motion graphics in the film industry,” explains Dave, “and it really lets you create anything you want in this field.” Brown CS has certainly left its mark on the industry, as over 15 Brown graduates worked at CoSA or were involved in the After Effects project. Used for most of the iconic Pixar movies’ opening and closing credits, After Effects has quickly become an indispensable tool in the artist’s toolkit.
With such an accomplished career, what does Dave believe prepared him best from his years at Brown? Well, it may very well have been his experiences TAing a myriad of classes in Brown CS. “I was a head TA for Andy van Dam in CS 11 and CS 192,” he remembers, “and Andy’s high bar and criticalness made me learn a lot.” Dave has certainly come a long way from the old, refurbished apartment in which the project first began, and his work has undoubtedly made it possible for countless artists to enable their dreams.

The Randy F. Pausch '82 Computer Science Undergraduate Summer Research Award, given this year to Evan Cater to support his work with Brown CS Professor Michael Littman, recognizes strong achievement from young students and offers them the opportunity to partner with faculty and advance work that began in the  undergraduate research program.
A generous gift from Peter Norvig '78 (a Director of Research at Google and a thought leader in the areas of artificial intelligence, natural language processing, information retrieval, and software engineering) established the award, which provides $10,000 annually to support an undergraduate engaged in an intensive faculty-student summer research partnership. The gift honors the life and work of Randy F. Pausch '82, a renowned expert in computer science, human-computer interaction, and design who died of complications from pancreatic cancer in 2008. "His story is inspiring," Peter says, "and this is an opportunity to remember him."
Evan explains that he began collaborating with Michael as a first-year student, working alongside a Master's student on Variational Autoencoders with Deep Q-Networks, a type of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. "We couldn't get the idea working," he says, "and the project fizzled out, but it piqued my interest in both RL and Variational Inference. I've revisited these ideas in conjunction over the past couple of years, and this proposal and research project will hopefully synthesize my thoughts on the subject."
And what might that look like? First, some background.
"Any time we have robotics or computer programs interacting with the real world," Evan says, "there exists a lot of uncertainty. When deploying a program that, for example, modulates the power grid, or a self-driving bus that carts children to school, a lot is at stake. Storms can impede driving, hard drives can fail, car accidents happen, and programs can seg-fault. When faced with uncertainty, we want to make sure our Artificial Intelligence can make decisions. The agents interact with the world over time, so we can formalize this problem as learning good policies (or actions) over time, under uncertainty."
To construct agents that operate under uncertainty, he says, it's necessary to categorize uncertainties. For example, epistemic uncertainty is created by a lack of data, whereas aleatoric uncertainty is the result of random changes in the environment.
"My work," Evan says, "is a research study on a unified view of uncertainty in Deep Reinforcement Learning. First, we'll provide a taxonomy and vocabulary to describe the various uncertainties used in reinforcement learning. Next, we'll compare and contrast different contemporary papers, clearly distinguishing the types of uncertainty each paper considers and how the papers interact. The study will also provide some theoretical comparisons between the types of uncertainty. Finally, we'll use the study to inform the design of a new set of algorithms based on the insights ascertained. My hypothesis is that techniques from Variational Inference can be used as a unifying tool for the competing techniques."
With the summer only months away, Evan tells us that he can't wait to explore, read, and tinker: "I'm ecstatic and really thankful to all the students and professors that got me here. I remember being a first-year student sitting in on Michael's lab meetings and catching every tenth word. Flustered, a couple of seniors and PhD students took me under their wings and pointed me in the right direction. I owe everything to those student mentors and Michael for nurturing me as a researcher. Michael has been helpful and understanding, supportive during the rough weeks, and he sparks creativity in all of his students. I often look forward to our exploratory debates and deep dives into 'what is really going on'." 
Evan's eagerness and excitement is exactly what Peter Norvig is looking for. He sees this award as a multiplier that will amplify the value of his gift and extend it through time. "In the past," he says, "we had to build all our own tools, and we didn't have time to combine computer science with other fields. Now, there are so many opportunities to do so. I think it's a wise choice: you invest in things that you think will do good, and educating a student allows them to help add to the things that you're already trying to accomplish." 
Integral to the success of Brown CS are the dedicated and hard-working staff members who show tireless commitment to improving the CS community. Recently, this effort was recognized when Communications Outreach Specialist Jesse Polhemus was awarded the 2018 Brown Excellence Award in Efficiency. This award recognizes the accomplishments of Brown staff members, and Jesse is one of the thirty-five honored this year. Nominated for his unwavering dedication to the department, Jesse was specifically highlighted for his work with alums for the UTA fundraising campaign.
Jesse, now in his fifth year at the University, fulfills a vital function for the team. In his current position, Jesse shares information and tells the stories of what makes Brown CS special, whether it’s innovative research, teaching excellence, or the tight-knit community of faculty and students.
What makes him a great fit for the job? Well, it may very well be the unique perspective and diverse set of skills that Jesse brings to the table. “I see myself as a craftsperson (my heroes are the Roycrofters, a community of makers from last century’s Arts and Crafts movement),” explains Jesse, “as someone who has worked hard to develop of set of skills and is trusted to use them with my mind and heart to produce meaningful work.”
What attracted Jesse to Brown in particular? “One of the things I like about working for Brown is that if you take five minutes to get to know someone, they have another interest, or even expertise, in something that isn’t immediately obvious,” he says. “I got a Master’s degree in Old English riddles and enigmata because I’m interested in how other people see the world, and I wanted to prove to myself that I had a solid understanding of something I care about.”
There may not be very many Old English specialists in the ranks of computer science communication departments, but Jesse has clearly proved that his unique perspective provides an invaluable asset to our community. Ranging from his work on Conduit (the annual Brown CS magazine), to our first-ever Faculty Handbook, to his work with alums for the UTA endowment campaign, Jesse’s accomplishments have left his mark on the program.
‘I’m still smiling about it,” laughs Jesse when asked about his recent win. “I’ve worked at private companies where awards were given out in response to low morale, and this is the exact opposite – I’m thrilled that the quality of my work is important to Brown.” With such a dedicated team, it’s no surprise that this award comes on the heels of numerous other honors for Brown CS staff. Most recently, Laura Dobler (Financial and Outreach Coordinator) was named an Office of Institutional Diversity and Inclusion Fellow and Lauren Clarke (Academic and IP Programs Manager) was awarded the Brown Excellence Award.
Since the earliest days of Brown, our students have been eager to combine the pursuit of societal change with rigorous academic study, then use what they’ve learned to benefit humankind at large. In today’s world, where computation has become ubiquitous, this obligation takes on new importance. Users of social media, owners of Internet-enabled appliances, and other inhabitants of the Big Data world are increasingly being confronted with the notion of responsibility for how they use technology or allow it to be used on their behalf.
Here at Brown CS, this responsibility requires acknowledging that computer science can’t be solely a technical issue, and that its use must go beyond profit-making to address the societal issues of the day. One recent example is our participation in the Swearer Center’s Engaged Scholars Program, which in the context of CS challenges students to consider the ethical implications and societal impact of emerging technologies. Another is our Industry Partners Program, which now offers complimentary memberships to nonprofits and organizations working in the social good sector.
Last year saw yet another example when a group of CS undergraduates formed a group called CS for Social Change with the realization that computation gave them the perfect tools to serve a greater good. Their interests found a common cause with Professor and Department Chair Ugur Çetintemel, and they worked with him over a period of months to create a new a course that debuted last semester: CSCI 1951-I CS for Social Change.
This pioneering course now takes its place in a group of classes that includes DATA 0080 Data, Ethics and Society, a course offered by Brown’s Data Science Initiative; CSCI 1870 Cybersecurity Ethics; and several CS courses that include modules on responsible use of CS. Together, we can think of them as a growing emphasis within the Brown CS curriculum that demonstrates computer science’s potential to bring about greater social awareness and societal good. We’ll examine each course in more depth below and devote a series of future articles to the other programs above.
CSCI 1951-I CS for Social Change
“Even before many of us came to Brown,” says Head TA Nikita Ramoji, “we were thinking about the societal impact of CS. Software is very naturalized in the Western world, and it has the potential for reaching all levels of society equally.” Together with student Elaine Jiang, she started coming up with ideas for material that would unite computer science and social good soon after arriving in Providence.
Initially, Nikita and Elaine had thought that the content might work well as an extracurricular activity. But after talking to Brown seniors, the two students found that many of them wanted to be involved with social change but hadn’t found a clear avenue to pursue it. Many students who were anticipating careers in industry explained that if they had learned more about the societal impact of computer science, they might have chosen a different path.
And so they decided to approach Ugur, offering their assistance with material that he’d been working on for some time. The result was a course with student input at every level, from the syllabus to the assignments. “We didn’t know how things would work out,” Nikita says, “but Brown students are passionate about causes, and they want to use their privilege to make a positive impact. That’s really rare. We were so happy to find a cohort of students who agree that a fundamental part of CS education should be learning about the responsible use of products that will affect so many people.”
The course focused on ongoing project collaborations (essentially, remote internships) with three nonprofits: UTA Elaine Jiang’s group worked with Baker Ripley, building a web portal that aims to improve communications between the elderly and people who have been recently placed in the stressful, emotional role of caregivers, Head TA Nikita Ramoji’s team worked with Uplift to build a Chrome extension to autofilter content and prevent online harassment, and UTA Yuta Arai led a group of students who worked with YGA, a Turkish non-profit organization, to build a web portal accessible by a mobile app. The app interfaces with kits containing electronic hardware to help Syrian refugee children learn STEM concepts.
The class alternated between hands-on work and an ongoing dialogue in which students asked each other questions and examined issues surrounding taking responsibility for their creations. “We wanted the course to be intersectional,” explains Nikita, “because we wanted everyone to reflect on how applying what they’ve learned makes it real and concrete. We had incredibly talented students in the class, and they had a real interest in social impact.”
One of the most powerful moments, Nikita says, was looking at the midpoint presentations from each team. “It was amazing to see three separate products that will genuinely help people in the real world, outside of the classroom. As computer scientists, when we don’t remind ourselves about the rationale for what we’re doing, it’s very easy to forget the impact of our creations.”
Elaine, who will be one of the HTAs this spring, says, “This year, one of our primary goals is to ensure that all projects completed during the course will be immediately useful to the organizations we’re collaborating with.” Heila Precel, who took the course last spring and will also serve as an HTA this spring, adds, “We’re focusing on increasing the course size and constructing readings and discussions that have greater practical relevance to students.”
CSCI 1870 Cybersecurity Ethics
“Confluence” is the word that Adjunct Professor Deborah Hurley uses to describe the multiple factors that led her to create this class, but first among them was an “overwhelming student interest” in how society is being impacted by security and ethical issues. “Internet-enabled systems are ubiquitous,” she says, “even embedded in human beings. We’re training the future creators of these systems, and we need them to be built in service of humanity.”
Debuting this past summer, the course used a number of different formats, from lectures to discussions to student presentations, with carefully-selected readings as accompaniment throughout. Students ranged from first-years through seniors, plus some high school students, and to Deborah’s delight (“Interdisciplinarity is one of my religions!”), they came with varied interests: computer science, materials engineering, applied math, and more. There were multiple students who hadn’t chosen a concentration yet and others from RISD. “Having this variety lets us cross-educate one another,” Deborah says, “and we need an interdisciplinary approach to solve societal problems. This was a cohesive group of students that mixed really well.”
One of them was Alec Fujii, an international student from Tokyo who’s concentrating in engineering. “We had people from all over the world,” he says, “with many different backgrounds. It was really great to see what their perspectives were, and we need that because these problems are so complicated. For me, the main idea of the course is that as technology continues to evolve, how do we cope? How do we keep our rights and values as human beings when bioanalytics and surveillance try to turn us into numbers or make it harder to keep our identities to ourselves?”
And surveillance and bioanalytics are just two of the topics covered in the course. Deborah explains that most students come to Brown with very little ethical or philosophical training, so the first part of the class is devoted to examining the dominant ethical frameworks of this century and the last: utilitarianism, Kantianism, Aristotelian value ethics. With that under their belt, students move through a wide selection of issues at the intersection of technology and ethics, including privacy, access to government information, hate speech, fake news, encryption, and more.
To move the focus away from lecturing, student presentations make up a considerable portion of the course, which is structured around a series of milestones and Deborah providing feedback after each. “The last thing I want is for students to just be inhaling and regurgitating information,” she says. “My big emphasis is making sure that students learn, that they have one of those aha moments of real insight. I want their projects to be memorable for them, and I was really impressed with the quality and depth that I saw.”
According to Alec, the format of the class had a huge impact. “Most of my engineering classes are lecture-based and this was really my first discussion-based class at Brown. The issues aren’t as black-and-white, so we had to analyze how we look at a problem. And there are always multiple solutions, so we had to think about which would benefit or affect the most people.”
Deborah will continue the class in the summer as well as during the academic year. “Brown really emphasizes the liberal arts as our crown jewel,” she says, “and students from across the university need this material as they choose concentrations. It’s eye-opening, it’s full of things they’d never even thought or heard about. I feel very strongly about ensuring that the next generation both lives happily and benefits society, and this is an important set of issues. It’s vital that students have exposure to them before they leave. Something’s missing in their education if they don’t have that.”
DATA 0080 Data, Ethics and Society
Early in the semester, Professor Roger Blumberg asked his class to write an answer to the following question: “Imagine your typical day at Brown, from the time you wake up and the time you go to sleep; and then imagine you were at Brown thirty years ago. What do you think would be the three most significant differences in your experience as a student at Brown?” What’s really striking, he says, is that if you posed this question in 1987, looking back at to 1957, very few answers would have to do with communication. In 2018, they all do: nearly all the students mention their use of phones and laptops.
Designed as an undergraduate complement to a component of the Data Science Initiative’s Master’s program, Roger describes Data 80 as a liberal arts seminar: students read some of the great work that’s been done on technology and society, write responses to prompts, discuss and debate issues in class.
“I like to start with something concrete,” Roger says, “because I want students to become critical of not just theory but everyday practices. Introducing humanities texts in computer science is challenging – getting people to suspend their disbelief and consider technology in different ways. Sometimes students confuse being critical with being cynical, but important texts help make the distinction clear.”
“I’d never taken any classes in formalized philosophy or morality,” says Erin Bugbee, one of Roger’s students. (She’s pursuing a double concentration in Statistics and Behavioral Decision Sciences.) “Personally, I really enjoyed reading texts in a completely new area. It’s not just about having more material, it’s about having a new perspective, and I wondered why more students in the hard sciences aren’t interested in these issues. I definitely feel like they’d benefit from learning about them.”
Roger notes that some of the older students, whose perspective has already been shaped by time spent in industry, had some interesting observations that differed from those of their younger peers. “It may seem like a harsh word to use these days, but the conflict of ideas is essential for the liberal arts. Is a smartphone a wonderful portal to a wider world or a vortex from which energy and attention will never emerge? The notion of conflict may be difficult for us, but if we minimize it, we eliminate the thresholds for understanding that are so important in education. My goal for the class is for everyone to develop or improve on a free relationship to technology, to take control of technology and not be unwittingly dominated by it.”
Ideas in conflict necessarily produce some discomfort, but Erin didn’t find that to be a problem. “I like how the course exposed you to both the good and the ugly,” she says. “I think our general consensus was that data science isn’t inherently dangerous, but it can be if certain things aren’t accounted for. Since I took the class, I look at projects I’m approaching in a different way and really looking at their possible effects on society. When I was a first-year student, I wanted to be a data scientist, and I still do, but I see it differently.”
That change of perspective from someone who intends to use data in their professional life is exactly what Roger is hoping for. “This class looks at how professionals think about ethics,” he says, “and in the case of data science professionals, the consequences of their actions can be significant. Yes, the possibility of using computer science for social good is very real, but big questions need to be talked about between fields. Fortunately, we have wonderful students. The open curriculum encourages them to work across disciplines, and they do. Thirty years ago, I don’t think computer science departments had students of this caliber – they would’ve gone into medicine or law. Now they gravitate to CS.”
For Ugur, there’s a real thrill in being able to work with those students, and to see an interest in societal good shared by Brown, our faculty, and the student population. “I’m delighted to see us emphasize the use of technology to benefit society,” he says. “Our students are concerned about societal change, and so are we. In my course, and in all of these courses, we’re creating models for how to teach applied computer science and how to use CS to have tangible, meaningful results that can have a profound impact on people’s lives. We are planning to expand our offerings in this area and integrate these topics deeper and more comprehensively in our curriculum.”
As we look back on 40 years of Brown CS, successfully funding our UTA Endowment has been one of our most important but also our most gratifying recent milestones. UTAships are tremendous gifts, but in many cases, they’re also historical documents. Each of them tells a story, and some are funny (“Hotel CIT UTAship in honor of Tom Doeppner”), but others are much more. This is the story of a computer science pioneer whose tragic death inspired her classmate, alum Stephen H. Beck, to create a lasting memorial: the UTAship for Underrepresented Minority Women in memory of Marie Moses ‘82.
For privacy reasons, Brown CS records contain only limited demographic information about our students, but Marie Moses is believed to be one of our first two black female graduates. (Donna L. Woodall graduated in the same year.)
Born in Hollis, Queens, she was the eldest of three children in what her sister, Valarie, describes as an incredibly close-knit family: “When our friends would come over, sometimes they’d just sort of watch us, enjoying our family’s jokes and stories. We knew we were different and even unusual.”
“We also knew we were special because of how important our father was,” Valarie remembers. He had been James Brown’s manager in the 1960s, later was the first black partner in the entire country for Cooper and Lybrand (now Price Waterhouse), and eventually became CEO of Omnicare. “That belief drew us closer together as a family. It was us against the world.”
That closeness was clearly needed. Marie excelled at math and skipped the fifth grade, but a series of relocations exposed the family to prejudice and abuse. After a move to Westport, Connecticut, they were one of only two black families in the entire town, and Marie commuted each day to a high school in Stamford. “Marie had a tough time there,” Valarie says. “Many of the white students stayed away from her at best, and the black students taunted her and threw rocks at her for being ‘too white’ and ‘acting smart’.” Trying to protect her daughter, Marie’s mother had her learn needlepoint as a way to keep her home on weekends.
“In true Marie fashion,” says Valarie, “she not only learned needlepoint, she became adept at it.” Hard work and the ability to make hard work seem effortless had already become one of Marie’s trademarks: “She was organized, driven, and excelled at all she did, but she was also a lot of fun, incredibly loyal. Even as a child she had the characteristics that were on on full display as an adult.”
After graduating from high school at age sixteen, Valarie says that Marie was delighted to be admitted to her first-choice school, gaining a new social life and being surrounded by people who saw intelligence as something to be proud of. She’d been interested in computers before college, but this was years before the era of widespread home computing, so her first in-depth exposure to them was at Brown.
Our Father’s Daughter
Did Marie realize that she was going to become one of the first two black women with a Brown CS degree?
“It’s hard to say,” Valarie answers. “Marie didn’t talk about that, but she knew she was special and was very aware of what she’d been given in life – she volunteered for years in local nursing homes. We may have known how unusual it was for an African-American woman to major in CS at Brown, but our parents had both gone to CCNY and her success seemed like a natural continuation of our father’s legacy. She was our father’s daughter: an overachiever, very analytical, and she could command any room she walked into.”
What was Brown like then? Let’s turn to Steve Beck, who explains that he graduated at the top of his high school class but then suffered the all-too-common shock of arriving on campus and no longer being the smartest person in the room. “It was terrifying but wonderful,” he says. “I loved the Department’s rigor and discipline, but also the humor. People were expected to stand up and deliver.” Disco still ruled the airwaves, and Steve surprised himself by diving into the dance music scene and becoming a DJ. He can still be found mixing songs, only this time on his computer. “It was a passion, and it’s one I still have.”
Steve and Marie met through shared classes: “We saw each other in the lab all the time and eventually became friends. I really enjoyed our interactions – Marie had a great sense of humor, but she was even-keeled. Some of us were really wild, but she was more mature. She was unflappable.”
One of the interactions with Marie that Steve remembers most clearly was a challenging but revelatory moment. At the time, they were co-UTAs in what was then CS 11. During a group discussion with a mix of students and other UTAs on a block letters project, Steve impulsively (and, he admits in hindsight, immaturely) made a spontaneous decision on everyone’s behalf. Marie instantly called him out, mincing no words as she asked whether he was aware of the challenges facing her and other women of color on a college campus in that era.
“It was an awakening for me,” he says. “I saw a whole world that I didn’t know about, and it made a real impact.” Steve may modestly disagree, but it seems to say something about a person’s character when an encounter that could have led to resentment and anger becomes a learning moment and a catalyst for change.
Helping People
Ocie James Irons ‘81 met Marie at Brown through a shared calculus class. An only child and, he says, independent to a fault, he’d transferred to a private school in the tenth grade because he wanted to attend an Ivy League school. He describes himself as curious: “I’m not necessarily academic, but I enjoy learning. This class was more conceptual, and I wasn’t doing well. Marie was kicking ass.”
So he asked for help, walking across campus to her dorm room for tutoring with his calculus book and notes. And also, tucked under his arm, something that suggests a more than academic interest: a backgammon board. (The two later married and had a son together.)
Ocie remembers being astounded by the records and books that Marie showed him: Jonathan Livingston Seagull, Neil Diamond. “We were both black, and they were all things that I would have associated with white people. They were things I hadn’t read, or heard, and it was interesting to me, it impressed me.” Despite her formidable intelligence, there was more to Marie than studying. She was gifted at dance, Ocie says, and she had dreams of becoming a professional dancer in the same way that some of her male peers hoped for careers as athletes.
In addition to helping Ocie with calculus, Marie was looking out for other people as well, becoming a resident assistant and very much a resource for her fellow students: “She was open, helpful, very attractive, inquisitive, extremely friendly, but in a way that wasn’t off-putting. She expressed her opinions forcefully, but not aggressively, and she didn’t dominate the dialogue. She listened.”
And she listened with a real excitement, Valarie says, to groundbreaking instructors like Robert “Brother Ah” Northern, a jazz musician who had students repeat the phrase “Egypt is in Africa” aloud in class. Marie was always meticulous, marking her stack of punch cards with a diagonal line across the side (this allowed for easy reordering if they were dropped), but the boldness of statements like Northern’s appealed to her. “She was just so excited by her classes and the new ideas they exposed her to,” Valarie says. “She loved how eccentric some of her professors were. She loved all of it.”
Making A Big Impact
Marie and Ocie eventually divorced, but their son, Gregory, remained her world. “She took him everywhere,” Valarie remembers, “so he could have the broadest background possible. To me, the fact that she was such a dedicated mother is just as important as her intelligence and drive. She restructured her world for her kids.” As a single mother, Marie sometimes had to have someone watch her children, and Valarie still has the notebooks full of handwritten instructions that she kept for babysitters: “Marie wanted their every need taken care of. She wrote out in meticulous detail what she wanted the sitters to do when she wasn’t there so her kids would grow and learn.”
After graduating, Marie’s career rapidly took shape. One of her important early jobs was in programming. She was working for Genesis, a company developing something called Lifecard, a revolutionary product that would allow someone to carry around their entire medical history on a wallet-sized piece of plastic. “I was living with Marie that summer,” Valarie says, “and I was impressed that she could work long hours and still mop the kitchen floor before bedtime. On weekends, she would volunteer with Big Sisters or at a nursing home. All of this, and she still had the social life that she’d coveted for so long.”
Later, she returned to academia, becoming an adjunct professor at Walsh College and Wayne State University. But even as she traveled from city to city, earning a Master’s degree as a working single mother, her belief in giving back continued. After a move to Detroit, she started teaching high school, passionate about inspiring kids who wouldn’t otherwise be interested in math.
“From a very young age,” Ocie says, “Marie was making a big impact as an African- American woman, and she never stopped. The need to volunteer really stands out in her life.” He remembers a trip to Japan where Marie stood out physically with her height and skin color, but in other ways as well. “It was her personality and her acumen. She had a kind of edge, but not just for the sake of being noticed. She was daring enough to express who she was in the things she did and who she did them with.”
Valarie remembers that Marie never lost contact with her mentee from the Big Sisters program, even years later: “I have to say, I looked at her in amazement. ‘Marie, when do you sleep?’ And she was always so present. She always kept very late nights so the papers could be graded and the housework completed. She had that overall dedication while still being present for her family.”
The Best Kind Of Leader
In late December of 2002, something unimaginable occurred: Marie was killed by her second husband ten days after he’d been released from a Michigan emergency room. She’d brought him there after he began making threats and showing signs of mental illness, but a doctor ignored another physician’s recommendation that he be transferred to a psychiatric unit, and he was discharged. Immediately, there was an enormous hole left behind. Somehow, everything Marie had done (the volunteer work, getting her degrees, the dancing, the travel, being a family member and having a family of her own, her Lifecard innovations, the kids she’d inspired to study math) had been accomplished in just 41 years.
“He took out someone at the top of her game,” Valarie says, “and her death at Christmastime was especially cruel. The holidays were important for her because they were a time for family and friends to get together. Marie was the reason I came home for the holidays from the Peace Corps. She was the glue that held our family together as we grew older.”
“It was a huge shock,” Ocie remembers. “We don’t always think of domestic violence as something that affects everyone, but Marie’s murder calls to our attention that it can impact people regardless of their socioeconomic level.”
Finding out that Marie was gone was particularly difficult for Steve because they hadn’t been in contact for quite some time: “After school, we didn’t really stay in touch, and I deeply regret that. One of our classmates, Patty Lutsky, told me about her death, and she rallied the troops to donate to charity in Marie’s name, but I wanted to do more.”
Another person that Steve had considered honoring was Randy F. Pausch, the Brown CS alum and renowned expert in computer science, human-computer interaction, and design who died from pancreatic cancer in 2008. He and Randy had been sophomore roommates, and Steve had already set up a fundraising site for the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network (PanCAN) that ended up being quite successful. He thought about charitable giving to the UTA program in Pausch’s name, but other people had beaten him to it, so he turned his attention elsewhere. Marie’s UTAship was the result: he founded it, became the primary donor, and convinced others to give as well. (A full list of donors is at the end of this article.)
“I really wanted to honor her memory as a pioneer,” he says. “She led the way with grace, dignity, raw competence, intelligence, wit – all the things Brown CS is known for, but with humility. She was the best kind of leader.”
A Statement About Who Marie Was
“When I found out about the UTAship,” Valarie says, “I felt it was perfect. A gift like that – Marie was so generous with her knowledge and time, so I thought immediately that she would’ve loved the idea.” Ocie agrees: “I also feel a lot of joy and pride to know that Gregory will benefit from being reminded who his mother was, how she was thought of both on and off campus. That’s huge, personally, and I really appreciate that recognition.”
“And seeing people giving to her UTAship is telling,” he adds. “It lets them make a statement about who Marie was for them. If she could hear me and others talking about her today, she’d be very humble. Even in divorce, we remained friends. To this day I appreciate our relationship, all of it.”
Ocie is also glad to see how a UTAship in her honor demonstrates the importance of her alma mater to Marie: “She loved Brown, and the relationships she made there were so important. I can’t count or begin to imagine how many times I heard her say Andy van Dam’s name. And now she’s giving something to future Brown students.”
Through a gift that will renew itself each year for a different young woman, Marie’s name will always be associated with one of her lifelong priorities, the idea of giving back.
“I love that link,” Steve says. “All you have to do is follow the news cycle of the day, and for all the strides we’ve made, we keep suffering setbacks. People still look at each other differently. We have a moral imperative to be inclusive in our field, and the goal isn’t to reach a number. It should be a given that we bring in people unlike ourselves in order to change the world. I love the idea that a UTAship for underrepresented minority women marries the idea of diversity with Marie’s pioneering spirit.”
In addition to Stephen H. Beck, other donors to the UTAship for Underrepresented Minority Women in memory of Marie Moses '82 include Isaac Berkowitz; Karen Smith Catlin ‘85, P ‘18, P ‘20 and Timothy J. O. Catlin; Eugene Charniak; Justin Cohen; Maria Francesca Fernandez ‘85 ScM ‘89; Sarah Michelle Filman; Lisa Gelobter; Gregory Irons; Ocie James Irons ‘81; Patricia E. Lutsky ‘82; Norm Meyrowitz ‘81; Valarie Moses; Carol Rosenstock; Stephanie Singer; Annie Steele; and Neha Zope.
Do you remember when Donald Knuth gave the keynote at our inaugural symposium? Or when the CIT was built? What about when Tom smashed a laptop with a samurai sword or Andy walked into the Sunlab in a Darth Vader costume?
Faster than a rubber chicken flies, our fortieth anniversary has come upon us, and one of the ways we’re celebrating is by taking a major step to preserve the many artifacts (large and small, rigorous and silly) of Brown CS history. Our solution is a grassroots effort powered by homegrown technology: the Brown CS Digital Archive (BCSDA), an extension of the Brown Digital Repository. Put simply, it allows anyone on the planet to submit a piece of Brown CS history for permanent preservation online, accessible to all.
Launched this week, the BCSDA accepts more than a dozen different formats: photographs and other graphic files, audio, video, PDFs, and even code. (We’re guessing that more than a few of you have a favorite software project sitting around on a floppy disk somewhere.) All submissions will go through a virus check and be verified for accuracy, and authors/creators will retain all copyright.
We’ve populated the BCSDA with some initial assets, and we’ll be adding a lot more, but we don’t have a staff historian, so we’re depending on you. We’re looking for items with real historical interest, so please don’t send us your lecture notes, but if you take a look at the archive, you’ll see the wide variety of items that we’re looking for. After verification from an appropriate Brown CS staff or faculty member, your asset will enter the BCSDA and be available in perpetuity to anyone with an Internet connection. (Please be patient if we get a lot of submissions all at once after this article appears.)
As we’ve all seen, digital media can deteriorate much faster than expected, so we hope you’ll share your pieces of history as soon as you can. As participation increases, each new asset will add color and detail to a growing picture of what makes us the community that we are. “One of the things that truly sets Brown CS apart is our people,” says Ugur Çetintemel, Brown CS Professor and Department Chair. “We treasure these artifacts of our history because we understand and we continue the spirit of imagination, teamwork, discovery, and commitment that they embody. This archive helps us remember who we are, and it’s our gift to many future generations of computer scientists.”
Sending us something is an easy process:
The Computing Research Association (CRA) is a coalition of more than 200 organizations with the mission of enhancing innovation by joining with industry, government and academia to strengthen research and advanced education in computing. Every year, they recognize North American students who show phenomenal research potential with their Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Award, and in 2019, Brown CS made one of the strongest showings in the Honorable Mentions category. Out of fifty-two students who received Honorable Mentions, three of them are Brown CS students: Grant Fong, Silei Ren, and Nathaniel Weir. Last year, Brown CS students received three Honorable Mentions as well.
Grant explains that his work with Professor Jeff Huang is focused on the Sochiatrist project. "The overarching goal is to predict mental health issues from naturally-occurring social media data," he says. "I have been recently researching how messaging data can be used to predict mood in an ethical way. My work here is split mainly into two areas. The first is to develop robust ways to extract data from multiple platforms that can be difficult for an end user to access and provide these tools to clinical professionals so they can better understand how people communicate. The second aspect is the analysis of this data, which combines natural language processing, time series analysis, and social network analysis to deliver powerful insights."
"My primary research area," says Silei, "is security. Currently, I'm working with Professor Roberto Tamassia on designing a poisoning attack against learned index structures. Learned Index Structures are database indexing structures that uses machine learning models for faster indexing. In the attack, we showed that an adversary can slow down learned index structures by inserting a small amount of crafted data. Another project I worked on is a leakage attack against encrypted databases. Specifically, we answered the question of what an adversary can infer from an encrypted two-dimensional database based solely on the responses of k-nearest neighbors queries. Besides security, I also worked with Professor Theophilus A. Benson on software defined network (SDN) fuzz testing. We designed an algorithm that introduces systematic failures into networks for resiliency testing."
Nathaniel's work with Professor and Department Chair Ugur Çetintemel and Professor Ellie Pavlick is mostly focused on natural language processing and machine learning. "My main project," he says, "is on building an interface for users to explore databases using natural language text queries. I’ve specifically focused on how to get deep learning models to understand language in arbitrary contextual domains. Our aim is to have an interface that can be plugged into any database containing information from any context – for example, data about hospital patients or about airport flights. However, a model trained to understand language related to a hospital really struggles to understand language about the airport flights since it hasn't seen much of the language patterns in the latter domain. Our challenge is figuring out how to bootstrap this cross-domain generalization process without needing to spend the time collecting lots of training examples of queries in the new domain."

Honoring the top tech “Moguls, Founders, Engineers, Innovators and Warriors” in the world, this list recognizes those who are truly at the cutting edge of advancement within the STEM fields. This year, Forbes has included Brown CS alum danah boyd, highlighting her work on the intersection of technology and society.
danah is currently working as a Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research, is the founder and president of the Data & Society Research Institute, and serves as a Visiting Professor at New York University. She also serves on the boards of Crisis Text Line and Social Science Research Council, and is a Trustee of the National Museum of the American Indian. Currently, danah’s research focuses on how data-driven technologies can amplify inequities, mistrust, and hate; she is also widely recognized as an authority in the field of social media research. In her book It’s Complicated: the social lives of networked teens, danah explores and uncovers some of the major myths regarding teens’ use of social media. She has made an enormous impact through her work on this subject, and this recognition follows a long list of accomplishments including the Award for Public Sociology from the American Sociological Association, the naming by Fortune as the “smartest academic in the technology field” and the naming as a “Top 100 Global Thinker” by Foreign Policy.
The Hyundai Visionary Challenge is a competition to ignite learning, exploration, and development in the realm of smart mobility. It’s meant to accelerate research innovations in smart mobility that drive the creation of sustainable cities across the globe, and awards teams across a broad spectrum of categories. Encompassing biology-inspired mobility, digital phenotyping, and man-machine partnership, these categories all aim to inspire new ways of thinking to impact the world. This year, Brown CS PhD students Nakul Gopalan, Eric Rosen, and David Whitney along with Brown CLPS PhD student Daniel Ullman (whose team was advised by Stefanie Tellex) have won the annual award for their proposal, “Improving Man-Machine Partnership using Mixed Reality Social Feedback from Robots.”
“I really enjoyed being able to talk about and explore the applications of our work in the business world,” explains David as he describes the group’s project, “and I saw the potential for VR to be truly transformative for society.”
In essence, the team’s goal was to increase the efficiency of communication between robots and human workers in the workplace. As it stands, robots are very unsafe to human coworkers. Humans can’t predict the future actions of automated robots, which vastly reduces robot effectiveness on the job. The idea to solve this issue is to have workers in warehouses wear augmented reality headsets to see the future actions of moving robots in real time, minimizing collisions and significantly improving workplace output. This tool would foster interaction between humans and machines, making for a much safer work environment. It may sound futuristic, but the team has set high goals for this project, and plans to continue working and refining this man-machine partnership idea in the upcoming years.
“We live in an era of fake news,” explains Brown CS  alum Meredith Ringel Morris ‘01, “and there’s this huge idea of trustworthiness when searching for information, and my research focuses on this process of search.” Currently working as a researcher at Microsoft, Merrie works on a broad spectrum of projects including human-computer interaction, computer-supported cooperative work, social computing, and accessibility. Investigating with fellow researcher Eric Horvitz, the pair’s work on SearchTogether (an interface for collaborative web search) has recently won the ACM UIST  (User Interface Software and Technology) Lasting Impact award, recognizing the significance of their work in this field.
Merrie’s aptitude for discovery began very early on, during her undergraduate years at Brown. She completed an independent study under the guidance of Brown CS Professors Steve Reiss and David Laidlaw on visualizing the runtime of Java programs to help people find bugs. “It wasn’t anything major,” she laughs, “but it really sparked my interest in research.” This passion grew, when she found herself at Stanford working in the lab of Professor Terry Winograd on interactive workspaces.
Her work on interactive workspaces continued after graduating from Brown as Merrie completed her PhD program at Stanford and focused on gesture interaction techniques – supporting groups of people working on displays. Merrie began working at Microsoft Research in 2006, helping the company’s continuous search for innovation. But her work quickly deviated from that of years past. “When I first joined, Eric had expected that I would do more work on gestures,” Merrie remembers, “but I really started to think about search and how inefficient it is.” This led Merrie to SearchTogether, a project that has redefined the way that people collaborate and has a range of applications.
Previously, searching and querying had been a primarily isolated and individual activity. SearchTogether changed that by focusing on the specific scenario of remote collaboration when stakeholders are not physically present. Essentially by supporting awareness of search processes when others are separated, it allows for groups to query and search through information simultaneously, dramatically reducing undesired redundancies and improving work efficiency. Featuring new ideas such as search result persistence and “split search” (allowing one person to issue a query and multiple people to triage unique subsets of the search results), the system dramatically improves the division of labor in the workspace with countless applications.
What makes this work so important? Well, not only does it provide a competitive edge for Microsoft’s own search services, it really taps into the potential of collaborative information seeking and sharing. This potential is highlighted by the UIST Lasting Impact Award, which honors a UIST paper from at least ten years earlier with long-lasting impact on the UIST community and beyond. “Microsoft research tends to focus on a portfolio of long-term research, and sometimes they come up with ideas so far out of the box that they seem so futuristic at the time,” Eric explains, “and the Lasting Impact Award is one of the best affirmations you can get for your research, since it means that a segment of researchers believes the topic is meaningful, and it serves as an affirmation of a crazy idea.”
Looking back at her four years at Brown, what was most valuable? For Merrie, it was truly the abundance of opportunities for undergrads. “Being a TA in Brown’s undergrad TA program was amazing,” she says , “and it taught me to be an effective public speaker, helped my communications skills, and was just a great experience.”
In the photo above, Merrie is being given her award by Brown CS PhD Alum Steven K. Feiner, Professor of Computer Science at Columbia University. 
Adjunct Professor Donald L. Stanford of Brown CS is making a major transition in a career that's been marked by profound impact in the technology sector, education, and service to his community. Two weeks ago, he retired from his role as Chief Innovation Officer of IGT (formerly GTECH), which he joined in 1979 as its seventh employee.
In an open letter, Marco Sala, CEO of IGT, praised Don's crucial contributions to research, development, sales, marketing, and project management activities, noting that during Stanford's first 22 years with GTECH, the company grew from a market share of five percent and sales of less than $1 million to a dominant worldwide market share of 70 percent, and sales in excess of $1 billion by the end of 2002. That was also the year in which Don began teaching for Brown CS and Brown's School of Engineering, and he now lectures for the Executive Master's program at the School of Professional Studies as well.
"Don has had an enormous impact on our Company," Sala says, "as a founding leader of the technology group, and later as an innovation mentor. He has worked tirelessly over four decades to ensure our lottery products and solutions have continuously eclipsed our competition while helping our customers grow their businesses."
Don's career has also been marked by considerable service to the community. He received the Black Engineer of the Year Award for Professional Achievement and the Honorable Thurgood Marshall Award for community service in 1999. Three years later, he received Brown University Graduate School's Distinguished Alumni Award. He also serves on the board of three Rhode Island organizations: the R.I. Business Innovation Factory, Year Up Providence, and Spectra Systems.
“With 2019 marking my 40th year with IGT," Don says, "I felt it was fitting to close this part of my career on this anniversary, and at a time when the organization is experiencing its greatest successes to date. I’m looking forward to enjoying more time with my family, pursuing my hobbies, and continuing to teach at Brown, where I plan to keep working with our university partners to identify new talent.”
You can watch Don reflect on his career at IGT and share his future plans in this short video.

"The CS community has talked about Exascale computing for a decade," says Brown CS Master's alum Prabhat, who recently received the ACM Gordon Bell Prize with colleagues from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and NVIDIA, "and I'm thrilled that we were among the first ones to get there with a project that addresses one of the most important problems for all of us and our children."
Strongly contested on an international scale, the Gordon Bell Prize is awarded each year to recognize outstanding achievement in high-performance computing. It represents the highest honor for supercomputing experts, second perhaps only to the Turing Award. Prabhat and his team earned the prize by training a deep neural network to identify extreme weather patterns from high-resolution climate simulations, showing that accurate segmentation masks can be extracted for patterns such as tropical cyclones and atmospheric rivers.
"In the popular media, climate change is typically characterized by highly simplified quantities such as global, annual mean temperature or global sea level rise. Increasingly, the general public is interested in the impact of climate change and how climate change will affect them where they live,” Prabhat explains. “In order to address such questions, climate scientists need to develop capabilities for precision analytics: can we examine a 100-year climate simulation and automatically extract pixel-level segmentation masks corresponding to Hurricanes, Nor’easters and Atmospheric Rivers? It turns out that AI (and in particular Deep Learning) are up to the task, but there is a major performance bottleneck to overcome first. Our world-class team, comprising of researchers from NERSC, NVIDIA, and OLCF was able to adapt state-of-the-art segmentation architectures to work on million-pixel, 16-channel climate datasets, obtaining ~40TF performance on Volta GPUs, and 1.13 EF (16-bit) performance on the OLCF Summit system."
Prabhat began his career at Brown by earning his Master's degree in 2001, then spent more than a half-decade working at the Center for Computation and Visualization. "IMHO, there's no better school than Brown for breadth, depth, and exposure to other domain sciences," he says. "I was attracted to Brown by pioneers and strong mentors like Andy van Dam, who was always enthusiastic about learning himself and teaching others. David Laidlaw opened my eyes to the amazing, diverse possibilities of scientific visualization. I had the unique privilege of working with Thomas Banchoff and David on visualizing 4D mathematical objects in the CAVE for my Masters thesis. Upon graduation, Sam Fulcomer presented me with the  opportunity to work on diverse scientific projects at the CAVE, and CCV staff gave me room to grow and explore my interests. Working with Jim Head and Andy Forsberg on interactive visualization of large scale Martian topography and imagery data was probably the highlight of my time at CCV; I’d probably credit Jim the most for inspiring me to pursue a PhD in Earth Sciences at UC Berkeley."
Upon transitioning to Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, Prabhat's research interests shifted towards scientific visualization of large data sets, data management and supercomputing. He is currently the Data and Analytics Services Group Lead for the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), where his group is responsible for deploying the Big Data stack for over 7000 science users.
“Our team is very proud of breaking the exaflop barrier and winning the Gordon Bell Prize. We’ve charted a new course for extreme scaling of Deep Learning architectures on HPC platforms. More than just a performance number, a research paper and an award, I’m personally most excited about the long-term possibilities for climate science. We now have a precision analytics tool that can help in assessing the impact of climate change for society at large. That is what really counts." Prabhat concludes.

"The world is changing rapidly," says Brown University's John Savage, An Wang Professor Emeritus of Computer Science, "and to address our society's grand challenges, we need to engage in outreach."
"Take the example," he says, "of national security in the early 1950s: the US was challenged by the Soviet Union. President Eisenhower, wanting to formulate a policy toward this aggressive nuclear power, convened foreign policy specialists in meetings now referred to as Project Solarium. Today, we are confronted with serious new international challenges in which computers, networks, and cyber weapons play a key role. To understand and address the problems created by these new technologies, computer scientists must engage with political scientists, sociologists, psychologists, historians, area specialists, and others. While the hardest problems cross disciplinary boundaries, Brown is poised to continue its long tradition of multidisciplinary research and outreach in addressing the new problems of the cyber age."
We caught up with John just after his recent talk ("Cyber Security: A Societal Grand Challenge"), which was a retirement lecture in name only. (John is currently teaching in Brown's new Executive Master in Cyber Security degree program and will be teaching CSCI 1800 Cyber Security and International Relations to more than 185 students next semester.) At the reception afterward, Provost Richard Locke announced an important milestone: the establishment of the John E. Savage Endowed Professorship in Computer Science, funded with very generous gifts from John's family and friends.
Intended to honor John's legacy and support future scholars, the gift marks the beginning of a major fundraising effort in support of CS With Impact, the biggest expansion in Brown CS history and part of the BrownTogether campaign. As part of this effort, CS will seek to raise a minimum of $40 million to create ten new endowed chairs, which will be supplemented with the creation of five lecturer positions, for a total of fifteen new faculty slots.
Fifty years ago, Locke explained, even the idea of computer science as a department was highly controversial. Today, CS is Brown's largest concentration, acting as an intellectual hub for researchers who are helping decipher disease, understand the human brain, keep our data secure, and develop new technologies that improve lives.
To ensure that the University remains at the forefront of developing these tools, and that its students have access to the most advanced computer science education, Brown recently launched CS With Impact, which will dramatically expand Brown CS over the next five years. New faculty will help mitigate enrollment pressures and build bridges to other parts of Brown through joint appointments and with other disciplines.
First announced by President Christina Paxson less than two years ago, at John's fiftieth anniversary celebration, the John E. Savage Endowed Professorship in Computer Science was recently established and is now the first of what will be ten new endowed professorships in the CS With Impact expansion. At this time, the Savage chair will support an assistant professor. Brown is seeking a matching amount in additional donations, so that the chair can support a full professor.  
"When I came to Brown in 1967," John says, "I could see that the students were bright, curious, and wanted to take charge of their education. I was also impressed by the large amount of faculty interaction. For example, a chance interaction with a cognitive psychologist in the 1970s led to my co-teaching a human memory models course in the Psychology Department for four years. The freedom to pursue research worth doing has been very stimulating for me, and I'm delighted that we're adding these new faculty members via endowed professorships. It's the best way to build on our strength in CS and create opportunities for new directions as well."
On the afternoon of December 13, 2018, friends and colleagues gathered in the CIT to honor Professor John Savage, one of the co-founders of Brown CS, as he gave a lecture ("Cyber Security: A Societal Grand Challenge") that drew from a career of more than five decades. Although billed as a retirement lecture, John continues to teach in Brown's new Executive Master in Cyber Security degree program and has more than 185 students enrolled in his CSCI 1800 Cyber Security and International Relations class next semester. John's wife, Patricia, was also in attendance, and the talk was followed by a special reception at which colleagues offered toasts in his honor.
Department Chair Ugur Çetintemel opened the lecture by praising John's research and teaching and citing an article that John wrote more than twenty years ago, in which he had the foresight to encourage computer scientists to "become more outward directed" and "understand the problems that arise in computationally demanding science and business applications so we can help solve them". He thanked John for an extraordinary set of contributions to Brown: Savage served as Department Chair of Brown CS, Chair of the Task Force on Faculty Governance, and Chair of the Faculty Executive Committee, among other leadership roles. John received the President's Award for Faculty Governance in 2009.
His service to professional societies and in the field of cyber security and Internet governance are equally storied: John has been a member of the NSF Review Panel on Emerging Technologies and the Program Committee for the IEEE/ACM International Symposium On Nanoscale Architectures, a Jefferson Science Fellow for the US Department of State, an honored advisor for the government of Vietnam, and a member of the Scientific and Technical Intelligence Committee. He is a Fellow of AAAS and ACM, a Life Fellow of IEEE, a Guggenheim Fellow, a Professorial Fellow of the EastWest Institute, and the recipient of a Fulbright-Hays Research Award.
But as John himself pointed out two years ago, one of the most remarkable aspects of his career is how he, Brown CS, and the field of computer science co-evolved. Savage co-founded the Department, led the effort that established a multi-decade partnership with Sun Microsystems, played a major role in seeing the CIT built, and founded the Industry Partners Program, but even as he was serving both Brown and the public sector at large, he was publishing three books and pursuing diverse interests that included computational complexity, scientific computation, computational nanotechnology, and cyber security policy and technology. 
In his lecture, John drew on the full spectrum of his life's research and teaching to make an exacting case that cyber security dangers pose a threat to the very existence of our nation and our democracy, and that a "whole society approach" from a comprehensive set of experts and everyday users is necessary to combat it. He began with a balanced picture of a world that has benefited enormously from technological advances (currently, 55% of people worldwide are connected to the Internet and extreme poverty has plummeted globally to 9.1%) but is gravely threatened by technological misuse in the form of audio and visual fakery, lethal autonomous weapons, privacy violations, and numerous other dangers. Gone are the days, John said, in which the Internet could be seen as a "threatening but not terribly threatening" Wild West.
The facts of the case, Savage maintained, are stark: computer scientists can't secure technology alone, hardware and software errors will always exist, and security requires constant attention. "Above all," he said, "humans have important cognitive limitations" and share the same biases as our ancestors of 70,000 years ago: "To succeed, we must engage multiple human perspectives." Much of the responsibility lies with us as computer scientists, John said, offering solutions such as increasing the amount of security content in CS curricula, using memory-managed languages, and experimenting with segmented system architectures.
But perhaps most importantly, he argued that other domain experts are needed for true and lasting security by helping to counter social engineering strategies, examine misaligned incentives, assess the impact of technology on our privacy, and explore the role of history and culture on diplomacy. This includes the work of psychologists, economists, social scientists, political scientists, historians, and others. "Where is the wisdom required for this huge effort?" John asked in his conclusion. "I don't think it's just in computer science." 
At the reception afterward, colleague after colleague stepped up to the lectern to offer a toast. "Versatility, service, and discipline," were the three words that Professor Andy van Dam used to describe John; Professor Roberto Tamassia mentioned John's commitment to collaborative work, remembering the days when Savage was instrumental in envisioning and launching projects at the largest scale, including grants for more than ten million dollars in which practically the entire faculty were listed as investigators. "Because of John," said Professor Anna Lysyanskaya, the Brown CS culture of warmth and mentoring is still unmistakable. "We're like a family, and that hasn't changed."
The final tribute was from Provost Richard M. Locke, who joked about envying Savage's discipline every time he arrived at the gym at 6:30 in the morning, only to see John and Patricia leaving the facility, their workouts already complete. But he quickly moved to words of high praise: "John is an example of everything wonderful about Brown...the scholarship, the teaching, but also as a person." He recognized Savage for his warmth, intellectual curiosity, and ability to make connections, but most of all for having the sort of vision that guides "not just what it means to be a great university, but how we conduct our lives". John and Brown CS, Locke said, are truly intertwined.
And that connection was clearly in John's thoughts as he rose for a few final remarks, saying that he was proud and pleased of the work that "many individuals" had done to help Brown CS grow: "We truly are a community, so we must have done something right...I thank all of you as well."
A recording of the lecture is available here.
In an endeavor to increase opportunities for students and broaden excellence in research and teaching, Brown University will expand its Department of Computer Science over the next five years, adding 10 tenure track faculty members and five lecturers, as well as boosting support for collaborative, high-impact research.
The expansion, the largest in the 40-year history of the department, comes in the context of rapid growth in student enrollment in computer science, which is now the largest undergraduate concentration at Brown. The plan also reflects a recognition of the ever-expanding role of computation in the modern world.
“Computation is central to the modern university and applies to many fields," said Brown Provost Richard M. Locke. “Tools and insights from computer science are helping to decipher disease, understand the human brain and develop new technologies that improve lives. We want to make sure Brown remains at the forefront of developing those tools and insights, and that our students have access to the most advanced computer science education.”
Locke added that the strengths of computational research—particularly at Brown—are well aligned with the areas of integrated scholarship identified in Brown’s strategic plan, Building on Distinction.
Ugur Cetintemel, a professor and chair of computer science, says the department’s CS With Impact expansion will have far-reaching benefits to the University community as a whole.
“The goal is to make sure that all students — concentrators and non-concentrators alike — have a chance to interface with computer science,” Cetintemel said. “At the same time, the effort will expand our department’s engagement with other units on campus that draw upon computer science resources and expertise. Our goal is to elevate Brown's scholarly impact by increasing collaboration between CS and other disciplines.”
A Rapid Expansion
After its founding in 1979, the Brown Department of Computer Science quickly established itself as one of the top departments in the nation. Brown faculty members have made pioneering contributions in a wide array of research areas including computer graphics, object-oriented programming languages (a paradigm that gave rise to modern computer languages like Java and Python) and databases, and the synchronization of programs in multi-processor computer systems. Brown alums have gone on to chair computer science departments around the country, including powerhouse departments at MIT and the University of Washington, and hold top jobs at industry giants like Google, Intel and Microsoft.
Interest in computer science among Brown students has skyrocketed in recent years. In 2010, Brown awarded 48 undergraduate degrees in computer science. In 2018, that number was 248. For the 2018-19 academic year, 588 students have declared a concentration in computer science — one-sixth of the undergraduate population.
Yet in a rigorous Open Curriculum environment that encourages undergraduates to study what they love and architect their own education, interest extends well beyond students who have chosen a specific focus in computer science. More than half of the undergraduate Brown student body took at least one computer science course during the last academic year.
Junior Eleanor Avril’s journey into a computer science concentration is similar to that of many of her peers. When she arrived at Brown, she hadn’t considered CS, but like many of her friends, decided to take an introductory CS class. She was instantly hooked by the problem-solving aspect of the classwork, she says, and intrigued by how broadly CS tools could be applied. That broad applicability is a motivator for many new CS concentrators, Avril says.
“There’s a definite sense that you can take computer science and apply it in some way to almost any other area,” she said. “I know a lot of people who are studying computer science and visual arts, because they’re interested in design. I know people who are doing natural language processing because they’re interested in linguistics. There are so many ways to apply CS, and I think it’s very compelling for students.
“Having the problem-solving ability and the technical background is useful even for people who don’t end up going directly into software engineering,” Avril added.
Teaching And Research
The addition of 15 new professors and lecturers will help meet student demand for a broad selection of classes, keep class sizes in check and ensure that undergraduates have ample opportunities for research in collaboration with faculty. The five lecturer positions will be dedicated to teaching. The 10 tenure-track positions will have teaching and research responsibilities.
Cetintemel says the tenure-track hires will bolster existing and emerging strengths in the department in areas like artificial intelligence and robotics, digital liberties, computer education research, and visual computing with a focus on societal impact.
“We envision a third of the tenure-track hires having one foot in computer science and one foot in another academic discipline,” he said. “These would be people who bring CS tools to bear in another field of study — perhaps economics, health or visual arts as examples. Or perhaps someone who works in public policy matters that apply to digital liberties or cybersecurity.”
That kind of collaboration would continue an ethos that has existed in the Brown computer science department from the beginning, Cetintemel says. Current collaborative projects include:
Cetintemel says that the CS With Impact expansion will enhance these existing projects and create new programs. Expanded research also means more opportunity for students at both the graduate and undergraduate levels, as student research is a hallmark of the Brown CS education.
“Brown students want to solve problems for the public good,” said Stefanie Tellex, an assistant professor of computer science who specializes in robotics. “They see courses like Computer Science for Social Impact, and they know that CS is a powerful tool for any profession. My undergraduate researchers are already doing world-class work, teaching robots through social feedback and interacting with them in virtual reality. I’m confident that they’ll help build a future where robots are a valuable part of everyday life.”
Cetintemel says the initiative also aims to increase alum engagement and fundraising for the department, expanding upon recent successes. In May 2018, the University successfully raised $10 million in support of the department’s Undergraduate Teaching Assistant program. A cornerstone of the Brown CS education, the program engages experienced students to help teach their peers. The department hopes to build on the teaching assistant fundraising success by raising additional funding for named faculty positions and research programs.
Ultimately, Cetintemel says, CS With Impact is centered upon making sure that Brown students will be intellectual leaders in bringing data and computational tools to address the problems of the 21st century.
“In many ways, Brown is turning out the kind of technology leaders the world needs,” Cetintemel said. “Our students tend to be entrepreneurial and steeped in a variety of perspectives that are gleaned in exploring many areas of study. It’s these kinds of people who will make sure computational tools are used in ways that make people’s lives and society better.”
The IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) has established itself as the world’s premier research conference in data mining and analytics. The conference covers aspects of data mining, including algorithms, software, systems and applications, and presents the Best Student Paper Award annually to a published paper presenting innovative solutions to challenging data mining problems, whose first author is a student. This year, “ProSecCo: Progressive Sequence Mining with Convergence Guarantees”, a paper by  Brown CS student Sacha Servan-Schreiber and Brown PhD alums Matteo Riondato and Emanuel Zgraggen, was  named the runner-up for this award.
Sacha is currently a senior at Brown pursuing an Sc.B in Computer Science, with academic interests in applied cryptography, decentralized networks, and data science. Matteo is a research scientist in the Labs group at Two Sigma, an innovative investment firm, and also holds an appointment as Adjunct Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Brown. Emanuel is a PostDoctoral Associate at MIT’s CSAIL DataBase Group with research interests including HCI, InfoVis, and Data Science. In their paper, the trio present an algorithm for progressive mining of frequent sequences from large transactional datasets. “The algorithm processes the datasets in blocks and outputs, after having analyzed each block, a high-quality approximation of the collection of frequent sequences,” they explain. Thanks to its properties, ProSecCo enables interactive data exploration, allowing analysts to remain engaged and continuously discover new insights from data.
Sacha, Matteo, and Emanuel’s paper can be found here.
“In recent years, many techniques have been developed to improve the performance and efficiency of data center networks,” writes Professor Theophilus “Theo” A. Benson of Brown CS, as he explains the significance of his most recent paper on Deep Learning. This paper was recently recognized by ACM SIGCOMM, and was a runner-up at a large workshop just this year. SIGCOMM is the ACM’s professional forum for the discussion of topics in the field of communications and computer networks, with a particular focus in systems engineering and architectural questions of communication.
Currently, Theo’s work is precisely in this field as his specialty is in solving practical networking and systems problems, with a focus on software defined networking, data centers, clouds, and configuration management. This paper centers on how many data center networking techniques (routing, topology augmentation, energy savings) share design and architectural similarities. He presents a framework for developing general representations of network topologies using deep learning to solve a large class of data center problems, and to simplify the process of configuring and training deep learning agents. This framework was used to implement a DeepConf-agent that tackles the data center topology augmentation problem, and resulted in performance comparable to the optimal solution. 
This paper follows a natural evolution of Theo’s research, as he works on understanding and designing techniques for data analysis. His paper “Network Traffic Characteristics of Data Centers in the Wild” won the best paper award at IMC 2010. This was followed by his paper “MicroTE: Fine Grained Traffic Engineering for Data Centers,” which involved work with Microsoft on domain specific algorithm to improve the performance of data centers, and his paper “YTrace: End-to-End Performance Diagnosis in Large Cloud and Content Providers,” which explored domain specific techniques for diagnosis at Yahoo data centers. His research has progressed from large scale analysis, to domain specific heuristics, to application of statistical techniques, before finally evolving to machine learning.
We're proud to announce that a team of four members from the Brown University Executive Master in Cybersecurity (EMCS) Class of 2019 won first place in the policy category at CSAW’18, the world’s largest student-led hacking and security competition. The New York University Tandon School of Engineering hosted the policy portion of CSAW in the U.S., one of the event’s six international venues which combined totaled over 20,000 participants worldwide.
Winning team members from EMCS ’19 include Adam DiPetrillo, George Hasseltine, Joshua Snavely, and Chad Thiemann.
The Team’s Winning Proposal: Securing U.S. Election Infrastructure
Competing at NYU against 28 teams comprised of PhD, Master's, law school, and undergraduate students, the team chose as their topic, Policy Recommendations for Securing the U.S. Elections. In the wake of the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election, and its exposure of the vulnerability of the nation’s election infrastructure and voter registration databases at the state and municipal levels, the team asserted, “the question is not if, but when they will be breached,” and called on Congress to act immediately to ensure safe and secure elections.
In their memo to the U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security, the team proposed legislation that would improve protection of the election infrastructure through:
As part of CSAW’s submission requirement, the team created a three-minute video summarizing the proposed legislation and the urgency for it. In this jointly crafted quote, team members shared, "It was a great honor for all of us on the team to develop a winning proposal that addresses one of the biggest threats to our nation’s democracy – the vulnerability of our voter infrastructure system. Our success can be directly attributed to our teamwork and the support of our EMCS cohort and staff. Many kudos to the competition – their efforts significantly raised the bar. While the competition is over, our collective efforts are not complete. We must strive to continuously engage legislators and election officials to refine and implement such policies to secure our democracy."
Commenting on the team’s success, Brown University EMCS Program Director and Adjunct Professor of Computer Science Alan Usas said, "Placing first in the CSAW competition is a tremendous achievement by this outstanding team from the EMCS Class of 2019. They created a winning proposal that reflects the major tenant of the EMCS program that cybersecurity leadership lives at the intersection of policy, technology, privacy and human factors.  I look forward to seeing the team progress this plan to the next level."
In Brooklyn, where the EMCS team competed, some 100 professionals and faculty worked with NYU Tandon student leaders to create, judge, and organize the giant event, supported by 30 industry and government partners. The Borough President proclaimed November 8 as NYU Tandon CSAW 15th Anniversary Day in Brooklyn.
Last week, Professor Kathi Fisler of Brown CS was in Boston to give the November 8 keynote address for OOPSLA (ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and Applications). OOPSLA is one of the main international conferences on programming languages and software engineering, with a current focus beyond object-oriented programming. It's part of the umbrella SPLASH conference (Systems, Programming, Languages, and Applications: Software for Humanity), which brings together OOPSLA and several smaller conferences and tracks with related themes.
Kathi's talk ("In Defense of Little Code") addressed the interplay between quantitative big-data methods and qualitative small-data methods in computing education around programming and programming languages. She also promoted the idea of bringing introductory computer science and introductory data science together under the theme of "data-centric computing", an approach that she's been piloting in Brown's new CSCI 0111 course this fall.
Her talk presented work that was jointly done with Brown CS Professor Shriram Krishnamurthi, Brown CS PhD students Preston Tunnell Wilson and Sam Saarinen, and Worcester Polytechnic Institute PhD student Francis Castro, who is finishing his dissertation with Kathi in the coming year. 
Network performance has been one of Brown CS Professor Theophilus "Theo" A. Benson's core interests for years. And network performance in emerging regions, he says, is particularly interesting because it requires us to question assumptions about what works and what doesn't: "We can't just transplant network protocols designed for massive tech companies to developing countries, where there are huge infrastructure discrepancies." Earlier this year, he won a Google Faculty Award to develop network optimizations that can be brought to bear in developing countries, often overlooked, where mobile devices have become the primary mode of Internet access. The full list of recipients is available here.
The project begins in Pakistan, where Theo explains that mobile devices are often equipped with small memory sizes and slow CPUs. "For example," he says, "according to a recent study of mobile devices in Pakistan, 90% of devices were equipped with at most 1024 MB of RAM and 89% had 1 GHz or slower processors. Despite the prevalence of such devices in these markets, there are few systematic studies of the differences between web performance on low-end and high-end smartphones."
The first step of the project will involve using low-end smartphones popular in Pakistan to conduct a large-scale measurement study to identify bottleneck resources (for example, CPU, memory, and network) in the page load process and analyze how these bottlenecks may change over time based on device characteristics, network connectivity, and page structure. Insights from this study, Theo believes, will help in understanding the effectiveness of various infrastructure design choices (such as the role of CDNs) and page load optimization techniques (for example, Polaris) for developing regions.
"We also believe from anecdotal evidence," Theo says, "that small memory sizes in existing low-end smartphones are a significant pain point. We're going to determine when, where, and why memory bloats —potentially leading to stalls and crashes— occur for different popular web pages. Using these insights, we'll develop optimizations that would aim to throttle the usage of memory-heavy web page resources."
This latest research continues work for which Theo earned a Richard B. Salomon Faculty Research Award earlier this year.
Finally, this Google Faculty Award is one of Beson's two recent grants. In late summer, he also received an unrelated National Science Foundation grant for a project that aims to improve network performance by tailoring web server configurations to match the specifics of each application and end user's technology. If successful, this proposal will fundamentally impact widely accepted principles for managing services and will enable a broad range of users to benefit from efficient operation of the growing set of essential web services.
Toymaker, a seven-minute animated short created in 2017 by Brown CS Professor Barbara Meier and her students, has already been accepted at multiple national and international film festivals and won the Music Award in the Student Competition of the 13th Athens Animfest. Just this month, it's been accepted at four more festivals:
All events are open to the public. You can also read an in-depth feature on the making of Toymaker that includes a link to the film.
Professor Sohini Ramachandran of Brown University's Center for Computational Molecular Biology (she also serves as its Director) and Department of Computer Science has just had one of her recent projects, SWIF(r), mentioned in Nature, the multidisciplinary science journal. Originally published ("Localization of adaptive variants in human genomes using averaged one-dependence estimation") in Nature Communications, the research involves creating a machine learning algorithm to examine the genomes of a group of hunter-gatherers from southern Africa, then flag variations near genes associated with metabolism. Sohini and her collaborators speculate that the genetic changes they observed may allow their holders to store body fat at times when sufficient food isn't available.  
"Using statistical methods for identifying adaptive mutations from population genetic data is challenging," Sohini says, "There are several obstacles: assessing the significance of genomic outliers, integrating correlated measures of selection into one analytic framework, and distinguishing adaptive variants from hitchhiking neutral variants. SWIF(r) is a probabilistic method that detects selective sweeps by learning the distributions of multiple selection statistics under different evolutionary scenarios and calculating the posterior probability of a sweep at each genomic site. It explicitly models the joint distributions of selection statistics, thereby increasing its power to both identify regions undergoing sweeps and localize adaptive mutations. And because it provides a transparent probabilistic framework for localizing beneficial mutations, it's also extensible to a variety of evolutionary scenarios."
In addition to our many other lectures throughout the semester, Brown CS is excited to announce that Professor Robert Tarjan of Princeton University will be delivering the annual Paris C. Kanellakis Memorial Lecture on December 6. This talk comes on the heels of the recent Distinguished Lecture Series (featuring Professor Jennifer Rexford of Princeton University and Professor Dawn Song of UC Berkeley), and will be taking place at 4:00 PM at CIT 368.
Professor Rexford explored the application of research from a variety of established disciplines to the field of Computer Networking through her lecture, “Hitting the Nail on the Head: Interdisciplinary Research in Computer Networking.” Rexford is the Gordon Y.S. Wu Professor of Engineering and the Chair of Computer Science at Princeton University, and holds a PhD from the University of Michigan. Her lecture focused primarily on the innovating work within the field of computer networking, ranging from data-center networks, to cellular networks, to vehicular networks. This breakneck innovation necessarily requires unique solutions to the biggest problems facing the field, and Rexford illustrated how these solutions are often found beyond the field of computer networking.
Professor Song investigated challenges and opportunities at the intersection of AI and Security through her talk, “AI and Security: Lessons, Challenges, and Future Directions”, on October 3. Song is a professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley and holds a PhD from UC Berkeley. Her research lies within security and privacy issues in computer systems, and she has received many awards for her work in computer security and deep learning. In this talk, Song explained the role of AI and Deep learning in improving computer security systems, and delved into how machine learning must be balanced with privacy preservation.
Professor Tarjan will be analyzing theoretical approaches to algorithm design through his lecture, “Algorithms: Theory Meets Practice.” Professor Tarjan is the Distinguished University Professor of Computer Science at Princeton University as well as the Chief Scientist at Intertrust Technologies, and holds a PhD from Stanford University. He has held academic positions at Cornell, UC Berkeley, Stanford, and NYU, and industrial research positions at Bell Labs, NEC, HP, and Microsoft. His work focuses on the design and analysis of data structures and graph and network algorithms, and he has published over 250 papers. This lecture will be delving into how faster speeds and larger memory sizes of current computers vastly increase the size of the design space for even simple problems, and the role that theoretical approaches to algorithm design can help systematically explore this space. Such approaches can produce algorithms algorithms that are correct and efficient as well as simple to program, and Tarjan aims to illustrate this point through real-world applic
The ACM Karlstrom Award is presented annually to outstanding educators in recognition for the advancement of new teaching methodologies and for significant contributions to the development and expansion of  computer science and engineering. Professor Andy van Dam of Brown CS received the award for his impact on shaping the next generation of computer scientists in 1993, and this year, his fifty-third at Brown, marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of that recognition.
Although widely recognized in the field of computer graphics, Andy has always retained a unique passion for inspiring many thousands of students through his many years teaching. Even when Computer Science was still in its infancy and a mere shadow of its current form, Andy was at the forefront of guiding young minds through the subject. He taught the world’s first high school program in Computer Science in Philadelphia in 1962, and cites this experience as being pivotal in shaping his path towards academia. Andy went on to co-found the Department of Computer Science with John Savage at Brown, chairing the department from 1979-1985 and playing a central role in its development over the years.
When asked about his ability to impact so many students in such a meaningful way, Andy cites his unrelenting passion and commitment to teaching as being of utmost importance to him: “I have recorded nearly all my lectures so I can listen to them, and learn what to do better.” Andy has had a predominant role in retaining this kind of focus and attention on undergraduate education that remains a hallmark of the Brown CS program. From instituting a comprehensive undergraduate Teaching Assistant program (currently with 46 UTAs and 4 head UTAs in his introductory CS course alone) to helping to establish the departmental culture of considering teaching a central responsibility of all Brown CS faculty, this emphasis on quality undergraduate education has continued to foster a community of learning to this day.
In a testament to his influence and impact on so many within the Computer Science field, one of Andy’s undergraduate teaching and research assistants, the late CMU professor Randy Pausch himself went on to win the very same Karlstrom award for his work inventing the Alice 3D programming environment for creating VR experiences. The two were the only advisor-advisee pair to win the award, and when asked about Randy, Andy said that he was marked by “his huge investment in undergraduate teaching, his unrelenting optimism, and his overall energy”.
Although Andy continues to be recognized for his work in Computer Science (recently being named to the SIGGRAPH Academy for contributions to computer graphics), it is his commitment to teaching that has touched the lives of so many students over the years.
Brown CS will host Professor John Savage on Thursday, December 13, 2018, at 4 PM in CIT 368. John has spent 51 years at Brown and became Professor Emeritus in July, 2018. To commemorate this occasion, he will give a lecture ("Cybersecurity: A Grand Challenge for the Society") hosted by Professor and Department Chair Ugur Çetintemel. A reception will follow.
The cyber security problem, John says, is now a grand challenge problem that impacts all aspects of life. Making cyberspace safe is a complex problem that requires the engagement of all segments of society.
Dr. John E. Savage is the An Wang Emeritus Professor of Computer Science at Brown University. He earned his PhD in Electrical Engineering at MIT in 1965, joining Bell Laboratories in the same year. He moved to Brown University in 1967, co-founded the Department of Computer Science, and served as its second chair from 1985 to 1991. He has served Brown in many capacities including as Chair of the Faculty Executive Committee and Chair of the 2002-2003 Task Force on Faculty Governance. He was a member of the MIT Corporation Visiting Committee for EECS from 1991-2002. In 2011 he gave Congressional testimony on cyber security before the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism of the United States Senate. He has done research on coding and communication theory, theoretical computer science, VLSI theory, silicon compilation, scientific computing, computational nanotechnology, the performance of multicore chips, reliable computing with unreliable elements, blockchain governance, and cyber security policy.
He is a Guggenheim Fellow and a Fellow of AAAS and ACM, and a Life Fellow of IEEE. He served as Jefferson Science Fellow in the U.S. Department of State in 2009-2010. He is a Professorial Fellow at the EastWest Institute, a member of the Board of the Michael Dukakis Institute, and a member of the Board of Advisors of the Verified Voting Foundation. He served as a member of the Rhode Island Cybersecurity Commission and participated in the 2016 Munich Security Conference as a member of the McCain-Whitehouse U.S. Congressional Delegation.
K-12 schools and districts planning to add computer science to their offerings face the challenge of creating sequences of classes out of many standalone curricular options, each targeting different contexts and content. Earlier this month, the National Math and Science Institute announced a coalition of national education groups that includes Bootstrap (a K-12 CS curriculum used worldwide that's directed by Kathi Fisler, Shriram Krishnamurthi, and Emmanuel Schanzer of Brown CS) to address this problem with a new approach.
In the current phase, coalition members are working together to define and explain the connections among their programs to educators. Members will offer coordinated professional development to participating schools, then work with schools and districts to design customized, cohesive CS programs that span multiple grades by stitching together existing curricula in meaningful ways.
“By helping schools incorporate computer science across courses and grade levels, we are increasing students’ opportunities to develop these skills within the context of the math, science, arts and language courses they already are taking,” says Emmanuel Schanzer of Bootstrap. “Education research confirms that students and teachers excel when classwork is tied to familiar experiences. This approach supports that type of learning.”
The new coalition is made of up of seven national educational groups and will start training teachers in three San Antonio districts in 2019.
The full press release is available here.
IEEE VIS, the world's largest conference on scientific visualization, information visualization, and visual analytics is now over, and Brown CS PhD candidate Johannes Novotny and his collaborators have returned with the Best Poster Award for their work ("Developing Virtual Reality Visualizations of Dinosaur Track Creation with Scientific Sketching") in using virtual reality (VR) to analyze dinosaur footprints. His co-authors include Brown CS Master's alum Joshua Tveite, Brown PhD candidate Morgan L. Turner, Professor Stephen Gatesy of Brown's Division of Biology and Medicine, Professor Fritz Drury of the Rhode Island School of Design, Lecturer Peter Falkingham of Liverpool John Moores University, and Brown CS Professor David H. Laidlaw.
"Large-scale simulations of substrate flow," the researchers explain, "have recently been used to explore the relationship between track morphology and foot movement using data from modern birds and fossilized specimens found in the field. However, the spatial complexity of these unsteady flow datasets make it difficult to analyze them using off-the-shelf visualization tools." 
In response, Johannes and his co-authors conducted a two-year design study of developing VR flow visualization tools for the analysis of dinosaur track creation using the Scientific Sketching design methodology created by Brown CS PhD alum Daniel F. Keefe and his collaborators. They enlisted the aid of twenty-five art and computer science students from a VR design course who continually created visualizations in an iterative process guided by paleontologist collaborators through multiple critique sessions. This allowed them to explore a wide range of potential visualization methods and select the most promising methods for actual implementation, eventually resulting in visualizations that answered research questions and generated new insight into the simulation datasets.

Professor Dawn Song of UC Berkeley visited Brown CS earlier this month to deliver the thirty-seventh lecture ("AI and Security: Lessons, Challenges and Future Directions") in the Distinguished Lecture Series.
Described as an innovator and "serial entrepreneur" in Professor Roberto Tamassia's introduction, Song began by setting a historical backdrop of cyberattacks that are increasing in number, financial cost, and volume of users exposed. "And as AI becomes more and more capable," she explained, "the consequences of misuse by hackers will become more severe....Security can really help AI and AI needs security." She then laid out a structured response to challenges at the intersection of the two disciplines, offering examples from her own research into secure and privacy-preserving machine learning solutions.
"One of the fundamental weaknesses of systems is humans," she said, following the observation with an overview of a project that produced an AI-enabled chatbot to monitor correspondence between the user and a third party and identify phishing attempts. She also highlighted the vulnerability of deep learning systems to adversarial examples, demonstrating how attackers could modify traffic signs to confuse self-driving cars even without having any insight into the car's programming.
But far from pessimistic, Song made an effort to depict a future in which machine learning can be less vulnerable and more privacy-preserving. One of her examples, again drawn from her research, was an intelligent and user-controlled virtual assistant that acts as an intermediary when dealing with data-mining third parties such as Google or Facebook. "This will maximize user value," she said, "not corporate value." She ended with a look at her latest venture, Oasis Labs, which is working to create a privacy-first cloud computing platform on blockchain. 
We caught up with Roberto after the lecture, and he spoke highly of Song's ability to look at an issue from all sides: "Her talk eloquently brought together the vast opportunities created by AI and the major challenges in securing its deployment and use."
As the presentation drew to a close, queries from the audience came rapidly, and Song provided answers about secure hardware, the difference between AI and machine learning, and the effectiveness of chatbots against social engineers. The final question, about whether future Oasis Labs releases would work with existing social media platforms or create new ones, brought an answer that seemed to reflect one of the lecture's major themes. Faced with continuing challenges, Song said, she hopes her work will "offer meaningful alternatives" that will bring about both behavioral change and security improvements.
Launched in 2013, the Dennis M. Ritchie Doctoral Dissertation Award was created by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Operating Systems (ACM SIGOPS) to recognize research in software systems and to encourage the creativity that Dennis Ritchie embodied. Only one winner is chosen annually, and this year, Brown CS PhD alum Jonathan Mace, now a tenure-track faculty member at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, received Honorable Mention for the award.
"Many tools for monitoring and enforcing distributed systems," Jonathan explains, "capture information about end-to-end executions by propagating in-band contexts." In his thesis ("A Universal Architecture for Cross-Cutting Tools in Distributed Systems"), he characterizes a broad class of such cross-cutting tools and extends these ideas to new applications in resource management and dynamic monitoring. Finally, he identifies underlying commonalities in this class of tools, and proposes an abstraction layering that simplifies their development, deployment, and reuse.
Jonathan's thesis is available here.
"We have been exposed to new technologies for centuries," says Professor John Savage of Brown CS, "and every time a new technology is introduced, there are dislocations, unanticipated consequences...in our current situation, we have rushed to computerize so many things without knowing the hazards we were creating that we now have to address these problems urgently." 
John goes on to explain his belief that the software being written today is more reliable and secure than earlier efforts, but much of the rapidly-growing Internet of Things is run on highly insecure platforms, requiring a great deal of replacing and rewriting. This observation and others are part of a recent, wide-ranging interview with Savage conducted by Llewellyn King of White House Chronicle, a television program featured nationwide on more than 200 stations that focuses on the pressing issues of the day.
A recording of the entire interview is available here.
Out of more than 700 faculty members, two are chosen each year for Brown University's Presidential Faculty Award, and this semester, President Christina Paxson selected Professor Michael Littman of the Department of Computer Science (Brown CS).
Established in 2013, the Presidential Faculty Award recognizes members of Brown’s distinguished faculty who are conducting especially important and innovative scholarship. Michael is the first Brown CS recipient of the award, and it comes only months after he received the Philip J. Bray Award for Excellence in Teaching in the Physical Sciences. Prior winners of the Presidential Faculty Award include Bonnie Honig (Professor of Modern Culture and Media and Professor of Political Science), Jill Pipher (Elisha Benjamin Andrews Professor of Mathematics and Founding Director of the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics), and David Berson (Sidney A. Fox and Dorothea Doctors Fox Professor of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences).
Michael will receive a research stipend of $5,000 and give a Presidential Faculty Lecture to provide an opportunity for faculty members in other disciplines to learn about his work.
A list of previous winners is available here.
Professor Shriram Krishnamurthi of Brown CS and collaborators have won the annual SIGPLAN Software Award for contributions to the development of the programming language Racket. This award recognizes the development of a software system that has had a significant impact on programming language research and on education, and will be shared with Barzilay, Felleisen (Northeastern University), Findler (Northwestern University), Flatt (University of Utah), McCarthy (University of Massachusetts - Lowell, Brown CS PhD alum), and Tobin-Hochstadt (Indiana University).
In continuous development since 1995, Racket is one of the world’s leading environments for language-oriented programming, elevating a “language” to its own status as a software building block. As a testament to Racket’s rapid and widespread adoption, two of the newest Brown CS faculty members (Professors George Konidaris and Seny Kamara) both used DrScheme, an earlier version of the environment, as undergrads.
Shriram continues to be recognized for his contributions to the field of computer science, with this award coming on the heels of his recent SIGSOFT Influential Educator Award.
VISSOFT 2018, the Sixth IEEE Working Conference on Software Visualization, was held last week in Madrid, Spain, and Professor Steven P. Reiss of Brown CS took home the Most Influential Paper Award for research ("The Paradox of Software Visualization") from 2005. In his paper, Steven raises the question of why software visualization has yet to be successfully deployed in a mainstream development environment, and argues that most past and current work in the field is out of touch with the reality of software development and that new approaches and new ideas are needed.
Session chairs Wim De Pauw and Jonathan Maletic presented the award just before the close of the conference on September 25, and Steve gave a retrospective of his work, declaring that challenges still remain and advocating for embedding visualizations in existing tools and using them to address real problems.
Brown CS is glad to announce that applications are open for the Randy F. Pausch '82 Computer Science Undergraduate Summer Research Award, which provides $10,000 annually to support an undergraduate engaged in an intensive faculty-student summer research partnership with the Department of Computer Science.
Last year, the award went to Nathaniel Weir, who who used the funds to explore a deep learning approach to Natural Language Interfaces for Databases (NLIDBs).
To apply, no later than February 10, 2019, students should email Associate Professor (Research) and Vice Chair Tom Doeppner either: (A) a copy of their summer UTRA application or (B) a two-page description of their proposed research and a letter of support from the Brown CS faculty member that they intend to work with.
Professor Jennifer Rexford of Princeton University visited the CIT last week to address Brown CS and deliver the thirty-sixth lecture ("Hitting the Nail on the Head: Interdisciplinary Research in Computer Networking") in the Distinguished Lecture Series. Expanding on the metaphor of hammers (the honed skills of researchers in established disciplines) and nails (interesting and important problems), she took her audience through what she described as a career in rethinking the foundations of how we manage networks, through the entire "control loop" of measurement, analysis, and control.
Working chronologically, Rexford looked closely at three example projects: optimization theory to derive distributed network protocols, composition of network policies, and traffic monitoring in network hardware. In the first section, an offhand remark that "for some reason, it wasn't obvious at first that network protocols should be solving a well-defined problem" brought knowing laughter from the audience, and they listened carefully to comments on topics such as the new understanding of modularity's importance in networking and the need to favor the concrete instead of the abstract and design iteratively. 
At the end of the lecture, offering best practices and "hard-won" lessons learned, Rexford struck a balance between caution and enthusiasm. "Real problems are often interdisciplinary," she said, explaining that interdisciplinary work and its striving for impact can be intellectually exciting and enjoyable, but also dangerous for junior collaborators who haven't mastered their own hammer. Her advice? Start with your hammer: "It's easier for a programming languages person to learn part of networking than a networking person to learn programming languages." Join an emerging community, she recommended but be careful not to be too late, and seek out collaborators who are physically proximal, stay engaged, and have similar values.
We caught up with Professor Shriram Krishnamurthi after the lecture. He says, "Jen Rexford, or 'J-Rex' to her friends and admirers, is an awesome creature of prodigious powers. Whenever she arrives at a new networking problem area, weak ideas and poor foundations tremble before her might. Her oeuvre is characterized by beautiful and powerful results, but unlike a T-Rex, she also deserves credit for her open mind and welcoming nature, which has made the networking tent a lot larger than it might otherwise have been." 
Fittingly, the final note of the lecture was a positive one as Rexford praised networking's important, real-world challenges and intellectually rich space of problems: "The Internet is still in its infancy and we need to create systems worthy of the trust we place in them....There's a grand challenge across fields if we can reach across the divide."
SIGGRAPH, a special interest group for the Association for Computing Machinery, is one of the world’s largest communities of researchers, artists, developers, and filmmakers dedicated to the advancement of computer graphics and interactive techniques. Their Awards Committee has recently announced that Professor Andy van Dam of Brown University’s Department of Computer Science  (Brown CS) has been named to the ACM SIGGRAPH Academy, an honorary group of individuals known for contributions to the field of computer graphics as well as impact through research directives and innovations.
"It's a great honor to be in the first class of inductees into the SIGGRAPH Academy. When in 1967 I co-founded SICGRAPH, the precursor to SIGGRAPH, computer graphics wasn't even recognized as a specialty within the then new field of CS, and now SIGGRAPH is the dominant Special Interest Group in ACM, running the largest annual conference. And the Visual Computing Group in our department has six faculty and a senior lecturer, as many people as founded our department in 1979!", he says. Already recognized by the ACM as a pioneer in the field of graphics (previously winning the ACM Karl V. Karlstrom Outstanding Educator Award, and the ACM SIGGRAPH Steven A. Coons Award), Andy continues to innovate in the computer graphics realm.
The Department of Computer Science at Brown University seeks applicants for multiple faculty positions at the rank of lecturer, senior lecturer, or distinguished senior lecturer. The initial appointment would be for a 3-year period (renewable with potential for promotion and longer-term contracts). These positions are a part of a major expansion plan for the department as it plans to increase its roster by 50% over the next five years.
These positions involve teaching four undergraduate courses per year and advising undergraduate CS majors. At least some of the teaching would be in first- and second-year courses. Candidates will also teach some upper-level undergraduate courses, based on their expertise and department needs. The department seeks candidates who will contribute to its overall intellectual culture; lecturers are included in faculty meetings, advise undergraduate research projects, and participate in graduate research with the rest of the faculty. Lecturers with substantial research participation and supporting funds may be eligible for periodic course
release. The department values teaching and educational innovation, and welcomes candidates interested in formally researching computing education in the context of their teaching. Brown offers a vibrant community for both teaching and research, with 33 tenured and tenure- track faculty members, one lecturer, three research faculty and several adjunct and visiting faculty members (with additional hiring planned over the next few years). The department has a strong undergraduate culture, anchored by a mature, endowed program for undergraduate teaching assistants, as well as a long history of published undergraduate research. Research and graduate programs leverage disciplinary strengths in CS as well as Brown’s broader interdisciplinary culture. CS is a founding partner in multiple university-wide initiatives including Data Science, Computational and Molecular Biology, Cybersecurity, and Human-Centered Robotics.
The positions are expected to start in the fall of 2019. In selecting candidates, we will consider quality of teaching, evidence of effective teaching, and compatibility with the area needs and interests of the department, as well as potential for effective participation in department or university activities and committees. For all applicants, we will consider potential for impact beyond Brown (through teaching, research, significant system building, outreach, or other professional activities, as appropriate for the candidate).
Applicants must have a Ph.D. by the start of the position. Applicants must submit a CV, a teaching statement, and an additional statement describing either research or other significant professional activities beyond classroom instruction (as appropriate for the candidate’s background and interests). Candidates must also arrange for at least three letters of reference to be submitted through the application website.

What does the future hold at the intersection of machine learning and computational biology? A conversation with the newest member of the Brown CS and Center for Molecular Computational Biology (CCMB) faculty provides an opportunity to ask an expert.
"I can't tell you whether it'll be five years, ten years, or whenever," says Ritambhara Singh, who joins us as Assistant Professor next year, "but in my head I have a perfect picture of how they'll fit together. A patient will walk into a clinic, provide a blood sample, and based on computational analysis of it, we'll help her doctor reduce the number of possible diagnoses and decide on the best treatment. At the moment, we have genetic diseases and we have treatments, but we don't know enough about why these diseases occur. At some point, the link will be made. At least, that's the utopia I have in mind!"
Before we leave the topic of the future, Ritambhara mentions something else that she wants to see in the days ahead. "I'm a very big promoter of women in STEM fields," she says. "It's something that I want to work on at Brown – I think a focus on the next generation of women scientists is really important, and I'm excited about hopefully inspiring women."
Excitement was a part of Singh's experience with computers long before she wrote her first line of code. Compared to the United States, she explains, personal computers were introduced to India quite late, and her parents didn't buy one until she was in the sixth grade. An eleven-year-old Ritambhara went to uncommon lengths to pursue CS studies from the very beginning, signing up for a computer class that her parents required before making the purchase. But afterward? "It was amazing," she says. "I was the only one in my family who knew how to use it, so I had this privileged status." 
After high school, computer science was the clear choice for a major even though Ritambhara hadn't done a great deal of coding yet. "It was a bit of a struggle at first," she says, "but once I got the hang of it, it was addictive." The experience of suddenly looking up and finding herself eight hours into working on a project was a common one, and the four years went by quickly.
The time that followed at University of Virginia (a Master's and then a PhD) were full of career-defining choices. "I wasn't sure what to study," Ritambhara says, "but my father is a doctor and I've always been interested in biology, so I thought computational biology would be a good fit." Once again, she found herself putting in extra effort by taking supplementary biology courses while working with Professor Mazhar Adli, a biochemist.
Professor Yanjun Qi, a machine learning (ML) expert, arrived at UVA in 2013, and Ritambhara saw the chance to combine ML with computational biology. "I'm so happy that I decided to take the risk," she says. "Machine learning was such a good fit because one person cannot make sense of the large amounts of data in biology. There was a bit of a learning curve, but I really enjoyed it. If there's something that excites me in a topic, I enjoy the learning process."
The collaborations that were so formative for her research are a big part of what made Ritambhara choose Brown CS: "The setup at Brown is an amazing collaborative space. Biologists are excited about computer science, and vice-versa. Brown is unique, and there are so many bright minds and great opportunities. It was wonderful to see how excited people were about my research. Being in academia gives me the freedom to try new approaches and truly experiment and explore."
"Both the Center for Computational Molecular Biology and CS communities at Brown were extremely impressed with Ritambhara's research talk and our one-on-one interactions with her," says Sohini Ramachandran, Associate Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Associate Professor of Computer Science, and Director of the Center for Computational Molecular Biology. "She fielded questions from colleagues in Biology and CS with aplomb, and the Computational Biology graduate students all remarked on the thoughtful interest she showed in their research. I think she will fit right into the ethos at Brown, where we see all community members as people we can learn from, and where interdisciplinary work is highly valued."
How does Ritambhara describe her work? "My research involves developing and applying machine learning algorithms and models to understand data in biology. We all have the basic building blocks of DNA, but our environment plays a huge part in whether a cell stays healthy or becomes diseased. To start making sense of all the data we gather, we need to experiment. Machine learning helps us design experiments more intelligently, looking through the data to see if our hypotheses were correct and hopefully discovering which features may have caused the gene expression that turns a normal cell into a cancerous one."
"One of the main ideas that I see in computational biology," she says, "is that with every problem we work on, we hope to eventually help people. In the beginning, computational biologists had such a long road ahead of them because they first had to understand what was happening genetically. Then, we spent a great deal of time gathering data. It's exciting to finally be acting on all that knowledge that we've gathered, using machine learning to help. The point isn't just collecting data, it's ultimately helping people." 
An unexamined life may or may not be worth living, but it's clear that Tim Nelson, who has just been promoted to Brown CS Assistant Professor (Research), isn't leading one. In an hour-long interview, his reflections on our field repeatedly evoke the challenges that almost all students face in their early days of CS. His conversation finds links and commonalities and equidistant points: between math and computer science, between formal methods and programmers like the one he once was, and especially between Tim and his students. And it reveals a love of helping people escape fixed mindsets, perhaps through a process of discovery similar to his own.
Asked about his earliest interest in computers, Tim starts with what he sees as one of the core challenges of the field. "One of our problems," he says, "is that some people who study computer science receive more support than others. My parents encouraged me and made a lot of sacrifices, and when I was young, I never considered that other people wouldn't have the same. Lacking that reinforcement from family and friends –or having it and being overconfident, without awareness of how it affects others– can cause talented students to leave any field."
Partially because of that support, which kept him motivated even after failing a first-year programming class, Tim graduated from community college (Diablo Valley College in Pleasant Hill, California) at an age when most kids were finishing high school. After a move to Massachusetts at age 18, he started looking for a software job.
He found one at a company that made fiduciary tax software for estates and trusts. It was a grind, he says, an environment without much testing infrastructure where a build would be finished only hours before it needed to be ready, then frantically put into production: "You don't need a computer science degree to program, it's true, but my lack of fundamentals hurt me. I was just hacking desperately at that point, trying to stay afloat. For example, I had to write a parser, but had never been taught to build one properly, and so it took me ages and ended up buggy. I'm still recovering from some of the toxic aspects of programmer culture. But it taught me a real respect for testing, validation, and verification."
Eventually laid off, Tim describes the year of unemployment that followed as one of the best things that ever happened to him, providing the opportunity to complete a Bachelor's degree in computer science at Worcester State University. Inspired by hearing Brown CS Professor Andy van Dam speak at a conference, Tim applied to Brown, but was rejected. ("I wasn't prepared," he explains.) He chose Worcester Polytechnic Institute instead, where he worked with Daniel J. Dougherty and Kathi Fisler, now Professor (Research) and Director of the Brown CS Undergraduate Program. After learning of Tim's work from Kathi, Brown CS Professor Shriram Krishnamurthi took notice, acting as an informal advisor. Eventually, the association led to postdoctoral work at Brown.
"Research at Brown," Tim notes, "puts students in what's often called a 'high-octane' environment. I prefer to instead say 'high-energy'. Collaboration is such an important part of research, and I love that I get to work with and learn from wonderful, smart people who add energy and inspiration to the process every day. The positive energy and collegiality are the real benefits of the environment here."
Tim's research is in an area called formal methods, which uses mathematical techniques to reason about systems. "Formal logic isn't just a philosophical topic. It has real applications in computing, for real-world professionals," Tim says. "For instance, some cloud-services providers have been using logic to help customers verify security goals for years now. And these customers aren't logicians: they're working programmers and sysadmins! It's an exciting time to be in the field and see academic ideas find industrial application." 
One of the most important things Shriram offered, Tim says, was the chance to be mentored while co-teaching CSCI 1950-Y Logic for Systems: "I was very lucky to land a postdoc at a place where I wasn't told to do research and shut up. Shriram built this entire opportunity for me, sitting in class with his laptop and taking notes while I taught. Taking the time to mentor a postdoc in teaching – who does that? I owe him a great deal."
"In designing the course," says Tim, "we work really hard to find a balance of accessibility and rigor, and we change a third or more of the class every year. My goal is to teach every student enough so that if they end up in a job that's FM-adjacent, they'll think, 'Oh, hey, I can do this!'"
It seems to be working. Brown CS alum Louisa Conwill writes, "Learning computer science and how to program taught me a completely new way of thinking and reasoning. However, Logic for Systems built on, challenged, and stretched my reasoning skills by taking them a step farther – instead of learning how to solve computer science problems and build computer systems, in Logic for Systems I learned how to analyze those very problems and systems." Despite the fact that it doesn't focus on a trendy research area or feature an instructor who's a legend in their field, it's one of the largest upper-level undergraduate courses at Brown CS. Tim says that he'll happily teach it as long as he's allowed to.
What's next in the world of formal methods? "There's a motto in programming: 'move fast and break things'. But of course we can't leave them broken! What this really means that we should fix things quickly," Tim argues. "Formal methods give chaotic innovators a safety net." He returns to something that he's mentioned earlier, the need to change perspective: "Formal methods lead programmers to fix bugs, often before the bugs make it into code. Formalism, assurance, and proof don't have to be at odds with mainstream hacker culture."
In the years ahead, Tim is eager to work simultaneously on teaching and research, enjoying how they feed from and give ideas to each other. He's also looking forward to teaching CSCI 00320 Software Engineering and continuing to develop his skills as an advisor, both in terms of Brown's curriculum but also in research as well. Tim has a history of involving undergraduates in his projects, and he cites several that went on to be published: work on programing languages, firewall verification, network monitoring, and software engineering. "Working with Brown students is a real blessing," he says. "It's not just about writing code I tell them to write – the best students engage with the research itself."
And what would he say to those young computer scientists that he'll be advising? The question brings Tim full circle, and he thinks for a long time. "It's about changing mindsets again. CS has a unique role in our changing economy, and we should be aware of how our field impacts jobs – both positively and negatively. But more importantly, as the nature of work changes, where do we derive meaning?I believe in the ennobling power of work, not in the clichéd sense of being forced to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, but as a way to have an impact. How will we help people see that service is a calling? For me, teaching is how I have an influence and how I make things better."
"These are kids who would never have seen a real robotics lab otherwise," says Annalisa Marchessault, Pre-Engineering Instructor at Providence Career and Technical Academy (PCTA), one of New England's premier technical high schools. "Many of them don't even realize the magnitude of what Stefanie has done for them."
She's talking about Professor Stefanie Tellex of Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS), whose four-year outreach effort with the school's students has produced some inspiring results. Jose Toribio, one of the program's alums, is not only studying robotics but helping teach it to the next generation of students.
Now almost a decade old, Providence Career and Technical Academy allows students to choose a particular area of technology and then pursue their studies with a mix of internships and classwork. Computer science has always been a popular subject, and four years ago, Annalisa's predecessor approached Stefanie with a request that Tellex share her robotics work with PCTA students in the Engineering program.
The response was surprising: along with giving a talk, Tellex invited students to come and work with drones and robots in her Humans To Robots lab during the summer. "What makes Stefanie amazing is that she's so approachable," Annalisa says. "She reaches out, she wants everyone to learn, and nothing could have been better than giving our kids an opportunity to learn like this locally, working alongside Brown students." 
Jose Toribio was part of Stefanie's second cohort. For someone with a lifelong interest in computers, the Humans To Robots lab was filled with exciting possibilities. He says, "I liked how open the program was. If I came up with an idea, everyone was ready to think about how it could be achieved." Jose mentions that giving public demonstrations of drones he'd built with fellow students was one of the things he enjoyed most. (One of his demos was recently seen by Richard M. Locke, Brown's Provost.) "At one of them," he remembers, "I met someone from Google who was from Providence, someone just like us. It was really exciting to feel that connection to her." 
Maybe part of the excitement was because Jose was beginning to think about being a role model himself. After completing his second summer with Stefanie's lab, he ran the program for the five juniors and seniors who joined the following year, and accepted Annalisa's offer to serve as PCTA's Robotics Coach. This summer, he taught a high school course as part of Summer@Brown and mentored two high school students doing paid internships with Stefanie's lab.
"It's wonderful to see Jose's eagerness to share knowledge," Stefanie says. "He's the sort of person that when he first came into the lab, he immediately started showing another high school student how to solder. PCTA students have been a strong asset in hardware design and creating documentation for the course for the high school level.  I'm excited to continue working with them as our project grows!"
Now studying computer science at Rhode Island College, Jose says that it's a chance to revisit the important high school years that passed by so quickly: "It's incredible to see the next generation of students doing what I did. I love being able to share my experience and show them different ways to look at an experiment." When he graduates, he's hoping to move to a bigger city and continue his engineering work, particularly in the area of robotic vision. "I just want to thank Stefanie and Annalisa," Jose says. "Without them, I might be programming, but I'd never have had this chance to work up close with robots." 
Annalisa expects that there are big things in store for him. "Two of the most amazing things about this program," she says, "are Jose and Stefanie themselves. For kids in Jose's position, seeing how he wanted to go and learn, then come back and volunteer, is the coolest thing. He's someone like them, so they feel comfortable, and they see that everything he's done is attainable for them. And Stefanie doesn't have to do what she does, but she always makes the time. Thanks to her, these kids have seen possibilities for their lives that they'd never known about." 
Imagine that you're the Chief of Surgery for a major hospital. Dozens of patients are being operated on every day, using a variety of techniques. If you wanted to find out which surgery was most effective on patients with similar problems, you might start with their medical records, looking at things like post-surgery pain levels and how long each patient needed to recover. With the right analysis, you might see clear benefits to a particular approach, thus improving the lives of thousands of future patients.
There's only one problem: even though the medical records are electronic, most of the information you need doesn't come from a check box or the answer to a multiple-choice question. It's in the free text fields where your doctors have written notes that are unstandardized and idiosyncratic to say the least. You could use machine learning to extract that information, but you need labeled training data, or data that's been tagged with meaningful information to learn from. Especially in fields like medicine, crowdsourcing training data at this scale is impossible.
So you decide to call Stephen Bach (he's joining Brown CS as Assistant Professor this fall) and ask him about Snorkel, which he describes as a training data creation and management system for machine learning.
"In order to find the subtle patterns in a data set that humans don't see," he explains, "we need to label the data, but if humans are doing the labeling, it's expensive and challenging, so Snorkel uses weakly supervised machine learning to shrink the human effort needed. You can't ask someone to write a million labels, but one of our developers can write ten functions that describe the task and label the data programmatically. The results are often noisy and contradictory, but Snorkel models the labeling functions statistically, to learn which are better than others, and then applies them to train a high-quality end model."
Only two years old, Snorkel is already being used by dozens of organizations around the world, ranging from Alibaba Group and Intel to DARPA, Stanford Medicine, and the District Attorney of New York County. With all of these uses for the software, it's tempting to ask Stephen what's in store for the project, which data sets are next in line to give up their secrets. But let's start at the beginning.
"I was always interested in computers," Stephen says, "but even starting college, I didn't understand what computer science was about, how much breadth there was and how many new, open questions." He'd planned to be an economist, but couldn't fit an economics course in his first-semester schedule at Georgetown University, so he took a CS class to fulfill one of his requirements. And got hooked.
Spurred on by an initial interest in artificial intelligence, Stephen began doing undergraduate research, including multiple summer fellowships. He recommends it to anyone: "They really gave me a taste of how different research was from coursework, the whole idea of learning how to approach open questions." One of his early goals was using automation to reduce tedious, routine tasks that are a burden to researchers. And as a fascination with machine learning grew, he became interested in the idea of helping people make discoveries, providing tools for use by scientists in other domains.
Working toward his doctorate at the University of Maryland, Stephen became interested in one of AI's oldest debates: logical methods such as programming and first-order logic versus statistics, which asks computers to deal with the uncertainty and ambiguity of data. "Scientists have gone back and forth because of the trade-offs between the two," he explains. "We're great at symbolic reasoning but not at estimating uncertainty, and I wanted to help people by combining the advantages of both approaches."
Hearing that, it's easy to see how Snorkel, which Stephen co-created with colleagues at Stanford University while doing postdoctoral research, was a logical next step. Will his work with the project continue here at Brown CS? "Absolutely. I want to keep going, and I want to work with people in other fields, not just computer scientists. Brown's culture is such a great place for that. And I want to invest time in validating applications, making sure they're really useful. Students at Brown are going to have their own real-world applications for weakly supervised machine learning, and they're the kind of people I really want to work with."
This fall, Stephen will be teaching a seminar (CSCI 2952-C Learning with Limited Labeled Data), and in the spring, CSCI 1420 Machine Learning, which explores the theory and practice of statistical machine learning, focusing on computational methods for supervised and unsupervised data analysis. "I'm eager to hit the ground running," he says, "with my teaching and with working on some new problems shaped by what we learned on the Snorkel project. We've used machine reading to find facts in text, but now I’m interested in new ways to extend our techniques. Code-as-supervision in areas like video and computer vision, is a big, open challenge. I also want to look at managing the process of having models train other models for different tasks."
What he finds exciting about machine learning, Stephen says, is that it can have tremendous indirect effects: "Doctors making better surgical decisions is a great example of how we can all benefit from ML discoveries. Just managing the increasing complexity of our lives is going to become incredibly important, like smarter personal assistants that will manage our schedules and summarize all the information we don’t have to time to look at. The joy of machine learning is that we can help people live more pleasant and productive lives if we do it right."
Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) has made it our mission to create and sustain a diverse and inclusive environment in which all students, faculty, and staff can thrive. Few things are more meaningful than to see our female students become known leaders and role models in the field, and Brown CS undergraduate Natalie Reed has just received significant recognition: she's been named a Women Techmakers Scholar. The award is part of Google's Women Techmakers Scholars Program, which aims at furthering Anita Borg’s vision of creating gender equality in the field of computer science.
2018 is the ninth year in which a Brown CS student has either received the scholarship (formerly known as the Google Anita Borg Memorial Scholarship) or been a finalist, and it's the seventh year in a row. Students previously recognized include Tiffany Chen (Scholar) in 2017; Julia Wu (Scholar) in 2016; Sharon Lo (Scholar) and Danaë Metaxa-Kakavouli (Scholar) in 2015; Molly Long (Scholar), Layla Oesper (Scholar), and Eden Weizman (Scholar) in 2014; Irina Calciu (Finalist) in 2013; Jessica Lu (Finalist) in 2012; Theresa Avitabile (Scholar) in 2010; and Lucia Ballard (Scholar) in 2005.
GWT Scholars receive recognition and support for their education as they become part of the next generation of diverse tech leaders. This includes a visit to Google's Scholars Retreat in Mountain View, California, filled with tech talks, networking opportunities, developmental activities and sessions, and social activities with the other Scholars.
The Very Large Databases (VLDB) Conference, one of the most prominent venues for research and development results in the field of database management, will be held in Rio de Janeiro this year, from August 27 to August 31. It's still a month away, but the Awards Committee has already announced that Adjunct Associate Professor (formerly Assistant Professor) Tim Kraska of Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) has won the VLDB Early Career Research Contribution Award.
Already honored multiple times for his early career achievements (most recently, Brown's Early Career Research Achievement Award and the VMware Early Career Systems Research Award), this award recognizes Tim for advancing systems research on interactive data analytics.
Thanks to a grant from General Motors, Bootstrap (a K-12 CS curriculum used worldwide that's directed by Kathi Fisler, Shriram Krishnamurthi, and Emmanuel Schanzer of Brown CS) has begun training dozens of educators to teach the new Bootstrap:Data Science module. Working with longtime regional partners WeTeach_CS and the University of Texas, Bootstrap will deliver four-day workshops from July of 2018 to June of 2020 for teachers in the Austin Independent School District.
After being trained, the educators will be able to deliver the new module, which gives students the opportunity to form their own questions about the world around them, analyze data using multiple methods, and write a research paper about their findings. Topics covered include functions, looping and iteration, data visualization, linear regression, and more. Social studies, science, and business teachers can utilize the module to help students make inferences from data, math teachers can use it to introduce foundational concepts in statistics, and it's aligned to the Data standards in CS Principles.
In addition to funding the workshop and classroom materials for teachers and students alike, GM's support will allow Bootstrap to study the implementation of the module alongside their external evaluator in order to iterate and improve in subsequent years. 
PhD alum Justin Pombrio and Professor Shriram Krishnamurthi of Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) have received the PLDI 2018 Distinguished Artifact Award. PLDI (the ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation) is a leading forum in the field of programming languages and programming systems research, and the award recognizes the artifact ("SweetT: Resugaring Type Systems") accompanying a paper ("Inferring Type Rules for Syntactic Sugar") that Justin presented at the conference.
Pombrio and Krishnamurthi explain that type systems and syntactic sugar are both valuable, but are sometimes at odds, causing problems for programmers. Their research addresses these problems by presenting a process for automatically reconstructing type rules for the surface language using the type rules of the core language.  
How does it work? SweetT takes as input:
and produces a set of type rules for the sugars.
This is the second award that Justin and Shriram have received for their collaborations: two years ago, their work with desugaring and resugaring ("Hygienic Resugaring of Compositional Desugaring") was selected as one of ACM SIGPLAN ICFP's best papers.
The artifact ("SweetT: Resugaring Type Systems") is available here and the paper ("Inferring Type Rules for Syntactic Sugar") is available here.
Pedro Felzenszwalb, Professor of Engineering and Computer Science at Brown University, has just received the 2018 Longuet-Higgins Prize for fundamental contributions in computer vision. The prize recognizes work in Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) from ten years ago, Felzenszwalb’s 2008 paper ("A Discriminatively Trained, Multiscale, Deformable Part Model") with David McAllester and Deva Ramanan.
The prize is given annually by the Technical Committee on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TCPAMI) at the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, and recognizes CVPR papers from ten years ago with significant impact on computer vision research. The prize is named after theoretical chemist and cognitive scientist H. Christopher Longuet-Higgins. Winners are decided by a committee appointed by the TCPAMI Awards Committee.
The prize was first awarded in 2005, and Felzenszwalb is among a select group of repeat winners. He previously won in 2010 for his 2000 paper ("Efficient Matching of Pictorial Structures") with Daniel P. Huttenlocher.
A new article from MIT Technology Review examines work from Professor Stefanie Tellex and PhD student David Whitney of Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS), who are using augmented reality as a means to help humans and robots work together better in real environments.
The full story and a video are available here.
Professor Shriram Krishnamurthi of Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) has just received the SIGSOFT Influential Educator Award. Presented annually, it's given to an educator or educators who have made significant contributions to, and impact on, the field of software engineering through accomplishments as teachers, mentors, researchers (in education or learning), authors, and/or policy makers. In particular, the award committee noted Shriram's contributions to the advancement of the research and practice of software engineering.
The award is international recognition of continued strength in education at Brown CS, and it follows recent awards for three faculty members and one PhD student that highlight campus-wide recognition of the Department's teaching excellence. It comes less than halfway into a busy year in which Shriram has already given keynote addresses at Programming 2018 and elsewhere, written a cover story for Communications of the ACM, and been appointed to co-lead the CACM Research Highlights Editorial Board. With this win, he joins Brown alum Barbara Ryder and the late David Notkin, a Brown CS alum, who won the prestigious award in 2015 and 2012, respectively.
The full list of winners dating back to 2009 is available here.
Brown University's Alfred H. Joslin Joslin Awards recognize a small group of seniors who have contributed in a very significant way to the quality of student life at Brown, enhancing the learning environment for all students by providing their peers with services, programs, and other opportunities for involvement. This year, one of the winners was Brown CS student Chelse-Amoy Steele, who recently graduated with a joint concentration in Computer Science and Africana Studies.
Out of numerous achievements (President of the Undergraduate Council of Students, multiple teaching assistantships, spearheading Project Tampon, contributions to a free textbook initiative, and activism work with accountability and institutional bias), Chelse cites Mosaic+ as the creation she's most proud of during her time in Providence. The student-led initiative aims to create a receptive and equitable space for racially underrepresented minority students and faculty at Brown CS, and Chelse describes it as the best example of the focus on diversity and access to resources that's been the center of her student experience.
"The spirit we started with," she says, "had activism at its core. We wanted to be in community and work together with folks who looked like us, not just improve numbers but take proactive measures to secure a sense of belonging for underrepresented folks in the department. That meant that we needed to look at who was missing and not just include them compositionally, but make space for them in all facets of Brown CS. Our goal was to start a conversation, to really change the tide." 
Now that other students will be taking the Mosaic+ helm, Chelse says she's eager to see how Brown CS will continue to take a proactive stance and implement the Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan that she helped create: "We were students in the Department who felt forgotten. It took us boldly speaking up and acknowledging our experiences –and the inequities that created them– as consequential in order for change to happen. I'm proud of the work that we did and am proud of the students who will be leading the organization as we leave. I hope that when they bring forth new issues students are facing, they'll be heard and responded to, but more than anything, this experience has taught me that response is not enough. It is important to proactively see and understand the needs of folks who are often not thought of. I hope that Brown CS, folks in industry, research, and even at other institutions will continue to nurture this work – not solely in response to crises, but through conditioning themselves to be more critical and thoughtful in regards to the needs and experiences of underrepresented students." 
Modestly describing herself as a "do what needs to be done" person, Chelse is also looking forward to her new career at Microsoft, where she's accepted a position as a Product Manager in their Educational Products division, which produces software such as Immersive Reader and OneNote Class Notebook. There's little doubt she'll be putting to use the energy and creative powers that helped earn her Joslin Award.
"It's not a stretch to see certain needs – to know that there is an issue," she says. "Figuring out how to address it is the hard part. I'm proud of the creativity of the interventions that I've been a part of and hope that when I come back to visit Brown CS, the world the next generations of leaders of Mosaic+, the Diversity Advocates, WiCS, and the Mental Health Advocates create will continue to be one of excellence, rigorous criticism, and passionate activism!" 
One of the most widely-used texts on designing computer programs has just been republished. A second edition of How to Design Programs, which Professor Shriram Krishnamurthi of Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) co-authored with Matthias Felleisen, Robert Bruce Findler, and Matthew Flatt, is now available in print and online. The book, originally published in 2001, has been used at numerous colleges and universities, ranging as widely as Canada, Chile, Germany, and Israel.
How to Design Programs is notable for its placement of computer science at the center of a liberal arts education. Its focus is on the design process in its entirety, walking the learner through analyzing problem statements, formulating goals, creating examples, outlining, finishing a program, and testing it. Instead of using an off-the-shelf programming language, the book offers the unique feature of a custom-designed programming environment, DrRacket, which supports new learners with carefully-designed feedback. As the reader's skills increase, more and more of the environment is revealed, and they arrive at the end of the book with a fully-fledged language applicable to a wide variety of tasks.
The result of a complete revision, the new edition introduces different design recipes for interactive programs with graphical interfaces and batch programs and provides many new hints to assist the learner. It also provides support for images as plain values, testing, event-driven programming, and distributed programming.
With cryptocurrency and cybersecurity issues continuing to make daily news (just yesterday, genealogy site MyHeritage announced a data breach of more than 92 million users), Professor John Savage of Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) has been sharing his technical and policy expertise on the world stage. Last month, he served on the Socio-economic Aspects of Blockchain and Crypto panel of the ninth annual Asian Leadership Conference in Seoul, South Korea, which chose "Globalization in Crisis: Navigating the World with New Opportunities" as its theme.
Other panelists included Ben Banerjee (Co-founder and Board Member of Swiss Impact Investment Association (SIIA) and the Board of Councilors at East West Institute and Climate Leadership Coalition), Amir Dossal (President and CEO at Global Partnerships Forum / Former United Nations Chief Liaison for Partnerships), and Jason Hsu (Crypto Congressman and Legislator of Taiwan). Sponsored by Chosunilbo, one of the three largest South Korean daily newspapers, the Asian Leadership Conference draws global leaders, policymakers, and top academics from around the world, who come together to discuss and provide possible solutions for the pressing issues facing Asia today. This year's conference had approximately 3,000 attendees.
Associate Professor (Research) Tom Doeppner, Vice Chair of Brown University's Computer Science Department (Brown CS), has been chosen by Brown's graduating senior class to receive the Barrett Hazeltine Citation. The other recipient was Monica Linden, Senior Lecturer in Neuroscience. Named for a beloved professor emeritus, the annual award recognizes excellence in teaching, guidance, and support by two members of the faculty and/or administration. Writing to Tom, a member of the award committee says, "As the person who writes the text of the citations and spends a couple of days culling through student submitted nominations, I have to tell you how much your students appreciate you, and how much of an impact you have made on them."
Tom is the second Brown CS recipient of the award, following Professor Paul Valiant, who was honored in 2016. He was recognized at the President's Reception for the class, and he joins numerous notable prior recipients, including award-winning author James Morone, Barbara Tannenbaum of the Department of Theatre Arts and Performance Studies, and Michael Lysaght, founder and director emeritus of Brown University’s Center for Biomedical Engineering.
Brown University’s Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) is announcing one of its most significant milestones of the past four decades: the full funding of a $10M Undergraduate Teaching Assistant (UTA) Endowment. “We’re immensely grateful to the more than 500 donors who have helped us reach that ambitious goal, and to the group of alums who led the campaign,” says Ugur Çetintemel, Professor and Brown CS Department Chair. “Our UTA program, in place since 1965, has allowed literally thousands of undergraduates to contribute to all aspects of instruction and play a mentoring role that's vital to the quality of coursework, the educational experience of their peers, and their own personal growth.”
“I’d like to start,” Ugur says, “by thanking the campaign committee and Brown CS staff for their hard work and incredible dedication: John Bazik, Marc Brown, Karen Catlin, Lauren Clarke, Tom Doeppner, Aisha Ferrazares, Tashana Landray, Ed Lazowska, Adam Leventhal, Daniel Leventhal, Norm Meyrowitz, Jesse Polhemus, Will Poole, Brad Silverberg, Andy van Dam, and Jeff Vogel. This campaign was a success because of Norm’s tremendous leadership, and I’m grateful for Ed’s continuing contributions and Lauren’s many, many hours of hard work. I’d also like to thank President Christina Paxson and Provost Richard Locke, who helped launch this project and gave it the final push that it needed, and Brown’s Division of Advancement for their support.”
One of the signature elements of the campaign was its use of crowdfunding, including a website that enabled people to donate and watch a “scoreboard” that showed progress toward the goal in real time. Gifts ranged from $5 to $1,000,000, creating a mosaic of donors that includes alums and friends of all ages, numerous professions, and many different life experiences.
Some donors formed affinity groups, such as the Women of CS ‘83, ‘84, and ‘85, creating UTAships whose name reflects their graduation year, or ones that honor or memorialize someone special. Not only will their tributes last as long as Brown CS does, showing appreciation for such people as Tom Doeppner, Doreen Green, Marie Moses, Randy Pausch, and Andy van Dam, many of the UTAships are designated for women or underrepresented minorities, helping add to the diversity of the Brown CS community. In the end, more than 500 gifts have funded 4 Meta UTAships, close to 20 Head UTAships, and close to 200 UTAships each year.
“We’re thrilled that the UTA program will continue to thrive and benefit new generations of students,” remarks Professor Andy van Dam, who started the program 53 years ago, “and our UTAs feel the same,” Meta-TA Zach Kirschenbaum, who maintains he’ll always be a CS 15 Humor TA, says, “The UTA program means a lot more to me than grading and debugging code. It’s about the sense of community with your staff, the ownership you have over a course, and the feeling of reward you get when a student has that ‘aha’ moment – it’s what keeps me coming back semester after semester. I’m extremely grateful for having the opportunity to serve as a UTA and MTA, and I’m excited for others to have the same opportunity.”
The UTA program has always been one of the cornerstones of Brown CS and its undergraduate student experience. “It turned out to be a game changer,” says alum Karen Catlin. “Being a UTA made me feel like I belonged. I loved being part of the Brown CS community, hanging out after hours with other undergrads and grad students, getting to know faculty and staff, and contributing to the success of CS courses. And the sense of community was especially important to me, a newbie to coding. I thrived because of it.”
The UTA program has expanded as Brown CS has grown, but in recent years, due to soaring enrollment and new federal employment regulations, it’s become dramatically more expensive. At the moment, more than one in six students at Brown is a CS concentrator, requiring up to 50 UTAs in some classes and a total of over 250 per semester, with more than 300 expected in the fall. At the same time, Brown faces increased budget pressure because of its admirable need-blind, no-loan financial aid policy. This endowment helps ensure that this one-of-a-kind program will operate at its current level for years to come.
As the academic year drew to a close, Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) held its fourth Undergraduate Computer Science Research Symposium, organized by Professors Jeff Huang and Stefanie Tellex and undergraduate students Marshall Lerner, Jina Yoon, and Alan Yu. The annual event features presentations of student research with the goal of showcasing cutting-edge work and encouraging other undergraduates to undertake research projects of their own.
A total of two thousand dollars in prizes was generously donated by sponsors Amazon Robotics and Bulger Partners.
The Randy F. Pausch '82 Computer Science Undergraduate Summer Research Award, given this year to Nathaniel Weir to support his work with Professor and Department Chair Ugur Çetintemel, recognizes strong achievement from young students and offers them the opportunity to partner with faculty and advance work that began in the Brown CS undergraduate research program.
Nathaniel's project, he explains, explores a deep learning approach to Natural Language Interfaces for Databases (NLIDBs). "We're building a user-friendly interface," he says, "for interaction with a relational database management system (RDBMS) without requiring prior knowledge of SQL or the specifics of database schemas. It should be able to respond to any natural language query of the database with the proper table of requested information. Our project attempts to solve a number of current challenges of pertinence to the database and natural language processing communities. These include database independence, vocabulary robustness, stateful conversationality, and the ability to respond to complicated or comprehensive requests that involve difficult database operations or multi-level nested queries."
"It feels amazing to be recognized for this kind of work," Nathaniel says. "Natural language understanding is one of the coolest new areas of deep learning, and I'm extremely grateful to be a part of the team pushing the initiative at Brown. Working with Carsten and Ugur has been really interesting – our weekly group meetings are always full of new ideas and debate, and I'm lucky even to be able to sit in on them, let alone contribute to them in a meaningful way." 
Currently, their system implements a novel sequence-to-sequence deep model to translate natural language utterances into SQL, with performance comparable to other state-of-the-art NLIDBs. The next steps will be to further extend its capabilities. Possible avenues include adding more query templates for more functionality, using off-the-shelf dependency parsers, automatically recognizing nested queries and translating them independently, and expanding automatic paraphrasing using Paraphrase Database (PPDB). 
"I'm incredibly happy to have the opportunity to continue working on this project," says Nathaniel, "I'm very excited by challenges that use the capabilities of artificial intelligence to guide the process of human research: building a system that automates the process of receiving insights from databases is a perfect example of such a project. It's also given me the chance to explore the behavior of deep learning models in a hands-on way. A lot of the first obstacles in the process of getting the system up and running have already been passed in the last year – now I'm really excited to start tackling more complicated tasks. It's great that we already have a system performing to the level that it does, but knowing that there are ways to make it even more capable is really exciting."
That sort of excitement is exactly what Peter Norvig is looking for. He sees this award as a "multiplier" that will amplify the value of his gift and extend it through time. "In the past," he says, "we had to build all our own tools, and we didn't have time to combine computer science with other fields. Now, there are so many opportunities to do so. I think it's a wise choice: you invest in things that you think will do good, and educating a student allows them to help add to the things that you're already trying to accomplish." 
Each year, Brown University's Dean of the Faculty recognizes Brown faculty members with five excellence awards. Three are reserved for colleagues in other disciplines, but one of the remaining two awards is open to all assistant professors and lecturers, and the other is available to faculty in all of the physical sciences. This year, the Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) won both of them.
Michael Littman won the Philip J. Bray Award for Excellence in Teaching in the Physical Sciences, which recognizes Brown faculty members for sustained and continued excellence in teaching. He's the fifth Brown CS faculty member to win the Award, and he joins recent winners Barbara Meier and Philip Klein. Paul Valiant won the Dean's Award for Excellence in Teaching for the physical or life sciences, which recognizes faculty who hold the rank of assistant professor or lecturer. 
The full list is available here.
"We're moving," says Professor Theophilus "Theo" A. Benson of Brown University's Department of Computer Science, "into a new generation of software-defined infrastructure that incorporates virtualized network functions, 5th-generation cellular networks and advanced wireless communication technologies, and edge computing. Software-defined networking, or SDN, is a key enabling technology facilitating that transition. It's going to play a crucial role, but SDNs are prone to software design and implementation errors that can cause network failures and other catastrophic consequences. The networking research community needs key techniques and tools to maintain highly available and resilient networks."
Earlier this month, Theo won a National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER Award that will support creating those tools. CAREER Awards are given in support of outstanding junior faculty teacher-scholars who excel at research, education, and integration of the two within the context of an organizational mission, and Theo joins multiple previous Brown CS winners of the award, including (most recently) Stefanie Tellex, Jeff Huang, and Rodrigo Fonseca. 
Theo's research will address the needs of SDN by introducing a novel paradigm that advocates overcoming software "bugs" by transforming the bug-triggering inputs into "safe" inputs. To support this paradigm, the project will develop designs, abstractions and algorithms to identify, isolate, and transform the triggering inputs into safe inputs in a systematic and principled manner.
The project will examine several research thrusts to enable practical bug-tolerant networks, including:
After successfully defending his doctoral thesis last month, PhD candidate Justin Pombrio of Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) has a new honor to look back on as he plans his next move. Out of approximately 400 Brown graduate students with instruction-related appointments, he was one of only four to receive a Presidential Award for Excellence in Teaching.
The award, which was given at a ceremony in Pembroke Hall on April 30, recognizes outstanding pedagogical achievement. Its criteria include teaching that influences, motivates, and inspires students to learn and fosters independent learning; development of curriculum and resources that promote student learning; and development of students as individual learners.
Since 2013, Justin has been the sole graduate teaching assistant for Professor Shriram Krishnamurthi's upper-level course on programming languages, CSCI 1730, which has had enrollments of up to nearly 80 students. Justin developed assignments for the class that varied from year to year, conducted some grading, and held frequent office hours. "I love them," he says. "Teaching a whole class is difficult because everyone's on a different page, but in hours, I can figure out what a student is thinking, and explain things from their perspective."
In addition to his official duties, Justin devoted a considerable amount of his own time to what may be his most noteworthy contribution to the class. The Mystery Language approach to teaching, which he developed with Shriram, was described in a paper published at the Summit on Advances in Programming Languages, has already been used at other universities and has shown the potential to dramatically change the teaching of the subject.
Each mystery language is one language (syntax) with multiple semantics that explore the design space for a feature. All in all, Justin implemented 11 languages, with a total of 35 semantics. As the course moves forward, each language builds incrementally on the previous one, and each assignment introduces new syntactic features, requiring students to explore how new ones interact with old ones. Given a set of variants of a mystery language, a student’s task is to apply adversarial thinking to figure out how the variants differ, and then explain and categorize the differences.
"They've been a lot of fun to develop," Justin says, "and students seem to enjoy them too. They help teach you how to explore a programming language, which isn't something that's otherwise taught."
Professor Stefanie Tellex of Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) has just received an Early Career Research Achievement Award from Brown's Office of the Vice President for Research. Inaugurated last year, the Awards are given in three areas (Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences; Physical Sciences; and Life Sciences and Public Health) to a member of the faculty at the Assistant Professor level, or who was promoted to Associate Professor in the previous academic year, in recognition of an exemplary portfolio of research achievement during their first years at Brown. Stefanie joins Brown CS Adjunct Professor Tim Kraska, who won last year's Award in the Physical Sciences category. The Award is accompanied by a research stipend of $5,000.
Stefanie was cited for her artificial intelligence research into new approaches for human-robot communication. Her research group, the Humans to Robots Lab, aims to empower every person with a collaborative robot partner. She has won many top-tier awards and fellowships, including an NSF CAREER Award, Sloan Fellowship, and a DARPA Young Faculty Award. She has published more than 18 technical papers, with many in the top-tier venues of her research area. One of them ("Asking for Help Using Inverse Semantics") received a Best Paper Award. She has also secured significant grant funding from federal and industry sources, and her research has been covered by sources that include NPR, the New Yorker, Wired, and IEEE Spectrum. Stefanie also leads efforts to build community in her field, founding the Northeast Robotics Colloquium that annually brings together roboticists of all varieties from across the northeastern United States.

École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) has recently made "computational thinking" part of its curriculum for all students, and last month, they held the Teaching Computational Thinking Workshop to begin addressing questions about how the subject can and should be integrated into scientific and engineering programs.
As one of two keynote speakers (the other was Mark Guzdial of Georgia Institute of Technology), they invited Professor Shriram Krishnamurthi of Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS), who lectured on the idea of curriculum design as an engineering problem, and an extremely difficult one. "It requires substantial work," he writes, "on both technical and human-factors fronts; the audience is often unsophisticated and vulnerable; and if you screw up, you can do real damage to not only individuals but also the field and society."
The talk at EPFL (video available here) was the first of Shriram's two recent lectures in Europe. He also spoke at the Programming 2018 conference in Nice.
"People learn at different speeds and use different methods to reinforce what they are learning," writes Vinton G. Cerf in the latest issue of Communications of the ACM. Looking for pedagogy that breaks with tradition, the Internet pioneer finds inspiration in Bootstrap, a K-12 CS curriculum used worldwide that's directed by Kathi Fisler, Shriram Krishnamurthi, and Emmanuel Schanzer of Brown CS. "What makes Bootstrap...so memorable for me," he writes, "is that the team has focused heavily on accessibility."
Intrigued by a coding demonstration that includes an audible depiction of the programmer's current status in the program, Cerf is reminded that a need for accessibility parallels the necessity of an educational approach that adapts to the learner: "What seems more important about the work at Bootstrap...is the potential to provide students closer to STEM learning with tools that move at the same pace at which the students can move."
"Designed for this kind of adaptability and flexibility," Cerf writes, Bootstrap is an example of self-paced learning with varying reinforcement methods. And the need for this new approach, he thinks, is real: "This sort of adaptable and convenient online learning is sure to be a part of 21st-century careers."
This week, Professor Shriram Krishnamurthi of Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) continues a busy season of domestic and international lectures by delivering a keynote address ("The Recurring Rainfall Problem") at the International Conference on the Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming (Programming 2018) conference in Nice, France. Now in its second year, Programming is focused on various programming topics, including the experience of programming. Shriram will be speaking on Wednesday, April 11, at 9 AM, and his talk includes the unusual feature of requiring the audience to write programs in real time.
The Rainfall problem, developed by Elliot Soloway, is a classic benchmark in computing education research, designed to study plan composition: how students decompose problems into tasks, solve them, and compose the solutions. "Over multiple decades, locations, and languages," Shriram explains, "students have done poorly at it. However, recent multi-institution studies of students using functional programming and How to Design Programs find very different outcomes. What do these results tell us?" His talk, based on his work with Brown CS Professor (Research) Kathi Fisler, will explore relationships between programming languages, program design, curricula, and how students perceive code structure.
Most recently, Shriram spoke at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (video available here).
For decades, we've heard from our undergrads that the chance to perform cutting-edge research is one of the primary reasons why they chose Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS). Far from the clerical duties or errand-running that some have encountered elsewhere, we offer the chance to work with world-class faculty in a truly collaborative environment on problems of real worth. Just in the past six months, one of our undergrad researchers was chosen as one of 25 students from a pool of 6,432 for an Undergraduate Award and two others won CRA Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Honorable Mentions.
During the summer, Brown's Undergraduate Teaching and Research Awards (UTRAs) provide students with a $3,750 stipend for their work with faculty. This year, Brown CS has received a record number of them, and they reflect both the growth of computer science at Brown and the breadth and depth of our research:
We also have a number of Interdisciplinary Team (I-Team) UTRAs as part of a program designed to increase research opportunities for a diverse range of first and second year students, encourage student intellectual growth through peer mentorship and group learning, and encourage interdisciplinary scholarship between and among Brown faculty: 
We're looking forward to a great summer, and we can't wait to share the stories of their results in the days ahead. 
Less than a year after Professor Theophilus (Theo) A. Benson's arrival at Brown University’s Computer Science Department (Brown CS), and less than two after Professor George Konidaris joined the Brown CS faculty, they've each received a Richard B. Salomon Faculty Research Award. A full list of awardees is available here. The award, given annually by Brown’s Office of the Vice-President for Research, was established to support excellence in scholarly work by providing funding for selected faculty research projects of exceptional merit with preference given to junior faculty who are in the process of building their research portfolio. They join multiple previous Brown CS winners, including Jeff Huang, Stefanie Tellex, Rodrigo Fonseca, Sherief Reda, and Ugur Cetintemel.
"Mobile devices," says Theo when asked to explain his research, "have become the primary mode of Internet access in both developed and developing countries. Yet, in developing regions, driven by their low cost, mobile devices are often equipped with small memory sizes and slow CPUs. For example, according to a recent study of mobile devices in Pakistan, 90% of devices were equipped with at most 1024MB of RAM, and 89% had 1GHz or slower processors. Despite the prevalence of such low-end devices in these markets, there are few systematic studies of the differences between web performance on low-end and high-end smartphones. Additionally, we lack principled techniques to analyze and improve performance on these low-end phones."
The goal of his proposal is to fill that vital gap:
George explains his research as follows: "Solar panel tracking improves the solar panel energy production by pointing them towards the sun throughout the day. Existing tracking algorithms compute the location of the sun in the sky via astronomical calculations, and move solar panels to match that angle. However, these calculations do not account for reflective and diffuse radiance or weather conditions that impact the efficiency of tracking algorithms. We reframe the problem of collecting energy from the sun as a contextual bandit problem, where the solar panel is controlled by a learning program attempting to maximize the 'reward' (i.e. energy) it collects. A small working group of graduate and undergraduate students at Brown has performed extensive simulated experiments in a variety of scenarios, indicating that in many locations on the Earth contextual bandit approaches outperform existing baselines. The group has also constructed a small, low-cost prototype of a single-axis solar tracking system, leading to preliminary results and publications accepted to RLDM, EnviroInfo, and IAAI conferences."
They propose three goals:
George and Theo will receive their awards at Brown's annual Celebration of Research on Thursday, April 19th, at the Faculty Club.
Research by Professor Theophilus "Theo" A. Benson of Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) and his collaborators has just won one of the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF)'s six Applied Networking Research Prizes for 2018. It's also one of only two papers that will be presented at the IRTF Open Meeting during the IETF-1 conference in London next month. Out of 55 eligible nominations, the selection committee chose Theo's work on the grounds of scientific excellence and substance, timeliness, relevance, and potential impact on the Internet.
The research ("Performance Characterization of a Commercial Video Streaming Service"), which Theo conducted while at Duke University in 2016 with lead author Mojgan Ghasemi (Princeton University) and co-authors Partha Kanuparthy (Yahoo Research), Ahmed Mansy (Yahoo), and Jennifer Rexford (Princeton University), offers detailed analysis of a commercial video streaming service and the problems that impact its performance.
"Our work," Theo explains, "extends the community's understanding of well-accepted approaches to diagnosing video performance. In particular, while existing research focuses on diagnosing problems with information available at either the client, the server, or the ISPs packet, this extensive study demonstrated that a strong and prevalent class of performance problems can only be discovered if data from both clients and servers are collected and systematically analyzed. Building on these observations, we worked with the developers of Apache Traffic Server, a prominent web server that's being actively used by many Fortune 500 companies, including Yahoo, Comcast, Akamai, and LinkedIn, to introduce fixes and patches."
In the ongoing effort to bring diversity and inclusion to the field of computer science, it was one step backward and then at least two in a profoundly positive direction. When the world's largest gathering of security experts, RSA Conference, announced this year's speaker list last week, many attendees were stunned and disappointed to find that only one woman was included. That disappointment was quickly channeled into action, and within a few days, a group of computer scientists had put together OUR Security Advocates (OURSA), a competing conference with a diverse set of speakers, including Professor Seny Kamara of Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS).
OURSA will be held on April 17, 2018, in San Francisco, and include four topic sessions (Advocating for High-Risk Groups, Applied Security Engineering, Practical Privacy Protection, and Security Policy and Ethics for Emerging Tech), each with short talks from multiple experts followed by a moderated discussion.
"The speaker list from RSA caused a lot of frustration," says Seny, "because there are a lot of really accomplished women in security that they could have asked. It’s disappointing but I'm really impressed by the OURSA organizers, who put together a stellar lineup of people almost overnight. I'm very happy to be a part of it." 
OURSA has already received a great deal of positive media coverage, including CNET, USA Today, Gizmodo, and the BBC. 
The Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers (KPCB) Engineering Fellows Program is one of technology’s most prestigious fellowships, with only 51 students chosen in 2018 from a pool of almost 3,000. This year, undergraduate students Lauren Ho and Nina Polshakova were selected from Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS), and they join winners from previous years that include Michael Chang, Michael Markell, Noah Picard, and Hannah Tipperman.
Despite the program's title, it's open to outstanding students who are studying computer science, engineering, mathematics, physics, or other fields related to software development: Lauren and Nina are both computer science concentrators. They'll join other students from across the country in Silicon Valley for a work experience (participating companies span the industry and the alphabet from Airbnb to Zumper) that will be supplemented with events and programming led by CEOs and executives from KPCB portfolio companies and KPCB Partners.
Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) is happy to announce that pending the anticipated approval of the Corporation of Brown, Amy Greenwald will be promoted to the rank of Full Professor and Seny Kamara will be promoted to Associate Professor with tenure, effective July 1, 2018.
Amy joined Brown CS on January 1, 2000. Her research has two goals: first, the effort to design and implement AI agents that interact effectively in multiagent environments where the other agents might be humans and might sometimes exhibit surprising behavior; second, the effort to understand, explain, and accurately predict the long-term and short-term dynamics of such interactions. Recently, she gave a keynote address at Microsoft's Faculty Summit; she also leads the Brown CS chapter of Google's igniteCS initiative, in which university student volunteers teach basic computer science literacy to K-12 students in local, underserved public schools.
Seny joined Brown CS in 2016 after working for Microsoft Research. His work is in applied cryptography and is driven by real-world problems from privacy, security and surveillance. His primary focus is on the design and analysis of encrypted algorithms, which are efficient algorithms that operate on encrypted data. He maintains interests in various aspects of theory and systems, including applied and theoretical cryptography, data structures and algorithms, cloud computing, data management, economics, technology policy and networking. Recently, he co-authored an NAS report on encryption and co-created Pixek, an app that offers searchable encryption for digital photos.
"Though my head is often in security, networking, formal methods, and HCI," says Professor Shriram Krishnamurthi of Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS), "my heart is in programming languages." He now gets to share his latest thoughts on the subject with a wide audience: he and six co-authors have made the cover of Communications of the ACM with an article ("A Programmable Programming Language") that evaluates the current state of the 20-year-old Racket project and looks ahead to what's next.
In the article, Shriram and his co-authors focus on the need of programmers to create and use embedded program-specific languages as part of software development. The Racket project, which began in 1995, started as an experiment to create a language for experimenting with pedagogic programming languages, but developed into a multi-lingual system with one guiding principle: Empower programmers to create new programming languages easily and to add them with a friction-free process to a code base.
Advances such as Racket's modular syntax system have been made, the authors explain, but areas such as security and dynamic checking have only been partially developed. In the end, they note, "Programming language research has stopped short of the ultimate goal, namely, to provide software developers with tools to formulate solutions in the languages of problem domains." More challenges remain to be solved, and so the Racket project goes on.

Just over a year ago, Professor Seny Kamara of Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS), along with 13 other experts from academia and industry, was appointed to a new committee created by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The committee ("Law Enforcement and Intelligence Access to Plaintext Information in an Era of Widespread Strong Encryption: Options and Tradeoffs") is part of the organization's Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences, and it's been working to examine the tradeoffs associated with mechanisms to provide authorized government agencies with access to the plaintext version of encrypted information.
Last week, the committee released their first report ("Decrypting the Encryption Debate: A Framework for Decision Makers"), with the goal of better informing the policy debate and future decision making on encryption. The report covers the entire spectrum of how encryption is used, including:
In an area where there's little consensus among government officials, privacy advocates, and industry and academic experts, it's an attempt to create the language and shape the outlines of a dialogue that will inform leading policymakers worldwide. "The committee hopes," they write, "that the common vocabulary and broad context provided by this report, as well as the analytical framework, will make future conversations easier, more productive, and more likely." 
"Originally, this class was intended to be a quiet graduate seminar with about ten people," says Professor Maurice Herlihy of Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS). He's talking about a class of his own design (CSCI 2952-A Blockchains and Cryptocurrencies) that's one of a very few courses dealing with the subject nationwide, particularly from a scientific perspective. It had to be capped at 60 students this semester. "I was impressed," he says, "by how eager students were to look past the sensationalism and approach this from the scientist's point of view, finding the substance underneath the hype."
A blockchain is a cryptographically-secured series of records usually managed by a peer-to-peer network that allows transactions between parties to be verified and permanently recorded. At present, Bitcoin is easily the most well-known. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, which is a type of digital currency that uses cryptography to secure transactions. Cryptocurrencies and the other forms that blockchains take are a natural fit for Maurice's expertise in distributed systems.
"In a certain sense, blockchains are the ultimate distributed systems," he explains. "They're a very productive approach, and I think it's fair to say that blockchain creators are helping reinvent distributed computing. But they don't always get it right."
"Because blockchains are a new area," Maurice says, "we're seeing many promises that can't be kept. People are being led, naively or sometimes fraudulently, to invest money or effort in projects that can't possibly work." What will work, he thinks, is a revolution of how trust operates in distributed systems, producing results not in the cryptocurrency realm but in areas such as financial trading transparency, anti-corruption efforts, or even verifying the origins of seafood.   
"I believe that's the future of blockchains, and my students have really enjoyed getting a new perspective and depth on them. Instead of being a get-rich-quick scheme, I think they'll be turned to purposes that are increasingly challenging, important, and technically sophisticated, and Brown's interdisciplinary strengths are a perfect fit to organize something lasting on the subject."

Professor Elizabeth Mynatt of Georgia Institute of Technology visited the CIT last week to address Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) and deliver the thirty-fifth lecture in the Distinguished Lecture Series. Using a retrospective of her research projects as a foundation, the talk ("Rethinking Ubiquitous Computing to Transform Healthcare") demonstrated how an integration of computing research, human-centered design, and health management theory can create promising approaches for promoting wellness, supporting behavior change, and delivering improved health outcomes.
"The unique capabilities of pervasive computing technologies have the potential to transform healthcare," she explained, "by shifting care from institutional to home settings, by helping individuals engage in their own care, by facilitating problem solving and decision making, and by creating a network of communication and collaboration channels that extends healthcare delivery to everyday settings."
From the first research project Mynatt mentioned (the Digital Family Portrait, which she cited as an example of the difficulty of visually conveying how a person is doing), questions were frequent and enthusiastic. When she spoke of her work inadvertently predicting the attention economy, the audience was ready with a light-hearted response: "So you're responsible, then!"
In each of her examples, Professor Mynatt returned to the idea that our health is personal, social, and negotiated, and that technological interventions often have unintended consequences. "We have to remember," she said, "that the social implications of our work are very hard to predict." But she spoke enthusiastically about the joy of helping create "new cycles of mastery" for diabetics, or the moment when the technological aspect of a solution became invisible, allowing trusted relationships to continue. Many of her research's best discoveries, she explained, came from starting not from a medical school mentality but a family and home mentality. 
Professor Jeff Huang, who was in attendance, appreciates that approach. "It was exciting," he said, "to hear from Professor Mynatt, who is thinking about accessible health data from a patient-centered perspective, rather than a traditional provider-centric solution. I heard from several students who were inspired by her ability to tell a compelling story around her research projects, sprinkled with witty sci-fi references."

The Computing Research Association (CRA) is a coalition of more than 200 organizations with the mission of enhancing innovation by joining with industry, government and academia to strengthen research and advanced education in computing. Every year, they recognize North American students who show phenomenal research potential with their Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Award, and last year, Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) made one of the strongest showings in the Honorable Mentions category. Out of forty-seven students who received Honorable Mentions, three of them are Brown CS students: Siddharth Karamcheti, Sorawee Porncharoenwase, and Eric Rosen.
Asked about his work, Siddharth says, "My primary areas of research are natural language processing and machine learning – I specifically focus on problems dealing with how we use language to interact with and understand the world around us. I have two big projects that I’ve worked on the last couple of years, under the supervision of Professor Charniak and Professor Tellex. The first is in human-robot interaction: how do we get robots to follow natural language instructions? The second big project is focused on question-answering: how do we develop models that can read and understand short stories, perform reasoning, and answer complex questions? Outside of natural language, I also work on problems on combining machine learning with automated program testing, or 'fuzzing'. The idea here is to use methods from reinforcement learning in conjunction with existing tools for program analysis and testing to find inputs that crash or unearth bugs in the programs under test, in a manner that is faster and more efficient than existing fuzzers." 
"My work (with Tim Nelson and Shriram Krishnamurthi)," says Sorawee, "improves model finders, which are programs producing a set of models that satisfy input constraints. Commonly used in software engineering to explore and verify systems' behavior, model finders however could inundate users with models that don't offer more useful information. We explored using syntax to evaluate how 'interesting' a model is, and investigated how to find a set of these interesting models. The result is a model finder that produces a more concise and useful set of models."
Eric wanted to share some links to four different blog posts about his research. The first three, he explains, are paper publications, and the fourth is an introductory research project from his first year at Brown:

Researchers from Brown University and MIT have developed a method for helping robots plan for multi-step tasks by constructing abstract representations of the world around them. Their study, published in the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, is a step toward building robots that can think and act more like people.
Planning is a monumentally difficult thing for robots, largely because of how they perceive and interact with the world. A robot’s perception of the world consists of nothing more than the vast array of pixels collected by its cameras, and its ability to act is limited to setting the positions of the individual motors that control its joints and grippers. It lacks an innate understanding of how those pixels relate to what we might consider meaningful concepts in the world.
“That low-level interface with the world makes it really hard to do decide what to do,” said George Konidaris, an assistant professor of computer science at Brown and the lead author of the new study. “Imagine how hard it would be to plan something as simple as a trip to the grocery store if you had to think about each and every muscle you’d flex to get there, and imagine in advance and in detail the terabytes of visual data that would pass through your retinas along the way. You’d immediately get bogged down in the detail. People, of course, don’t plan that way. We’re able to introduce abstract concepts that throw away that huge mass of irrelevant detail and focus only on what is important.”
Even state-of-the-art robots aren’t capable of that kind of abstraction. When we see demonstrations of robots planning for and performing multistep tasks, “it’s almost always the case that a programmer has explicitly told the robot how to think about the world in order for it to make a plan,” Konidaris said. “But if we want robots that can act more autonomously, they’re going to need the ability to learn abstractions on their own.”
In computer science terms, these kinds of abstractions fall into two categories: “procedural abstractions” and “perceptual abstractions.” Procedural abstractions are programs made out of low-level movements composed into higher-level skills. An example would be bundling all the little movements needed to open a door — all the motor movements involved in reaching for the knob, turning it and pulling the door open — into a single “open the door” skill. Once such a skill is built, you don’t need to worry about how it works. All you need to know is when to run it. Roboticists — including Konidaris himself — have been studying how to make robots learn procedural abstractions for years, he says.
But according to Konidaris, there’s been less progress in perceptual abstraction, which has to do with helping a robot make sense of its pixelated surroundings. That’s the focus of this new research.  
“Our work shows that once a robot has high-level motor skills, it can automatically construct a compatible high-level symbolic representation of the world — one that is provably suitable for planning using those skills,” Konidaris said.
Learning abstract states of the world
For the study, the researchers introduced a robot named Anathema Device (or Ana, for short) to a room containing a cupboard, a cooler, a switch that controls a light inside the cupboard, and a bottle that could be left in either the cooler or the cupboard. They gave Ana a set of high-level motor skills for manipulating the objects in the room—opening and closing both the cooler and the cupboard, flipping the switch and picking up a bottle. Then they turned Ana loose to try out her motor skills in the room, recording the sensory data from her cameras and actuators before and after each skill execution. Those data were fed into the machine-learning algorithm developed by the team.
The researchers showed that Ana was able to learn a very abstract description of the environment that contained only what was necessary for her to be able perform a particular skill. For example, she learned that in order to open the cooler, she needed to be standing in front of it and not holding anything (because she needed both hands to open the lid). She also learned the proper configuration of pixels in her visual field associated with the cooler lid being closed, which is the only configuration in which it’s possible to open it.
She learned similar abstractions associated with her other skills. She learned, for example, that the light inside cupboard was so bright that it whited out her sensors. So in order to manipulate the bottle inside the cupboard, the light had to be off. She also learned that in order to turn the light off, the cupboard door needed to be closed, because the open door blocked her access to the switch. The resulting abstract representation distilled all that knowledge down from high-definition images to a text file, just 126 lines long.
“These were all the important abstract concepts about her surroundings,” Konidaris said. “Doors need to be closed before they can be opened. You can’t get the bottle out of the cupboard unless it’s open, and so on. And she was able to learn them just by executing her skills and seeing what happens.”
Planning in the abstract
Once Ana was armed with her learned abstract representation, the researchers asked her to do something that required some planning: take the bottle from the cooler and put it in the cupboard.
As they hoped she would, Ana navigated to the cooler and opened it to reveal the bottle. But she didn’t pick it up. Instead, she planned ahead. She realized that if she had the bottle in her gripper, then she wouldn’t be able to open the cupboard, because doing so requires both hands. So after she opened the cooler, she navigated to the cupboard. There she saw that the light switch in the “on” position, and she realized that opening the cupboard would block the switch, so she turned the switch off before opening the cupboard, returning to the cooler and retrieving the bottle, and finally placing it in the cupboard. In short, she planned ahead, identifying problems and fixing them before they could occur.
“We didn’t provide Ana with any of the abstract representations she needed to plan for the task,” Konidaris said. “She learned those abstractions on her own, and once she had them, planning was easy. She found that plan in only about four milliseconds.”
Konidaris says the research provides an important theoretical building block for applying artificial intelligence to robotics. “We believe that allowing our robots to plan and learn in the abstract rather than the concrete will be fundamental to building truly intelligent robots,” he said. “Many problems are often quite simple, if you think about them in the right way.”
Konidaris’ coauthors on the paper were Leslie Pack Kaelbling and Tomas Lozano-Perez from MIT. The research was supported by an award from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and by MIT’s Intelligence Initiative.

Security breach by security breach, data leak by data leak, digital privacy is becoming a household phrase, but for many people, putting a four-digit passcode on their smart phone is the extent of their security measures. Just this week, researchers from Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) have helped users of all kinds significantly improve their privacy in the digital world by targeting one of its most popular components: cloud photo storage. Professor Seny Kamara, Postdoctoral Researcher Tarik Moataz, and Brown CS alum Martin Zhu have just released Pixek, a new app that uses structured encryption to provide a simple solution for keeping our photos private while in the cloud. 
"My sense is that photos are this special case," Seny says, "where people have to use the cloud because the sentimental value is too high to risk losing them and the storage costs are too large. And they give up privacy because of it."
Pixek protects users by offering encryption for the entire life cycle of a photo: when you take a photo on your smart device, the app immediately encrypts it, generating a key that only exists on your device, and then the photo is stored in encrypted form on Pixek's servers. Because the key stays only on your hardware, it remains encrypted and inaccessible to anyone else.   
So now you have a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand encrypted photos. But what's the use of encryption if you can't securely search them without giving up privacy once again? Pixek solves this problem by using a technique known as structured encryption, which allows search functions to be performed without the system understanding the work that's being done. 
Here's how it happens: Pixek automatically uses machine learning analysis to recognize objects and elements in your photos, then generates a series of tags that are encrypted alongside the photos. When you search for "cat" or any other tag, Pixek uses your unique key to encrypt the search and generates a unique token to unlock relevant photos. Without the token, it's impossible to replicate the same search, and because the token isn't stored on servers, you retain control.   
"People today know what end-to-end encryption is," Seny says. "They're starting to have an expectation that their apps are end-to-end encrypted. At some point people will expect that their photos will be end-to-end encrypted, too."
Pixek is only being distributed in its alpha version on Android at the moment, but a public beta will appear in the months ahead and an iOS version will follow. It's already received considerable attention worldwide, from an article in WIRED to a feature on CBC Radio and a BoingBoing post. You can also watch a video of Seny talking about building and deploying encrypted search systems at the Real World Crypto conference.

This story was originally published in the December 2017 issue of Conduit, the annual Brown CS magazine.
It’s half past noon in CIT 368 on May 18, 2017. After fourteen years of Senior Lecturer Barbara Meier’s computer animation classes at Brown, after months of focused effort, we have something very new, a first: Toymaker, a seven-minute animated short.
Every seat is full, and much of the floor. The lights are dimmed. In darkness, there’s room for multiplicity. The student who started the whole thing is here with her team of thirteen. There’s the teacher and mentor who didn’t just advise but worked the long hours alongside them; here’s the composer who wrote the score and helped perform it. Classmates from RISD as well as Brown are gathered, friends and friends of friends, and the colleagues and experts who are maybe the only ones to fully understand the scope of what’s been accomplished.
But why subdivide the ineffable? The flickering screen makes us all spectators again. We’re drawn to the high spire, the telescope, to humankind’s mastery of art or science on the grandest scale, but also to the personal and small: the studio in all its clutter, the Wozniakian garage, or here, the string of fleeting moments that tell a much bigger story.
We’re ready to wonder again. Barb’s about to hit the ► button.
Take a moment to see it for yourself: https://vimeo.com/242488116
Not Knowing What The Recipe Would Make: Barbara Meier
Before story, history: Barb traces her interest in animation to when she was twelve or thirteen. Her parents disapprove of most daytime television, so she watches when they aren’t home, and is awed by the hand-drawn work that she sees in an animated film festival. At first, a career as an animator seems as unlikely as becoming an Olympic skater, but in the years that follow, Barb finds herself returning to the idea that animation is just drawing on paper. “It didn’t have to be this mysterious process,” she says. “I felt like it was an actual possibility.”
But there’s plenty of mystery to come along a zigzagging career path. Studying computer science as a Brown undergrad, Barb sees the potential for using computer graphics (CG) in animation and is drawn to auteur animation’s ability to realize the vision of a single artist. She credits Andy van Dam for encouraging her to apply to the Brown CS Master’s program, and postgraduate work follows at RISD, the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston (their curriculum replicates the working life of an artist, an idea that Barb returns to later in her own teaching), and the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena.
Industry work catches Barb’s attention first, and she spends almost a decade in California, creating animated effects and digital matte paintings. It isn’t easy: long hours, constant pressure to work faster and lower costs, extremely narrow margins. “I knew it wasn’t going to sustain me forever,” she says. “I wanted kids, a life. It was a really great ride, but I thought I could take what I’d learned everywhere and bring my industry experience to students, even if I didn’t know what the recipe would make.” A book about making a career change had recommended teaching, and with more than a little hesitation (Barb remembers saying, “No, not that! That’s for people who are washed-up.”) she returns to Brown.
Barb agrees to take on CS195-9 (now CS 125) in mid-July of 2003. Beyond any doubt, it’s trial by fire. She remembers frantically picking software for the course in August, trying to prepare lectures with two small boys running around the house, finishing her notes an hour before the class begins. She says, “The one thing I think I did well was setting up a structure and creating assignments. Right away, I saw the students doing really good work, exceeding expectations on every task I gave them.” Graduates of the course often continued working with Barb independently, which sparked the need for a second course, CS 128 Intermediate Computer Animation. One trend continues year after year: students are coming to her with more interest in animation and better experience with it, so she continually moves content from the second course to the first.
CS 125 presents students with the new challenge of creating a short film at the end of the course. “But they’re really bare-bones,” Barb says, smiling. “It's an important project because it forces students to tackle all parts of the film, even those they've barely practiced. If they pause to polish one area, they'll never finish the rest. CS 128 addresses the desire to go back and do it right, to learn the artistic and technical skills at a deeper level. The price is that lavishing more time on every stage of production makes it impossible to finish a short film at the end. The ultimate dream is to flex the deeply-honed skills to finally make a high-quality short film.”
Occasionally, some students follow that dream.
Portraits From Life: Nellie Robinson
“One of the main things I got out of CS 125,” says Nellie Robinson, “was working as a team on our one-month short. I wanted to repeat the experience.” That was the start of Toymaker.
Since graduating in May (she has a dual degree from RISD), Nellie has been working at Ingenuity Studios in Los Angeles. As a kid, we find her working with crafts (turning tissue boxes into apartment buildings, building a tiny playground out of concert tickets) and drawing portraits from life: “I always enjoyed drawing, but I never thought about how it could be applied to other things.” She doesn’t take any CS courses in her first year at Brown and RISD, but learns Processing, a programming language built on Java for the art and design community. “I really liked looking at the output of code I’d written, the visual aspect.” she says. “Maybe I was drawn to computer animation because it’s squarely between the technical and the artistic.”
That summer, Nellie interns at Pixar, and CS 125 follows. It’s motivation enough for a big project of her own, so she goes to Barb in November of 2015 with a pitch for a new class. The reaction?
“Ugh, not again!” Meier laughs, pantomiming despair by putting a hand to her forehead and slowly lowering her head to her desk. In the past, students have asked her for a third class, to work on bigger projects: it was offered once, in 2011. “I was wearing too many hats, producer and director, and it was frustrating in many ways. Unintentionally, we set ourselves up to fail. When Nellie came to me, I gave her a choice, and when she picked a class instead of a group independent study project, I set very high bars: lots of monitoring throughout the process, at least ten people on the team, and having one person as the sole producer.”
And so it begins. “At the start,” Nellie says, “it felt entirely reasonable.”
Spring And Summer: Pre-Production
Take a look at Toymaker again, focusing on nothing but the textures: the dull plastic handle on the cheap pair of scissors that we all own, clumped and gummy glue, the glint of a paperclip. But there’s more. Look closer. See how paint feathers at its edges into woodgrain, or how age and reuse turn a soda bottle’s perfect transparence into translucence, or –quick, you only have seconds to admire it– the hundreds of crisscrossing scores that a utility knife makes in the slightly nubbly rubber of a tabletop-protecting mat.
In the spring of 2016, Robinson has her story, so she brings it to Megan Jerbic of RISD, who begins turning it into a script. Nellie starts working with other RISD friends (Mariel Rodriguez and Julie Kwon on character design, Michelle Zhuang and Yoo Jin Shin on set design), and soon it’s time for choosing color palettes and designing objects that will make up the Toymaker world. “The main feed for the visuals,” she says, “was the DIY mentality. I’m really interested in repurposing objects, turning trash into fantasy worlds.” As a possible aesthetic influence, Nellie cites the stop-motion work of Laika Entertainment: “Objects have flaws. There aren’t a lot of perfect perpendiculars, it’s kind of wonky – you can tell the materials of everything.”
Her original idea for the cast of characters is an old man and his daughter: “That was the first thing that came to mind, but the artists pointed out, and I agreed, that it was a trope that’s been done a lot, the old craftsman neglecting his kids. "Turning the toymaker into a working single mother is more nuanced and relevant. We're instantly aware of her work/life balance, and this places more importance on the difference between providing for her daughter and connecting with her daughter.”
It’s a notion that makes it easy to understand how Nellie’s mentor might have been drawn to the project. “I want to change how people look at the seemingly small issues of everyday life,” Barb writes in a recent Artist Statement, “but those that affect us and our relationships in some of the more profound ways.”
Summer: Much More Than A Community
Summer arrives, and Nellie has managed to gather enough people to meet Barb’s requirement.
“If I’d stopped to think about it,” says Kenji Endo (now Head TA for CS 125, he’s graduating in the spring of 2018), “maybe I wouldn’t have thought Toymaker was feasible. But it was so cool! Nellie has a great artistic eye and technical skill. And the people drew me in, the sense of community.”
It’s time to meet the team. Thanks to prior work with Barb, the students know the production pipeline of animation inside and out: Meier immediately assigns each phase of the project to one or two leaders and possibly a “worker bee” or two under their direction. Each leader has to define their job and their team’s goals. The poster for Toymaker lists everyone in alphabetical order: Luci Cooke, Dash Elhauge, Kenji Endo, Felege Gebru, Emma Herold, Simon Jones, Barbara Meier, Vivian Morgowicz, Ray Muñoz, Ben Nacar, Emily Reif, Nellie Robinson, Yoo Jin Shin.
Megan Jerbic, Julie Kwon, Mariel Rodriguez, and Michelle Zhuang also contributed to the script, storyboards, character design, prop design, and set design; Melanie Ambler and Irene Tang accompanied Ben Nacar on the Toymaker score.
“I think Nellie said it in a Facebook post,” says Barb. “The whole reason wasn’t to make this film but to make it with these people. The students were already a community from taking classes together, but they were much more than that at the end. The hard work came out of not wanting to let each other down.”
At the beginning, did it ever feel too ambitious, even impossible? Nellie thinks for a moment: “I’m not sure, but if it did, that feeling definitely increased as time went on. When something is pushed back a few days, it pushes back everything else. The whole project felt slightly more unreasonable each week.”
Fall: Modeling, Shading, Character Modeling, Rigging, Layout, Blocking
And the weeks are already going by. For a visual, picture the MS Lab, which serves as home base. No matter which hour of the day or night it may be, Nellie and the others have gotten used to seeing at least one member of the Toymaker team at work whenever they walk in.
The leaders have set up the assignments for their worker bees, but sometimes all hands are needed. Modeling is one of the biggest pieces of the puzzle, and it involves creating the geometry of everything in the set based on sketches, then applying textures, color, surface properties. Set dressers are putting the props into place, just like they’re moving into a new apartment: walls, doors, shelves, down to the last detail. The shading of an object depends on where it sits in the set and how it’s used. The spine of a book on a shelf that never gets read doesn’t take much time, but the shaders kick into high gear on certain objects that drive the story, that we see again and again.
Kenji says that he likes tackling technical challenges from an artistic angle. “We’re making everything in this world from scratch,” he says. “We’re responsible for time of day, the mood. The architecture of the world helps tell the story.”
The layout process turns the storyboard into shots: it could be a one-to-one ratio, or a shot might be made up of as many as six storyboard panels. Blocking, the positioning of characters, begins with all of them in T-pose, with their arms straight out. There’s not an actual camera to be found, of course, but the team is agonizing over close-ups and long shots like any Hollywood director.
Eventually, the storyboard is replaced with quickly-rendered blocking shots. “It’s really tough,” Barb says, “because what you have is crude and what you want is very high-level. It’s like editing a paper to adjust the arguments before the grammar is completely there.” Character modeling is another big technical challenge: it’s a lot more complicated to make a person than a coffee cup. They might be too tall, too old, too cute, and soon they’ll have to move, so their underlying geometry has to have integrity. The rigging process builds an armature inside the characters, giving the animators controls to grab onto.  
At various points in time, Nellie explains, many of the students are working on the project almost every day. On many nights and weekends, Barb works from her home in Barrington, her coffee intake slowly increasing; at other times, the students wrestle the file system and work remotely, separately. But every week starts the same way: a look at everyone’s work, two and a half hours of detailed critiques. “It was really fun to go in depth in our reviews every week, to iterate and improve over time,” says Kenji. “Everyone got to specialize in their favorite area, but we all learned more about each component of the project, even if we weren’t working on it.”
“I loved that part,” Nellie says. “I was surprised every week by what people were doing – you got to see a little bit of magic.”
The Music Drives Things: Ben Nacar
Brown CS alum Ben Nacar is one of the first people to join Nellie’s team: Barb emails him an invitation in May, 2016. (She knows him from his work on an advisee’s capstone project.) His contributions begin early, but we deliberately turn to him just now, in the middle of the action. Until we have a sense of the textures, the props, the production work that’s going on around him as he writes the score, it’s impossible to see how the music springs from the deepest core of the story.
Go back to Toymaker again and listen. A picture book open on a girl’s lap shows a fairground lit with the nearer stars of carnival lights, the far ones tiny and sunk in indigo sky. There’s only a piano playing in the background; the midway calliope is just your imagination. But did you catch that little flourish as Angela’s hand moves over the carousel? Later, just shy of one minute into the short, Ben has exactly seven seconds to capture all the subtleties of this mother looking back at this sleeping girl in this moment. Listen to what he does with it. 
“I was really drawn to the story,” he says. As a kid, Ben dabbles in filmmaking, telling stories with stuffed animals. “We moved the animals around with nylon threads that we hoped people wouldn’t be able to see, but they could anyway! I went back to those memories of just playing, imagining, reading Robert Louis Stevenson – trying to recapture that. The world of Toymaker is very vivid but fragile. Maria is doing work but her heart isn’t in it: even when they’re happily reading in bed, it’s a little sad. When the village comes to life, it’s a separate melody, more emotions.”
One of Ben’s early tasks is to create a mock soundtrack as a reference. He uses bits of Beethoven, the Firefly soundtrack, John Williams, but it’s “a bit of a chore” because it reminds him how far he’ll have to go for the results he wants. “I had to ask early on what the instrumentation would be,” he explains. “It’s more intimate than a regular Hollywood blockbuster – an orchestra would be overkill. I looked at eastern European music, which historically was often used in animation, but traditional classical is my idiom, so I went with piano, violin, and cello, letting myself be influenced by klezmer and other traditions rather than trying to duplicate a particular style.”  
Ben describes himself as a melody-centric composer, and as the team starts feeding him materials (only sketches at first), he begins drafting just a couple of lines: capturing character and mood, then extrapolating from there. Tara Fisler (daughter of Professors Kathi Fisler and Shriram Krishnamurthi) and team member Emily Reif star in a live action demo that gives him a sense of timing and flow, and within a week, he has a rough draft of the first half. The second follows a week later. Starting at the beginning of October, Ben’s there at every weekly meeting, and not as a silent partner: “I loved being involved in the process...I really felt like part of the whole.”
He has a practice session with his musicians in late autumn, and the final recording session at the end of January. “By then,” Ben says, “the timing was pinned down and the animators had to work from what I’d done. It’s the opposite of live-action films, but animators and composers work much more in parallel. At that point, Barb and the others and I agreed that we had to lock the timing so I could proceed. The script inspires the music, not the other way around, but the music drives things, not so much the plot as the emotional content of the film.”
With his score in the background, production work goes on. And as our conversation with Ben winds down, we ask him about being part of the Toymaker team. In retrospect, what was the entire experience of working on the short like? “Every time I go back to it,” he says, “It feels special. That’s a mark of success for me.”
Winter And Spring: Animation, Lighting, Shading, Sound
Technically, animation starts in the last week of November. The leads are assigning shots to animators, and each student’s work has to join with work from the student before them and the one after. If one of those two finishes first, and the merge doesn’t look good, the animator in the middle may be forced to redo their shot.
This is when we see real emotions come out of the characters: here are the corners of the mouth for Angela’s mad face, and here’s Maria thinking about something. What about those eyelids, are they too open? According to Barb, animation is different from any other part of the pipeline: people who struggled with modeling may turn out to be natural animators, and vice-versa.
Two-thirds done is Meier’s rough estimate for where things are at the end of the year. Only an approximate 20% of the work is creative at this point, and the rest is babysitting the rendering, cleaning up the little things. Thousands and thousands of renders. A broken render farm that can’t be fixed until next year’s software update. The rig for Maria’s hands isn’t right, and they have to work joint by joint. The students and Barb can recollect this phase pretty clearly: a long slog, they call it. The swamp.
January means completing 95% of the animation so they can move on to final lighting and rendering. Communication among the team members is constant. Barb says, “We texted our latest , but nobody wants to make decisions in a text thread, and it wouldn’t be a good idea anyway. When we got together, everyone had so much respect for the other people at the table, and you’d hear ‘good enough, good enough’ go around the room. For some decisions, we just let time run out, and that’s not always a bad way to do things. If nobody proposes something different to what’s currently on the table, that’s the way it goes.”
Lighting is being adjusted and finessed even as the final 5% of animation is winding down. At first, it’s the lighting for a room, a whole scene; later, it gets adjusted in minute detail, shot by shot. “Every technical detail is there to tell a better story,” Kenji says. “Animation tells a visual story, designed to create emotion, empathy, through these technical details. Throughout the project, Barb gave incredible feedback for ongoing improvement, and she had such dedication and belief that we could complete this."
Lighting tests continue until the clock runs out, but Barb remembers the end of animation as a milestone. Her family remembers it as the time period where they’d ask her what was for dinner and she’d think it was still lunchtime. “At this point in the project,” she says, “we had almost all the pieces, but it still takes hundreds of hours to go from 90% to 100%. Whether it gets done depends on the huge dedication of the students who continue to work on the project even after the official course is over.”
Late spring is for foley recording, sound effects, making sure the little details that add realism don’t overshadow the expressive score. Lighting and shading are still being tweaked all the way into May. Glass objects are still too bright; remembering that particular struggle, Barb puts her hand to her mouth and pretends to shout across a room: “Someone turn down that jar!”
And then one day, it’s done. (That day is May 17, the day before the screening.)
“Pretty crazy” is how Nellie describes the screening. “It was the first time a lot of us had seen it final-final, with music, sound effects, color correction.”
“I couldn’t stop thinking about the computer hours that had gotten crunched,” Kenji remembers. “We had only 20 computers working on the short, 10,000 frames and about an hour to render each frame – around 10,000 computer hours to just render it once. And we got up to version 5 or 6 of most shots. There were so many points when it seemed like we wouldn’t finish or it wouldn’t be up to the standard we were looking for. So I was really, really proud of it. It didn’t hit me until the screening that it was a Brown/RISD first.”
“It reminded me that I really like doing,” Barb says. “A lot of what faculty members do is help students do things, so it was wonderful to be in the zone and get stuff done. I went into animation in the first place because I wanted to make things.”
Animation A Bit Differently
With those numbers alone (10,000 frames, 10,000 hours of rendering), Toymaker astounds the layperson, but what about the expert? A week after its debut, Barb shows the short to eight alums at Commencement. Some of them have known her for her entire teaching career.
“When I saw the video file that Barb was opening, my jaw dropped,” says Mike Ravella. Now a Technical Director at Pixar, he came to Brown with no experience in art or computer graphics. “It was just incredible. You never see students even at the top animation schools do seven-minute shorts.”
“It was always competitive to get into Barb’s classes,” he remembers, “but these kids are insanely more qualified than we were. When one of my friends and I made our short, we tried to be conservative. We put a lot of love into it, and we were so excited to make something, but it still didn’t come out as well as we’d hoped. Toymaker is what I wanted to do, but that team of people didn’t exist that year. It does now, and the community that Barb has fostered is only on the rise. It’s self-sustaining: with more grads, students see more and more role models, so the career path looks viable to them.”
But the biggest challenge, Mike says, is animation’s barrier to entry: “And I want to see more kids get this opportunity, because Barb does such a great job breaking that barrier down! But she can only do so much teaching alone. When I heard that Toymaker was more about collaborating with friends and less about winning awards, it reminded me how Barb does animation a bit differently. She has the same focus on craft as other schools, but this is deeply personal for her. Animation is art to Barb, and anything from her students has a lot more heart, and it speaks to people better than something thrown together for a demo reel.”
The proof that it’s speaking to people occurs at that very same screening. Stunned by a plot twist, an alum’s five-year-old son voices his thoughts in a whisper heard throughout the room: “She’s breaking all the things the mom made!”
I Hope It Happens Again
The posters went up a few days before the screening.
Brown and RISD get credit at the top, the thirteen names are all the same size at the bottom, and just below that is a tiny postscript, a point of pride in technique and local habitation: “ARTISANALLY RENDERED IN PROVIDENCE, RI”. The title appears in gleaming white script, but the scene is subdued, even dim. Mother and daughter are sitting on the floor with a book, Angela stretching a little as kids do to make up for lack of height. Light is coming from stage left, but the sun is low. Near the ceiling the blue-green wall is black. The white mopboard has gone pink; soon it’ll be gray. Disrupting any sense of staginess or calculation in the pose or the scene, the animators have tucked one of Angela’s drawings behind her head, semi-obscured, throwing off the symmetry a little. All the months of work have culminated with a complete lack of pretense.  
“There’s a reason why we were able to do it,” Barb says. “I put a structure in place that made it possible to be successful, and we had the right group of students. After working ten or twelve hours in the lab, they’d go to a movie together. They’re friends who deeply cared about the project and each other.”
So, what’s next for Nellie? “I don’t know,” she says, but it has to involve computer graphics tools and collaboration. “You can’t do this work alone.” She pauses. “I’m glad this actually happened. I hope it happens again.”
“I hope so, too,” says Ben. “I hope Barb’s willing to put up with me again!”
Months later, three words recur when we ask Barb if there’s anything else to say: “I don’t know. I just re-rendered the video today, actually. I'd love to run the class again and make another short, but it's tricky because I have my other courses to teach. A project like this requires a lot of specific creativity and problem-solving to produce a quality film, compared to a typical two-week learning assignment in the intro course where mistakes are small and soon forgotten. It'd be great to have someone else come in and teach the intro course on a visiting basis now and then. But this was really a showpiece for what Brown CS can do. It was aspirational, but we had specific things in place to make it work. Based on what we learned, projects like this can only get better.”
And she’s been doing this for more than three decades. The best gardeners, Barb admits, are people in their sixties and seventies, because they’ve seen more growing conditions. A grin breaks out: “Yeah, I’d like to do something like this again.”
It’s the last week of summer and everyone’s coming back to campus. The screening was almost four months ago, but the posters are still hanging up in the CIT (mother and daughter leaning close in that late light) and new students will see them. Some won’t make the cut for CS 125 but will get in next year, some won’t get as far as they wanted in four years but make it to Pixar anyway, and some will have the idea and form the team and Barb will have to start drinking more coffee again.
Four months later and counting, nobody seems in any hurry to take them down.
Bloating, or adding unnecessary functionality to software that damages its performance or ease of use, probably started very soon after the first program was written. For most of us, the reaction is mostly frustration: we only want to make a playlist, or write a letter, and we're distracted by virtual assistants that were intended to be helpful, or we can't find the option we want because the menu has swelled with choices.  
But Professor Vasileios Kemerlis of Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) sees a much bigger problem: "More code means a larger attack surface, and more vulnerabilities. It's no different than trying to protect a mansion against intruders instead of a tiny shed." His work with Georgios Portokalidis of Stevens Institute of Technology and Junfeng Yang of Columbia University has just won a shared $3,200,000 grant from the Office of Naval Research (ONR). "Our proposal," he explains, "uses new methods and tools to reduce the attack surface of deployed binary applications, and then we take advantage of the reduced surface to secure them by adding a breadth of targeted defenses."
Their project, ABIDES (Adaptive BInary DEbloating and Security), views attack surface as a multifaceted concept and aims to reduce it by:
To quantify the benefits of reducing the attack surface, Kemerlis and his colleagues will devise metrics that go beyond code size and consider qualitative aspects of the removed or disabled code. Once they reduce the attack surface and identify its various facets, protecting the resultant software becomes much simpler, so they intend to follow that insight by creating effective defenses for debloated software, extending their previous work on continuous code randomization and control-flow integrity (CFI).
"We're very excited about this," Vasileios says. "Beyond simply removing unused code and functionality, we're developing fine-grained, dynamic debloating techniques, and we think our work will truly improve the state of the art in attack surface reduction for binaries and the OS kernel."
It's still a hypothetical, but easy to imagine: high school students and their families, about to take on thousands of dollars in loans and nervous about how the money will be spent, turn to a national database that details projected costs and financial outcomes. A few keystrokes later, they've entered enormous amounts of sensitive information, from a social security number and a street address to someone's employment history and financial status. That data is enormously attractive to hackers, and who's protecting it?
To address this, Senators Wyden, Rubio, and Warner introduced new legislation (the "Student Right to Know Before You Go Act") that offers more transparency for the costs and outcomes associated with higher education. Just as importantly, it requires use of a technique known as secure multi-party computation (MPC), which protects sensitive information by allowing parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private.
Professor Seny Kamara of Brown University’s Department of Computer Science (Brown CS), who served as a technical advisor on the bill, says, "This is significant because we believe this bill is the first of its kind in requiring a privacy-preserving system based on MPC. It's an important moment: the government at its highest level has begun to realize that whenever we collect sensitive data, there have to be privacy protections in place, and those protections need to use the best and most modern cryptographic  techniques."
Seny expects that the legislation will have a large impact not just on education but on technology and privacy. He says, "This shows that the benefits of big data can be obtained without compromising sensitive data. By integrating state-of-the-art privacy technologies, this bill illustrates what can be achieved when good policy and advanced technology combine."
The Associated Press describes it as "an interaction in which the human is needed" and researchers from Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) and Humanity-Centered Robotics Initative (HCRI) have some very important and very human interactivity in mind for their new partnership with entertainment leader Hasbro. They're working on a robotic cat with the aim of having it serve as a companion to older people and assist them with simple tasks.
The research is known as ARIES (Affordable Robotic Intelligence for Elderly Support), and it aims to add artificial intelligence capabilities to a product that Hasbro has already had on the market for two years. Without overpromising (the cat will never prepare meals or even navigate a house), they hope to expand its capabilities to include a small set of tasks that can be challenging for older adults, such as remembering medications or finding lost objects. The ultimate goal is allowing seniors to maintain their quality of life and stay in their homes longer.

Even as autonomous robots get better at doing things on their own, there will still be plenty of circumstances where humans might need to step in and take control. New software developed by Brown University computer scientists enables users to control robots remotely using virtual reality, which helps users to become immersed in a robot’s surroundings despite being miles away physically.
The software connects a robot’s arms and grippers as well as its onboard cameras and sensors to off-the-shelf virtual reality hardware via the internet. Using handheld controllers, users can control the position of the robot’s arms to perform intricate manipulation tasks just by moving their own arms. Users can step into the robot’s metal skin and get a first-person view of the environment, or can walk around the robot to survey the scene in the third person — whichever is easier for accomplishing the task at hand. The data transferred between the robot and the virtual reality unit is compact enough to be sent over the internet with minimal lag, making it possible for users to guide robots from great distances.
“We think this could be useful in any situation where we need some deft manipulation to be done, but where people shouldn’t be,” said David Whitney, a graduate student at Brown who co-led the development of the system. “Three examples we were thinking of specifically were in defusing bombs, working inside a damaged nuclear facility or operating the robotic arm on the International Space Station.”
Whitney co-led the work with Eric Rosen, an undergraduate student at Brown. Both work in Brown’s Humans to Robots lab, which is led by Stefanie Tellex, an assistant professor of computer science. A paper describing the system and evaluating its usability was presented this week at the International Symposium on Robotics Research in Chile.
Even highly sophisticated robots are often remotely controlled using some fairly unsophisticated means — often a keyboard or something like a video game controller and a two-dimensional monitor. That works fine, Whitney and Rosen say, for tasks like driving a wheeled robot around or flying a drone, but can be problematic for more complex tasks.
“For things like operating a robotic arm with lots of degrees of freedom, keyboards and game controllers just aren’t very intuitive,” Whitney said. And mapping a three-dimensional environment onto a two-dimensional screen could limit one’s perception of the space the robot inhabits.
Whitney and Rosen thought virtual reality might offer a more intuitive and immersive option. Their software links together a Baxter research robot with an HTC Vive, a virtual reality system that comes with hand controllers. The software uses the robot’s sensors to create a point-cloud model of the robot itself and its surroundings, which is transmitted to a remote computer connected to the Vive. Users can see that space in the headset and virtually walk around inside it. At the same time, users see live high-definition video from the robot’s wrist cameras for detailed views of manipulation tasks to be performed.
For their study, the researchers showed that they could create an immersive experience for users while keeping the data load small enough that it could be carried over the internet without a distracting lag. A user in Providence, R.I., for example, was able to perform a manipulation task — the stacking of plastic cups one inside the others — using a robot 41 miles away in Cambridge, Mass.
In additional studies, 18 novice users were able to complete the cup-stacking task 66 percent faster in virtual reality compared with a traditional keyboard-and-monitor interface. Users also reported enjoying the virtual interface more, and they found the manipulation tasks to be less demanding compared with keyboard and monitor.
Rosen thinks the increased speed in performing the task was due to the intuitiveness of the virtual reality interface.
“In VR, people can just move the robot like they move their bodies, and so they can do it without thinking about it,” Rosen said. “That lets people focus on the problem or task at hand without the increased cognitive load of trying to figure out how to move the robot.”
The researchers plan to continue developing the system. The first iteration focused on a fairly simple manipulation task with a robot that was stationary in the environment. They’d like to try more complex tasks and later combine manipulation with navigation. They’d also like to experiment with mixed autonomy, where the robot does some tasks on its own and the user takes over for other tasks.
The researchers have made the system freely available on the web. They hope other robotics researchers might give it a try and take it in new directions of their own.
In addition to Whitney, Rosen and Tellex, other authors on the paper were Elizabeth Phillips, a postdoctoral researcher with Brown’s Humanity Centered Robotics Initiative, and George Konidaris, as assistant professor of computer science. The work was funded in part by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) (W911NF-15-1-0503, YFA: D15AP00104, YFA: GR5245014 and D15AP00102) and NASA (GR5227035).
The Paris C. Kanellakis Memorial Lecture, a seventeen-year tradition at Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS), honors Paris Kanellakis, a distinguished computer scientist who was an esteemed and beloved member of the Brown CS community. Paris came to Brown in 1981 and became a full professor in 1990. His research area was theoretical computer science, with emphasis on the principles of database systems, logic in computer science, the principles of distributed computing, and combinatorial optimization. He died in an airplane crash on December 20, 1995, along with his wife, Maria Teresa Otoya, and their two young children, Alexandra and Stephanos Kanellakis.
Each year, Brown CS invites one of the field's thought leaders to address wide-ranging topics in honor of Paris. Last year, Donald Knuth of Stanford University returned to Brown to give a "history of clever ideas that arose around the world” as he traced the evolution of a combinatorial problem dating back to antiquity. Just this week, on December 11, 2017, Piotyr Indyk of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology delivered the seventeenth annual Paris C. Kanellakis Memorial Lecture.
Indyk is a Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT. He joined MIT in 2000, after earning his PhD from Stanford University and his Magister degree from ​Uniwersytet Warszawski in 1995. His research interests lie in the design and analysis of efficient algorithms, and specific interests include high-dimensional computational geometry, sketching and streaming algorithms and sparse recovery. Indyk has received the Sloan Fellowship (2003), the Packard Fellowship (2003), and the Simons Investigator Award (2013). His work on Sparse Fourier Transform has been named to the Technology Review “TR10” in 2012, while his work on locality-sensitive hashing has received the 2012 ACM Kanellakis Theory and Practice Award.
Speaking in front of an enthusiastic crowd that filled CIT 368, Piotyr gave a lecture ("Below P vs. NP: Conditional Quadratic-Time Hardness for Big Data Problems") that worked outward from one of the key concepts of computational complexity, the theory of NP-hardness, to address some of the newest challenges presented by the era of Big Data. Quadratic-time algorithms, Indyk stated, can be inefficient when used on moderately-sized inputs, but lose their usefulness on problems that involve gigabytes or more of data. Using recent research in string processing and machine learning as evidence, he made the case that under a natural complexity-theoretic conjecture, there are no near-linear time algorithms for such problems, and he described how this framework has led to the development of new algorithms.
Professor James Tompkin of Brown CS, whose research is in graphics, vision, and interaction techniques, was one of the many attendees. Asked about Piotyr and his work, he says, "His and his colleagues work on analyzing complexity of empirical risk minimization is highly relevant to computer vision, as we often use supervised learning methods like SVM and neural networks. For instance, Indyk showed that quadratic time is required to compute the gradient of the empirical loss in neural nets."
Imagine a self-driving car zooming down the highway, or a robotic arm welding car parts in a factory. Suddenly, in less than a second, another car swerves in front of it, or a human trips and falls into the work area. The difference between a close shave and catastrophe will depend largely on one thing: the robot's reaction time. 
In 2016, Professor George Konidaris (then at Duke University) of Brown University's Department of Computer Science and Professor Dan Sorin of Duke University founded Realtime Robotics, focused on developing on a processor that would allow robots to perform motion-planning tasks at up to 10,000 times faster than previous speeds. Last month, the company secured $2 million in seed funding to further its growth. Key investors in the seed round include SPARX Group Ltd., Scrum Ventures, and Toyota AI Ventures, a venture capital subsidiary of Toyota Research Institute (TRI).
Realtime Robotics enables complex robotic motion planning tasks to be accomplished up to 10,000 times faster than previously possible using a proprietary special-purpose processor, allowing robotic systems to instantly react to their environments and compute how and where to move as their situation is changing. This groundbreaking ability to instantly plan motion in response to rapidly changing conditions overcomes one of the primary challenges preventing robots and autonomous vehicles from achieving their enormous potential.
“Realtime has set itself apart by providing a novel solution with far-ranging implications” says Tak Miyata, General Partner at Scrum Ventures.
Uses for Realtime's lightning-fast processor are wide-ranging: it enables robots with sophisticated arms to be utilized in dynamic environments, dramatically increasing the types of industrial tasks they can perform. It can also be used by autonomous vehicles to help them operate at normal speeds —like humans, but safer— instead of slowing to a crawl when there is uncertainty regarding other cars, bikes, or pedestrians.
"I'm very excited about the technology we're developing at Realtime," says George. "When I was young, programming video games was much harder, because an incredible amount of effort had to go into generating realistic graphics on quite slow hardware. GPUs changed all of that, and led to a massive burst of creativity and excitement in computing gaming. The processor Realtime is developing will do that for motion planning. At the moment it's slow and difficult to get right, so there are virtually no deployed applications. Once we're done, the processor will open up a whole new world of possibilities for robot automation."
Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) is glad to announce that applications are open for the Randy F. Pausch '82 Computer Science Undergraduate Summer Research Award, which provides $10,000 annually to support an undergraduate engaged in an intensive faculty-student summer research partnership at Brown CS.
Last year, the award went to Sorawee Porncharoenwase, who worked with Postdoctoral Reserach Associate Tim Nelson to use logic to aid users in verifying correctness of a system. He was introduced to software verification and programming languages at Brown and continued his interest in them by taking Logic for Systems with Tim, then TAing the course twice. Over the summer, he worked on program synthesis combined with past work that Tim, Professor Shriram Krishnamurthi, and their PhD student, Natasha Danas, have done on presenting the output of formal methods tools. 
To apply, no later than February 10, 2018, students should email Associate Professor (Research) and Vice Chair Tom Doeppner either: (A) a copy of their summer UTRA application or (B) a two-page description of their proposed research and a letter of support from the Brown CS faculty member that they intend to work with.
One of the things we hear most often from our alums is that they keenly remember the pressures and uncertainties as they approached Brown graduation and weighed their next step in life.  They want to share the experience that followed with the next generation, and our students who are getting ready to graduate are just as eager to pick up a few pointers at a crucial moment in their careers.
The Life After Brown series features successful Brown CS alums sharing their perspective on the challenges and opportunities that await our graduates in the hope that current students can benefit. The inaugural lecture was given by Adam Leventhal, now at Transposit, a subsequent lecture was delivered by Mary Fernandez of MentorNet, and next week, the series returns with Peter Norvig, Director of Research at Google, whose talk will be held in CIT 368 from 4-5 PM on Friday, November 17.
Peter is a Fellow of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence and the Association for Computing Machinery. At Google Inc he was Director of Search Quality, responsible for the core web search algorithms from 2002-2005, and has been Director of Research from 2005 on. Previously he was the head of the Computational Sciences Division at NASA Ames Research Center, making him NASA's senior computer scientist. He received the NASA Exceptional Achievement Award in 2001. He has served as an assistant professor at the University of Southern California and a research faculty member at the University of California at Berkeley Computer Science Department, from which he received a Ph.D. in 1986 and the distinguished alumni award in 2006. He has over fifty publications in Computer Science, concentrating on Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing and Software Engineering, including the books Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (the leading textbook in the field), Paradigms of AI Programming: Case Studies in Common Lisp, Verbmobil: A Translation System for Face-to-Face Dialog, and Intelligent Help Systems for UNIX. He is also the author of the Gettysburg Powerpoint Presentation and the world's longest palindromic sentence.
Peter's lecture will be aimed primarily at undergraduates, but all are welcome to attend.
A group of academic researchers, led by cognitive and computer scientists from Brown University, is teaming up with a cross-functional team from global play and entertainment leader Hasbro to design a smart robotic companion capable of assisting older people with simple but sometimes challenging tasks of everyday living.
The project, dubbed ARIES (Affordable Robotic Intelligence for Elderly Support), will add artificial intelligence capabilities to Hasbro’s current Joy for All Companion Pets — animatronic dogs and cats designed to provide interactive companionship, comfort and joy for older adults. The research team’s goal is to develop additional capabilities for the ARIES companions to help older adults with simple tasks that could include help in finding lost objects, medication reminders or other tasks that sometimes become challenging, especially those who may have mild dementia.
The work is supported by a $1 million grant from the National Science Foundation and will be led by Brown’s Humanity-Centered Robotics Initiative (HCRI), a group of computer and social science researchers who explore the societal opportunities and challenges presented by robotics. The academic project team also includes researchers from Brown’s Warren Alpert Medical School, Butler and Bradley hospitals in Providence, R.I., and the University of Cincinnati.
“Hasbro did a great job developing a product that can provide comfort and joy for older people,” said Bertram Malle, a professor in Brown’s Department of Cognitive, Linguistic and Psychological Sciences, co-director of HCRI and the principal investigator on the grant. “What we want to do now is leverage our expertise in cognitive and computer science to add capabilities to this robotic pet. Neither of us could do this on our own, but together we have the expertise to potentially develop something truly beneficial.”
Over the next three years, the group plans to perform a variety of user studies to understand how ARIES might best assist older adults. Then they’ll work on developing and integrating a variety of artificial intelligence technologies that will meet the needs identified in the user studies. These could include sensor systems that allow the ARIES companion to identify and keep track of important objects around the house, such as keys or eyeglasses, help the person remember important tasks and events, and enhance safety.
The team will also study means of effective communication between the ARIES companion and users.
“The Joy for All Companion Pets currently make some realistic pet sounds and gestures,” Malle said. “We may want to expand those capacities and add intelligence to them, so the companions give meaningful clues — gestures, nudges, purrs — that help to guide users toward misplaced objects or let them know that it’s time to do something.”
The early user studies will play a key role in how the project unfolds, Malle says.
“There are some things — like locating objects and taking medications — that we know from the literature people find useful,” he said. “But in our first year we want to find out what other challenges people face that we don’t know about, and then see if we can develop technologies to address them.”
One critical factor the researchers will keep in mind is cost.
“The ‘A’ in ARIES stands for ‘affordable,’ and that's something we're taking very seriously,” said Michael Littman, a professor of computer science at Brown and co-principal investigator on the grant. “This is one of the important reasons Hasbro is a great industry partner for this project. The current Joy for All pets cost roughly $100 while similar robotic products can cost $5,000 to $6,000. We want the ARIES robot to be available to anyone who needs it.”
Ultimately, the team hopes to complete a prototype and test it with target users by the end of the three project years. The researchers stress that they don’t intend this to be a technology that can take the place of human caregivers. They hope instead that it can complement the work of caregivers and help in a small way to meet the challenge presented by an aging population.
“To us, this project really represents what we do at HCRI, which is to let societal needs drive technology development,” Malle said. “We know that caring for an aging population will be a tremendous challenge in the coming years, and we think technologies like ARIES could play a small but potentially important role in helping people meet that challenge.”
Ted Fischer, vice president for business development at Hasbro, says the company has been excited by the response to its Joy for All line. “Social isolation and loneliness are growing issues for older adults and our companion pets make people smile, Fischer said. “Hasbro’s expertise in play and engaging experiences in collaboration with leading scientists from Brown’s HCRI is a powerful combination to explore additional impactful uses for ARIES companions.”
The research team will include Peter Haas, associate director of HCRI; HCRI postdoctoral researchers Maartje de Graaf and Elizabeth Philips; Michael Armey from Butler Hospital and Brown’s Warren Alpert Medical School; Gary Epstein-Lubow from Butler, Brown and Hebrew Senior Life; Claudia Rébola, an industrial design professor at the University of Cincinnati; Ron Seifer of Bradley Hospital; and a multidisciplinary team from Hasbro including designers, engineers and marketing professionals.
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has awarded four Brown University faculty members with Director’s Fellowships, which are given to the top performers among agency’s Young Faculty Award recipients.
David Borton, Amanda Jamieson, George Konidaris and Stefanie Tellex each won Young Faculty Awards in 2015, which provide up to $500,000 in research support over two years. The Director’s Fellowship provides a third year of funding of up to $500,000 to recipients who demonstrated “exceptional performance” over their first two years.
“The Young Faculty Award itself is highly competitive — these four faculty members were among only 24 awardees in DARPA’s class of 2015 — and the Director’s Fellows represent the best of the best,” said Jill Pipher, vice president for research at Brown. “Their innovative approaches in research may lead to transformative capabilities in immunology, robotics and neurotechnology.”
David Borton, assistant professor of engineering
Borton’s lab at Brown focuses on neurotechnologies that may one day restore movement in people who have been paralyzed by an injury or illness. His DARPA work aims to develop new lower-limb prosthetics that can do something no current artificial leg can do: provide sensory feedback to the nervous system. Having a sense of where our limbs are in space helps with balance, posture and fall-avoidance. Borton is developing the computational models necessary to recreate that sensory information, as well as a system that can write that information into the nervous system through mild electrical stimulation of the spine. During his third year of funding, Borton plans to expand the work to include stimulation in the brain, which could provide increased awareness of an artificial limb’s position in space.
Amanda Jamieson, assistant professor of molecular microbiology and immunology
The development of infection after injury or surgery is a serious problem for patients in civilian hospitals, but is especially challenging for warfighters given the nature of their injuries and the settings in which they are treated. While much medical research is focused on healing wounds and clearing infections, Jamieson’s research has a different but no less critical focus. She’s interested in ways to make people more resilient in the face of injury or infection—better able to weather the storm while healing takes place or an infection runs its course. For her DARPA project, Jamieson is looking at how lung infections influence the body’s ability to heal external wounds, in search of ways to make both skin and lung tissue more resilient to insult.
George Konidaris, assistant professor of computer science
Konidaris’ lab is working to develop intelligent, general-purpose robots. While the physical capabilities of robotic hardware have improved dramatically in recent years, the software side of robotics still lags a bit behind. Part of the problem, Konidaris says, is that robots still see the world essentially as sets of pixels. Getting a robot to translate those pixels into higher-level concepts — and then to associate concepts with appropriate actions — remains a challenge. Konidaris’ DARPA research aims to develop algorithms that help robots learn higher-level representations of the world — making the leap from pixels to abstract concepts — autonomously. Such algorithms could make robots much better at planning their actions in unstructured, real-world domains.
Stefanie Tellex, assistant professor of computer science
Tellex’s Humans to Robots lab is working to create robots that work collaboratively with people. Part of doing that requires developing better ways to communicate with robots. For her DARPA research, Tellex has been working on algorithms that enable robots to combine information from voice commands with information inferred from human gestures. People communicate in this way all the time. For example, when asking someone to hand them a tool, a person might say, "Could you hand me that wrench?" while pointing to the one they want. Tellex has shown that when robots combine speech and gesture they are able to perform fetching tasks more quickly and more accurately. In the third year of her DARPA award, she’ll continue to hone her algorithm using user studies and a mobile robot fetching objects in unfamiliar settings.
From a sea of 6,432 applicants from across the globe, two recent Brown University graduates landed honors among just 25 global winners cited for the top undergraduate research papers of 2017 as judged by the prestigious Undergraduate Awards.
Tushar Bhargava, a 2017 Brown CS graduate, earned top honors for the politics and international relations category with a paper titled “Partners in Crime: Telecommunication Companies and Intelligence Agencies.” Working with Timothy Edgar, a senior fellow at Brown’s Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, Bhargava examined the cooperation between telecomm companies and government agencies to shed light on the current privacy concerns raised by civil liberties activists.
Bhargava, a computer science concentrator originally from New Delhi, India, said that while the award is a personal achievement, it’s also a reflection of how Brown’s liberal arts education stands out from its peers.
“It is a testament to the value of the Open Curriculum,” Bhargava said. “Though the paper was in the international relations category, it was multidisciplinary because I relied on skills I learned through coursework in English, history, computer science and social psychology.”
Bhargava now works in Seattle, Wash., as a software engineer at Microsoft.
In the category of literature, fellow Class of 2017 graduate Noah Fields bested the competition with a paper titled “Men Reading Jane Austen: Close Writing Across Gender Scripts,” which examined cross-gender identification in the literature of Jane Austen and was a rethinking of the marriage plot using the vantage point of today’s same-sex marriage laws.
“I was taken completely by surprise when I found out my paper actually won, because I think it's a pretty risqué essay,” Fields said. “It was really affirming and humbling to get this kind of recognition.”
Fields, who is originally from Thousand Oaks, Calif., is currently a musician and poet living in Chicago.
Oludurotimi Adetunji, associate dean of the College for undergraduate research at Brown, said competition for the Undergraduate Awards is fierce and showcases the best work by college students from across the world.
“The Undergraduate Award is broadly known as the ‘junior Nobel Prize’ because the chances of being selected are less than 0.4 percent,” Adetunji said.
Adetunji was impressed by this year’s Brown candidates, whose papers were tailored from coursework and projects stemming from Brown’s Undergraduate Teaching and Research Awards program.
“The awards are an indication of the kind of academic excellence that results from Brown’s Open Curriculum and highlight the vast opportunities for students to engage in research at Brown,” Adetunji added.
The Undergraduate Awards program recognizes both undergraduate research and original student work. This year, a group of independent and international panel judges narrowed down the 6,432 submissions to name a single winner for 25 distinct categories. All winners came from a broader pool of 150 “highly commended” recipients.
Bhargava and Fields weren’t the only strong performers from Brown. The work of 17 other Brown students was also honored as “highly commended,” more than doubling the number of recipients from the University compared to last year. Two of those students, Emily Schwartz and Issac Kim, were also recognized as Regional Winners.
All 19 current and now graduated Brown students have been invited to attend the Undergraduate Awards Global Summit in Dublin this November, and the work of all winners will be published in the Undergraduate Journal.
A delegation from Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) has had a busy week at the Grace Hopper Celebration (GHC), an annual event that's become the world's largest gathering of women technologists. The conference was started in 1994 by Anita Borg and Telle Whitney as a forum to highlight the contributions of women in computing both in academia and industry, but its main aim is helping young women find a place in the field of CS.
Over the years, Brown CS participants have described the conference as a source of inspiration and resources as they try to close the gender gap, and this year was no different. Attendees have had a busy schedule: the week started with keynotes from speakers such as Melinda Gates and Fei-Fei Li, Professor and Director of Stanford University’s AI Lab and Chief Scientist at Google Cloud AI/ML, and has continued with workshops and talks on topics ranging from Community and Career to Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. This year, Brown CS alum Karen Catlin was an invited speaker, leading a special session about negotiating skills ("Learn to Negotiate And Stop Holding Yourself Back").
It's clearly been another successful GHC, and our community members have been delighted with the interest from women who want to learn more about studying CS at Brown and our work creating a diverse and inclusive environment in which all students, faculty, and staff can thrive. Reporting from the Brown CS booth, Lauren Clarke (Manager, Academic and IP Programs) says that visits from prospective students are at a record high.

When I got to Brown as a freshman, I knew I wanted to dive right into the startup scene. Since I can remember, I’ve always loved creating things and working on projects with teams. I had come to the first Hack@Brown as a senior in high school and it was a no-brainer to join the organizing team once I got to campus. I was also part of the first iteration of the Innovation Dojo, a semester-long workshop series for underclassmen by the Brown Entrepreneurship Program, and I immediately joined Brown EP as well.
Most of these initiatives were new, and I felt the entrepreneurship scene at Brown was catching sparks. I went to the fall career fair and there were a lot of big companies, but I felt it wasn’t as welcoming for freshmen, and I also didn’t see a clear way to apply to startups. I really wanted to feel the rush of working at a VC-backed startup, so through the hackNY Fellowship, I was fortunate to end up interning at a startup in NYC for the summer.
I felt Startup@Brown was a great way to expose more students to this thrilling world of startups and kick off the year by trying to start a fire.
Startup@Brown relies on a simple premise: connect students and startups. It’s a single idea, but the intention is threefold. First, demystify the process of founding a startup. Second, enable a great recruiting starting-point for both startups and students. And third, but not least, inspire, grow, and bring together the startup community on College Hill. We structured the conference around these goals.
Demystify The Process Of Founding A Startup
There’s been an explosion of interest on the startup world. In our first year, we only had spots for 250 students, but when we opened registration for a bit over 2 weeks, more than 500 students from Brown and RISD responded. In many of the responses and conversations, students said they had startup ideas but that they would like to learn more about the process of bringing them to reality.
We didn’t want Startup@Brown to be another 300-person lecture (apart from the keynote), so we took a more dynamic yet intimate approach, mirroring the idea of closeness and face-to-face contact in startups. We had workshops in which 20-30 students learned from startup leaders, from founders and CTOs of startups such as Teespring, Casper, and Figma, to venture capitalists such as Y Combinator, Techstars, and Andreessen Horowitz.  In total, we had 17 workshops ranging from “Building Your First Physical Product” to “Funding 101” to “User Experience”. Kevin Hale, partner at Y Combinator, one of the top startup incubators in the world, also held office hours for student startups.
Enable A Great Recruiting Starting Point
It’s hard for startups to access top talent the way big companies do. Startups have way less time and money to spend on recruiting than corporations. Big companies have full-time recruiters and startups have founders focusing on their product.
And for students, the application process to work at small startups is shrouded in mystery, if not nonexistent. In contrast to larger organizations, startups have no information about intern programs on their websites and only a few have visible job postings. Career fairs are usually filled with large companies and little to no startups.
Therefore, right after the opening keynote we had the Startup Fair, a startup-only career fair. Students had a chance to walk around, meet with startups and learn about their work, challenges, and career opportunities. Similar to a hackathon, students didn’t have to bring their resumes to each table — a student could choose to have her resume shared with all the companies before the event.
Inspire, Grow, And Bring Together The Startup Community On College Hill
The reason why some people go to Silicon Valley to start companies is because of the community. College Hill and Providence have an enormous potential for creative endeavors; it’s a very fertile ground that has cultivated many great entrepreneurs, startups, and social change, but we believe there’s always room for growth.
Many students said one of their favorite moments was meeting and interacting with like-minded people. Bringing close to 300 students and startup leaders together for a weekend in September made for a great start of the year.
Naturally, many of the founders, engineers, and designers were alums, and they brought plentiful experience and enthusiasm back to campus. The help of alums was one of the main catalysts for Startup@Brown: we were thrilled to see over 20 alums from the different startups back on campus.
We sent a survey after the event where we got some feedback from attendees. 79% of the students are now more inclined to start their own startup, including six students saying they were starting one after Startup@Brown, and 97% would consider working with at least one of the startups that came. Feedback from the startups included that it was their “favorite career-fair” and that “the focus on startups was a huge win because every student was very engaging”.
Out of another survey we sent in January, 59% of respondents interviewed with at least one Startup@Brown startup, and 37% got offers for a summer internship, full-time job, or non-summer internship.
The close interactions created new friendships and now a stronger startup community vibrates through College Hill. There has been a snowball effect: out of conversations with Y Combinator, a new Brown CS startup class, csciStartup started being offered in Spring 2016, taught by Prof. John Jannotti, supported by Y Combinator, and with guest lectures from some of Startup@Brown’s speakers.
Startup@Brown was hosted by Brown University’s Department of Computer Science and organized in collaboration with the student-clubs Hack@Brown and Brown Entrepreneurship Program. We owe special thanks to alums: Startup@Brown wouldn’t have been possible without you.
We learned a lot from the first iteration and are now onto our third! Registration closes on Sept. 22nd. Find out more at www.startupatbrown.org.
Brown CS grad students are invited to a launch event ("Empowering Collaboration / Expanding Networks") by Brown University's Data Science Initiative (DSI). It includes lunch, roundtables with data science-related research groups and institutes, a reception, and a keynote by Andrew Moore, Dean of Computer Science at Carnegie Mason University. 
Brown University Executive Master in Cybersecurity (EMCS) Academic Director Timothy Edgar has just published Beyond Snowden: Privacy, Mass Surveillance and the Struggle to Reform the NSA. Described as “a must read” by Siobhan Gorman, Wall Street Journal former intelligence reporter, the book is already being hailed as a landmark in our legal understanding of cybersecurity in today’s digitized borderless world.
In Beyond Snowden, Edgar —whose career in government coincided with Snowden’s tenure— grapples with many of the issues that consumed the former NSA contractor now in exile in Moscow. His book takes us on a journey through America’s surveillance state to find the answer to this central question: What should we do about mass surveillance?
Tim is a longtime civil liberties activist who worked inside the intelligence community for six years during the Bush and Obama administrations. He believes that the NSA’s programs are a profound threat to the privacy of everyone in the world. At the same time, he argues that mass surveillance programs can be made consistent with democratic values — if we make the hard choices needed to bring transparency, accountability, privacy, and human rights protections into complex programs of intelligence collection.
Although the NSA and other agencies already comply with rules intended to prevent them from spying on Americans, Edgar argues that these rules are inadequate for this century and outlines practical modern reforms.
To hear more from Tim on Beyond Snowden:
If we posit a not-so-distant future where robots are ubiquitous, it stands to reason that we need writers to ground portrayals of them in reality. We say good-bye to crazed androids from pulp magazines who inexplicably try to kidnap beautiful women, and we're equally skeptical of Hollywood depictions of an AI apocalypse that still prevail today. 
And first impressions matter, which is why Professor Stefanie Tellex of Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) has served as an advisor for a just-released children's picture book (My Friend Robot!) from Barefoot Books, written by Kate "Sunny Scribens" DePalma and illustrated by Hui Skipp. It's part of Barefoot's series of STEM titles for kids, and the public got an early glimpse of the book at July's Robotics: Science and Systems conference at MIT.
"My young son was a big motivation," Stefanie explains. "Having a kid has made me even more interested in robotics outreach to the general public, and teachers often ask me where to go for more information, what to do next."
Senior Editor at Barefoot Books, Kate explains that her husband, Dr. Nick DePalma, a scientist who specializes in human-robot interaction, recommended Stefanie as a partner. "I needed help," she says, "with making sure the text and artwork were reasonably scientifically accurate. Dr. Tellex reviewed both while they were in process to make sure they were 'accurate' despite depicting a somewhat fantastical humanoid robot." 
"I'd been a fan of Barefoot Books forever," says Stefanie, "so I knew that I'd love to help. I did some brainstorming about what robots are used for: space exploration, healthcare, manufacturing, and then I wrote some text to describe them. I also sent along some references and visual examples for things like Voyager 1, a Roomba, and a surgical robot."
The collaboration, Kate remembers, quickly grew from there. "Dr. Tellex was instrumental in helping create the educational endmatter that closes the book and building the content for two of the spreads from scratch. Writing the endmatter was a huge challenge, because it needs to stay relevant and not be outdated in a few years. This book emphasizes the human element of robotics — how we can work with robots and have different careers in robotics. We want to get young children interested in STEM/STEAM/STREAM fields!"
"Just seeing the proofs, the beautiful art, was so cool," Stefanie enthuses, clearly inspired by the collaboration. "Imagine kids realizing that Voyager 1, the manmade object that's traveled farthest from Earth, is a robot! 60 years after it was launched, it's still working. Its story is still unfolding for us today, right now."
"Stefanie was a joy to work with and totally critical to the process of creating the book," says Kate. "She helped us bring a whole new dimension of information and accuracy to it. And we have her to thank for the fun, computerless programming activity we included! We were thrilled to credit her prominently on the copyright page so readers, caregivers, and educators know how much care and thought went into the development of the book." 
It's clear that Stefanie feels the same way. "On top of publishing diverse and inclusive books, Barefoot is known for getting their facts straight, and that's important to me. It was great to interact with someone who knows kids, what they need and how they learn. It's exciting to me that there's this wide open space for us to educate the public. Parents really need things like this."

"Humans make hundreds of routine decisions daily," explains Professor Amy Greenwald of Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS). "More often than not, the impact of our decisions depends on the decisions of others. As AI progresses, we're offloading more and more of these decisions to artificial agents. My research is aimed at building AI agents that make effective decisions in environments inhabited by both human and artificial agents."
On July 18, Amy gave a keynote address  ("The Interplay of Agent and Market Design") at Microsoft's Faculty Summit 2017 ("The Age of AI"). The event, now in its eighteenth year, brings together thought leaders and researchers from a broad range of disciplines, including computer science, the social sciences, human design and interactions, and policy. This year's goal was to highlight some of the key challenges posed by artificial intelligence and identify the next generation of approaches, techniques, and tools that will be needed to develop AI to solve the world’s most pressing challenges.
In her talk, Amy explained how current efforts in building AI agents have become increasingly relevant to economic domains, mostly in the service of perfecting market designs. She explained a mathematical connection between auctions and contests, and then observed that productivity can be maximized by rewarding not only the very best submissions, but rather by promising to reward any one of the top (for example) quarter of the submissions. She also discussed the importance of inverse reinforcement learning to market design, where the goal is to extract underlying motivations from agent behaviors. She concluded by touching on AI agent design in applications, ranging from renewable energy markets to online ad exchanges to wireless spectrum auctions.

Less than one year after launching its Data Science Initiative (DSI), Brown University has been awarded a $1.5 million grant by the National Science Foundation to establish a new research institute aimed at developing mathematical and computational tools for data-driven discovery.
Brown’s award is one of 12 nationwide Transdisciplinary Research in Principles of Data Science (TRIPODS) grants announced by the NSF on Aug. 24, 2017. The grants represent a $17.7 million commitment to developing “state-of-the-art mathematical and statistical tools, better data mining and machine learning approaches, enhanced visualization capabilities and more,” according to an agency statement.
“Brown’s Data Science Initiative was formed with the mission of bringing together people from pure and applied mathematics, statistics, computer science and elsewhere to develop new tools for applying data to complex problems,” said Jeffrey Brock, professor of mathematics and director of the DSI. “It’s gratifying that our approach to data science is so closely aligned with NSF’s vision. This award plants a flag for Brown as a place that excels in this kind of collaborative research in data science.”
The three-year grant will support intensive research activity and workshops bringing top researchers from higher education and industry to campus to work with experts on the Brown faculty. The work of Brown’s institute will focus on ways to improve the predictive power of mathematical and computational models of complex systems in the real world.
Brock noted that work in each of the institute’s three research themes will be geared toward real-world application in a wide variety of domains, from better understanding gene-environment interactions, to understanding outcomes of public policy decisions, to better ways of recognizing injury or disease from CT scans and MRIs. Over the course of the grant, those three themes will guide the development of:
The grant will also support intensive two-week immersion sessions for graduate students and faculty to learn about theoretical developments in one of the TRIPODS focus areas. These sessions, as well as end-of-semester workshops, will be hosted at ICERM, Brown’s NSF-funded mathematics institute. The grant also supports disseminated research results to the broader public through BrownX, the University’s online learning initiative.
“Brown’s DSI is motivated by the idea that the application of data to real-world problems should drive our theoretical and foundational work,” Brock said. “That will also motivate the work we do as a TRIPODS institute.”
Brock will serve as the grant’s principal investigator and TRIPODS institute director. Stuart Geman, professor of applied mathematics; Joseph Hogan, chair of biostatistics; Bjorn Sandstede, professor of applied mathematics; and Eli Upfal, professor of computer science will serve the grant’s co-investigators. The grant leaders will work with a broad network of researchers across campus who will contribute to TRIPODS research.
The $1.5 million award is the first phase of TRIPODS funding. Phase I institutes are invited to submit proposals to become larger Phase II institutes after three years.
“The pace of change in the data science field is extremely rapid, and we think that the collaborative approach to research that we’ve established with DSI and now with TRIPODS is the right way to keep pace, Brock said. “We’re looking forward to getting started.”
The ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing (PODC) is perhaps the most prominent international forum on the theory, design, analysis, implementation, and application of distributed systems and networks. Its common goal is to improve understanding of the principles underlying distributed computing.
Each year's conference gathers the field's thought leaders, and prominent among them this year was Professor Maurice Herlihy of Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS), who delivered a keynote address ("Blockchains and the Future of Distributed Computing"). After winning the crowd over with a humorous review of recent headlines in the cryptocurrency world, Maurice quickly turned serious, situating blockchain technology squarely in the world of distributed computing and looking at applications that he believes will have a pervasive effect on how we live. 
The ACM has kindly hosted Maurice's slide presentation here (PPTX format).
From a deluge of job openings to new university programs, Data Science has become a hot topic. But if it’s so important, why wait until a student enters university to introduce it?
Children are natural data scientists! They argue about who was the greatest quarterback, the most successful singer, which chain has the best pizza. These questions quickly shift to data: did athlete X win more trophies than athlete Y, are Grammy nominations or albums-sold a better indicator of talent, and so on. As they mature, they want to know whether a law is racist, or whether the outcomes of going to a particular college justify the extra student loans. In a world that’s data-rich, what these students need isn’t data. It’s the ability to ask questions and make meaning from that data.
Bootstrap, founded and co-led by three current Brown CS faculty/staff members, is one of the only groups in the CS Education field that builds our own curriculum, software, and programming tools. This gives us a unique opportunity to fill that gap, with a programming language that makes operations on tabular data (literally, spreadsheets) accessible without the overhead of teaching loops. We’ve leveraged our world-class language development team to bring rigorous Data Science to an introductory computing module. And since our unit of data storage is a spreadsheet, there’s a smooth on-ramp for teachers who are comfortable with Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets.
You can learn more about Bootstrap in the expandable sections below:
Professor Eli Upfal of Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) and Michael Mitzenmacher of Harvard University have just released a significantly larger second edition of their widely-used textbook, Probability and Computing: Randomization and Probabilistic Techniques in Algorithms and Data Analysis. It's already receiving high praise from experts in the field: Stanford University's Donald E. Knuth says, "This textbook provides a rigorous yet accessible introduction to fundamental concepts that need to be widely known. The new chapters in this second edition, about sample size and power laws, make it especially valuable for today's applications." Richard Karp of University of California, Berkeley, explains that his favorite course that he's taught at Berkeley is one based on Probability and Computing: "Students appreciate the clarity and crispness of the arguments and the relevance of the material to the study of algorithms." 
Readers of the book need only an elementary background in discrete mathematics, and the new material covers such topics as normal distributions, sample complexity, VC dimension, Rademacher complexity, power laws and related distributions, cuckoo hashing, and the Lovasz Local Lemma. A full list of contents includes:
Eli explains that the book's new subtitle (it changes from "Randomizing Algorithms and Probabilistic Analysis" to "Randomization and Probabilistic Techniques in Algorithms and Data Analysis") is significant. "The new material is mostly related to the theory of machine learning and data analysis," he says, "following their growing importance in CS. We want students to learn the best modern techniques and applications, so we provide many new exercises and examples, including programming-related ones that provide training in solving these kinds of problems."

It is with great sadness that we share the news that Peter Wegner, Professor Emeritus of Computer Science, passed away this morning following a brief illness. Peter came to Brown almost fifty years ago, in 1969, and we remember him with great respect not just as educator, theorist, historian, and researcher, but as one of the founding members of Brown CS.
Born in St. Petersburg to Austrian parents, Peter was present in Vienna for the terrifying days of the Anschluss and Kristallnacht, and escaped the Holocaust on the special trains known as Kindertransports. Graduating from Regent Street Polytechnic in London, he studied mathematics at Imperial College of London University, organizing the University of London Philosophical Study Group, which sponsored lectures by such luminaries as C.E.M. Joad, J.B.S. Haldane, and Karl Popper. This interest in philosophy continued throughout Peter’s life, and philosophical analysis was a frequent component of his scientific work.
Later, at Cambridge University, Peter completed a graduate program in Numerical Analysis and Automatic Computing, also working with Professor Maurice Wilkes on the EDSAC computer, now widely seen as the first practical general-purpose stored-program electronic computer. It was during his stay at Cambridge that Peter met his future wife, the late Judith Romney, and received a Post-Graduate Diploma in Numerical Analysis and Automatic Computing at a time when there were no Master’s or doctoral programs in computer science anywhere. He is believed to be one of the world’s first two or three CS postgraduates.
After working at the Prudential Insurance Company, Pennsylvania State University, MIT (Wegner worked with Fernando Corbato on the Multics project, for which Corbato would later receive a Turing award), the London School of Economics, and Cornell University, Peter came to Brown in 1969, accepting a position with tenure. During his time at Brown CS, he supervised six doctoral students and taught numerous courses, particularly in the areas of programming languages, software engineering, and theoretical computer science.
Peter was the author of several books, including Programming Languages, Information Structures, and Machine Organization, one of the significant texts of the discipline’s early history, concerned with the very nature of computing. He continued writing until his death, publishing Interactive Computation: the New Paradigm (with Dina Goldin and Scott A. Smolka) in 2008.
He was also the editor of the ACM Curriculum Committee’s Curriculum 1968, which provided recommendations for CS academic programs. It was an effort more than a half-decade in the making, and its effects on computer science education are still being felt today. Peter’s close involvement with the organization continued for decades: he served on multiple committees, led its Publications division, and was later named a Fellow of the ACM and given a Distinguished Service Award for “focusing the field’s intellectual energy” through his commitment to research and publishing. Four years later, he received the Austrian Cross of Honor for Science and Art, 1st Class. For more than a decade, he was also one of two editors of the Brown University Faculty Bulletin, where he wrote on Russian literature and continued his love of philosophy with essays on Popper and Russell.
“I have always been in a position,” Peter Wegner once said, “of trying to understand new ideas when they entered my life.” Interviewed just a year before his death, he urged computer scientists to focus on the opportunities of the field: “Sometimes we work too hard trying to do things we can’t do and neglect the things we can. In computer science we work with possibilities and hope we’ll someday be able to solve them.”  
Brown CS sends our condolences to the entire Wegner family. Peter was a founder and a friend, and we have benefited for decades from his eagerness to contribute, his participation through questioning, and his hope of unifying bodies of knowledge. He will be greatly missed and long remembered.

The continued expansion of Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) has brought an important milestone: an Associate Chair will now assist Department Chair Ugur Cetintemel with important duties, and Professor John "Spike" Hughes will fill the role. Professor Tom Doeppner continues in his role as Vice-Chair.
"Things don't always scale up nicely," John explains. "Doubling in size as a department actually means four or eight or sixteen times as many things to do. Ugur has done a really wonderful job, with Tom's huge help, but the workload has gotten to be too much." He's looking forward to being a "sanity check" and sounding board, helping with tasks and giving feedback on ideas that are important but don't require the attention of the Executive Committee.
As one example of an early task, Spike explains that he'll be helping allocate faculty members to the various Brown CS committees in late summer.  "It's mostly mechanical," he says, but no doubt it's still a considerable balancing act, and a careful weighing of preferences and aptitudes and workloads. A bigger effort will be to work with the faculty to conduct a self-study of Brown CS, looking at strengths, weaknesses, obstacles, and opportunities. It's the groundwork for a detailed review that Brown conducts approximately every five years to guide its academic departments and help them make improvements.
What does this change of roles mean for his career? "It might end it!" he jokes, but quickly turns serious. "My whole career has been a little peculiar. I was trained to be a mathematician, so nobody taught me how to teach, or to run a research group. Likewise, I haven't been trained in administrative work, but I've seen enough of what happens here to know what goes on, and I have a pretty strong sense of fairness. I'll be relying on that to be my guide when tricky things come up." 
If there's one thing John wants to do, he says, it's simplify, looking at every aspect of the items that cross his desk and asking if they're all necessary. "If I find that we've been asking what a particular committee has done for the past five years, it might be a good choice to get rid of it and talk about the same issues over coffee."
Few are likely to object, and faculty, students, and staff have already started sharing their enthusiasm for Spike's energy and skill. "I'm truly grateful to John for his willingness to serve in this demanding role," says Ugur. "I've had the privilege to work with him closely as part of our Executive Committee, and have always been informed and inspired by his exceptional wisdom and intellect. At a time when CS has become a central discipline for all and our department has become the largest at Brown, getting Spike's help in this leadership role will let us better address the needs of our increasingly bigger and more diverse community."
When John Savage came to Brown a half-century ago, computing was thought of as a service, not a discipline, and the idea of a Department of Computer Science at Brown was highly controversial.  Few could have predicted the infrastructure necessary today, or the challenges we face in the areas of cryptography, cybereconomics, big data, and many others. One of the founders of Brown CS, John's interests have changed as our field has changed, leading him to contribute to such areas as computational complexity, scientific computation, computational nanotechnology, and cybersecurity policy and technology.  
On Friday, May 26, 2017, we held a special event to celebrate how John Savage and Brown CS have evolved together. Speakers that included Brown University President Christina Paxson, Senator Jack Reed, and several of John's students and colleagues gave research talks and shared personal reminiscences.
Video recordings of all talks are available here.
Professor Shriram Krishnamurthi of Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) has just accepted a four-year commitment to serve on the Editorial Board of the Research Highlights section of Communications of the ACM (CACM-RH), which is devoted to publishing the most important and interesting CS research of recent years.
Chosen for the depth of his expertise and breadth of his research areas, Shriram will identify and nominate papers for consideration, assess nominations that fall within his interests, contribute to CACM-RH internal governance, communicate with authors, and facilitate the creation of the technical perspectives that accompany articles. 
Shriram will serve alongside 26 thought leaders in the field from both academia and industry, a list of luminaries that runs from Abadi to Zeller. Former members of the Editorial Board include Professor Maurice Herlihy of Brown CS and Brown CS alum David Salesin.
"I'm delighted, of course," says PhD candidate Esha Ghosh of Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS). "There are so many reasons, but this is special to me because it focuses on underrepresented groups. It reinforces the confidence of young women that they belong in STEM fields."
It's a significant moment: Esha is among the inaugural recipients of the Microsoft Research Dissertation Grant, which targets members of underrepresented groups in computing who are past their fourth year in a PhD program at a US or Canadian university. "Awards were made based on the technical merit and potential for impact of the proposed dissertation research," explains Meredith Ringel Morris, Principal Researcher and Chair of the Microsoft Research Dissertation Grant Program. "We had the difficult task of awarding only a few grants from the nearly 200 applications we received, so this was a very selective and competitive process."
Esha's work focuses on cloud computing and security: in a world where increasingly organizations and and individuals outsource data storage and application processing to the cloud, she is developing innovative solutions that allow users to benefit from cloud computing to get quick, verifiable, and tamper-proof answers that don't reveal unnecessary information to the cloud provider. Esha is advised by Professor Roberto Tamassia and expects to complete the requirements for her PhD by the summer of 2018.
The grant will fund her research (the working title is "Efficient, Secure, Privacy-Preserving Cloud Storage and Computation") in the amount of $20,000. Among other things, Esha expects to use it to hire interns to help complete the implementation of her prototype system. She and the other recipients will be visiting Microsoft Research’s headquarters in Redmond, Washington for a two-day career workshop on November 13 and 14, where they'll have the opportunity to present their dissertation work and receive feedback and career advice from a panel of Microsoft’s research scientists. "I'm also excited about the chance to present my work and get feedback," says Esha. "It's a great mentoring opportunity."
Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) has just added another new faculty member: Ellie Pavlick is joining us as Assistant Professor in the summer of 2018. “I’m still interested in economics,” she says (Ellie has a BA in that field and a BM in saxophone performance), “but I felt like it was much messier.” Maybe so, but after sitting down to talk for an hour, it’s clear that Pavlick in no way finds messiness to be a source of discomfort. An expert in crowdsourcing and paraphrasing, studying language in all its complexity has allowed her to use what she calls a problem-driven approach, combining sprawling interests in a world where no two words mean the same thing.
If you think that description sounds like a good fit for Brown University, you’re not alone. “I love the broad interests at Brown,” says Ellie. “Understanding language is a deep, difficult interdisciplinary problem. Academia lets you play that long game. And getting to work with students means less uniformity. Each student has their own interests, so they help you get involved with a lot of different things.”
Pavlick’s own involvement with computer science came surprisingly late. “I’ve always been interested in multiple things,” she says. “I find it hard to feel fulfilled with just one area. I think if I’d really had a chance to explore CS in high school, I would’ve gone into it sooner because it provides this common skill set that can be applied to so many areas.” During undergraduate studies at Johns Hopkins, using LaTeX and MATLAB sparked Ellie’s interest in the field. Soon after, participation in Women in CS events helped her find an advisor and start new research projects. After graduation, when one of her professors transferred to University of Pennsylvania, she followed, giving up plans for a Master’s in favor of a PhD.
Natural language processing and crowdsourcing appealed to Pavlick from the beginning: “People speak and understand human language, not programming languages, which is what computers quote-unquote ‘speak’. I find it really exciting: our language is very complex, and it’s not designed for talking to computers. It’s full of not just commands but implications and feelings. Can we get computers to unpack all of that implicit meaning?”
Driven by my own interests, I pull Ellie into a side discussion of writerly craft and whether any two words can mean exactly the same thing. Does she see herself as a writer? “Definitely. I like working with language because it’s an incredible mix of structure and freedom. I used to think I’d end up as more of an artsy person...even when I write up research, which I guess is technical writing, I really enjoy it and probably overthink it. People can be very imprecise with language, but we can also be very particular about how we say what we say. That has gotten less attention from an AI perspective. People write and speak with the expectation that the reader or listener is a human, so we use a lot of hints and cues to indicate our opinions and impressions and these are completely lost on computers.”
And that person-to-computer communication, ultimately at a seamless level, is coming, Ellie thinks, but the timeframe is tough to estimate. “We’ve made incredible progress in AI on things that look like language understanding,” she says, “but the models are shallow. As a field, we’ve just started a conversation about modeling intents and goals, but computers haven’t even begun to understand how human language expresses differing personalities and similar but distinct goals.”
The way to get there, Pavlick says, is to make computer science even more interdisciplinary than it already is: “We can’t just keep cranking away at what we’re doing. Natural language processing is a young field, and it’s hard to predict what kind of knowledge is needed next. People coming into CS with different interests and perspectives provides the raw ingredients we need for progress, for the next advance.”
And having a different methodology is equally important. “One question I get a lot,” Ellie says, “is if deep learning will solve all of our problems. ‘Isn’t language solved?’ As computer scientists, we sometimes fall into this love affair with a certain method. We find an exciting model and start looking for things to apply it to, and then want to report on what’s going well. What I like about Brown is the problem-driven approach, which drives you to collaborate and forces you to question and to choose the best methods from a large, interdisciplinary set of possible methods. Research should be based around the things we don’t know how to do.”
In a recent letter to the Brown University community, President Christina H. Paxson announced the appointment of sixteen faculty members to named chairs. Professor Stefanie Tellex of the Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) was among them: she becomes the Joukowsky Family Assistant Professor of Computer Science, alongside colleagues from the Departments of Physics, Anthropology, Environmental Studies, and others.
"I'm really honored by the recognition from the University," Stefanie says, "and I thank the Joukowsky family for their generosity. This is not just a nod to me, but to all the students and postdocs working beside me in the lab, as well as to all the wonderful support staff here at Brown. Their hard work and creativity are the reason for our success."
Stefanie has been a Brown CS faculty member since 2013, and her research aims to create robots that collaborate with people to meet their needs, so that human-robot collaboration approaches the ease of human-human collaboration. To create collaborative robots, her Humans To Robots Laboratory focuses on three key challenges: 1) perceiving the world using the robot’s sensors; 2) communicating with people to understand their needs and how to meet them; and 3) acting to change the world in ways that meet people’s needs.
She's the third named chair for Brown CS in the past two years, following Eugene Charniak (University Professor of Computer Science), Maurice Herlihy (An Wang Professor of Computer Science), Sorin Istrail (Julie Nguyen Brown Professor of Computational and Mathematical Science), Franco Preparata (An Wang Professor of Computer Science), Eli Upfal (Rush C. Hawkins Profesor of Computer Science), and Andy van Dam, (Thomas J. Watson Jr. University Professor of Technology and Education).
"We're very happy to see this recognition," says Department Chair Ugur Cetintemel. "Stefanie has been pursuing an ambitious research agenda with success and it's wonderful to see Brown acknowledging her achievements after just four years at Brown CS."
Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) has made it our mission to create and sustain a diverse and inclusive environment in which all students, faculty, and staff can thrive. Few things are more meaningful than to see our female-identifying students become known leaders and role models in the field, and Brown CS undergraduate Tiffany Chen has just received significant recognition: she's been named a Women Techmakers Scholar. The award is part of Google's Women Techmakers Scholars Program, which aims at furthering Anita Borg’s vision of creating gender equality in the field of computer science.  
Last year, Brown CS student Julia Wu was a recipient of the scholarship (formerly known as the Google Anita Borg Memorial Scholarship), and Sharon Lo and Danaë Metaxa-Kakavouli were 2015 recipients. Other students winning Google scholarships over the past two years include Daniel Milstein, Eli White, and Luis Aguirre.
When John Savage came to Brown a half-century ago, computing was thought of as a service, not a discipline, and the idea of a Department of Computer Science at Brown was highly controversial. Few could have predicted the infrastructure necessary today, or the challenges we face in the areas of cryptography, cybereconomics, big data, and many others.
One of the founders of Brown CS, John's interests have changed as our field has changed, leading him to contribute to such areas as computational complexity, scientific computation, computational nanotechnology, and cybersecurity policy and technology. In place of our annual reunion, we hope you’re planning to join us in Room 130 of 85 Waterman Street from 2-6 PM on Friday, May 26, for a celebration of how John Savage and Brown CS evolved together, including research talks as well as personal reminiscences.  A reception will follow at 115 Waterman Street on the third floor of the CIT.
In preparation for all the fun, let’s take a moment to go back in time and take a look at 50 years of co-evolution.
Starting Out
“I’ve had an interesting career,” says John Savage. He’s sitting in his office on the fifth floor of the CIT, looking out onto rooftops in January sunlight. “I don’t enjoy talking about myself, but I like discussing my work. I hope it provides motivation for others to reach out, to experiment.”
The impetus of that career, which has ranged as widely as any in the field, began in Lynn, Massachusetts, where John was the oldest of six children, growing up in a French-Canadian neighborhood and attending schools where some of the instruction was in French. (He still speaks the language.) “Somehow,” he says mysteriously, he acquired a BB gun in his preteen years. “But I was told it was dangerous and urged to get rid of it.”
John set aside his hopes of becoming a sharpshooter, abandoning the gun in favor of a crystal radio. “I was absolutely fascinated by it,” he says. In his teens, studying at the now-defunct Saint Jean Baptiste High School, a French-Canadian parochial school, he became a ham radio operator, upgrading to a 400 MHz receiver/transmitter and working on his Morse code skills until he could transmit 17 words per minute. Like many other enthusiasts, he enjoyed communicating with peers around the world. “But unlike them,” John says, “I was more interested in the technology.”
Inspired to pursue electrical engineering in college, John knew that he needed physics, so he took a night class at the public high school. He soon discovered that the physics teacher, an out-of-his-element basketball coach, was confused by course material about levers that he was supposed to be explaining to students. He sent out his college applications, and the acceptances started coming in: Tufts, then Northeastern. But at MIT, his first choice, John was waitlisted. This meant a visit to the Dean of Admissions, the intimidatingly-named B. Alden Thresher. “He sat at this massive desk in the middle of a big room,” John remembers. “His secretary pulled my folder, and then he looked at my letters of recommendation. ‘Nothing special!’ he said.”
Antone (“Tony”) Medeiros, Professor Emeritus of Medicine at Brown, met John in 1976, and they biked around the East Side every morning together for years. He adds an interesting detail to the story: “When the dean told John that ham radio enthusiasts didn’t often do well at MIT, John had an answer, which was that he was less interested in radio techniques and more interested in the ideas behind the technology. That says something.”
MIT Years
Whatever the reason, Thresher relented. It was an early success with something that John was to do again and again in his future career, making a case for something against difficult odds and delivering a convincing argument. MIT was a financial challenge as much as an intellectual one: John commuted from home, paying tuition first with a $400 scholarship from his church and earnings from a paper route, then working in the refectory, then with a $100 loan from his father, a self-made man whose parents had died young. Eventually, a Massachusetts Bay Scholarship eliminated the need for John to work, which was fortunate. “Going in,” he says, “I’d only had a half-course of trigonometry, and some of my classmates had taken calculus. At the end of the first semester, my grades were exactly the mean for my class!”
As an undergraduate John joined the Cooperative Program at MIT and spent semesters with 25,000 engineers at Bell Labs, working at locations in New Jersey and Massachusetts. Before each assignment he requested that he be allowed to work with antennas, a subject that fascinated him. He was taken to Holmdel and told that they needed to calibrate a massive antenna by pointing it at radio stars, a job known as “bore sighting”. Deciding that this was not the kind of antenna work he envisioned doing, he took an assignment in signal processing. However, the people who did work with the Holmdel Horn Antenna noticed an inexplicable hissing sound. When it was investigated it provided evidence for the Big Bang and led to the Nobel Prize in Physics for Arno Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson for the discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation. John had narrowly missed a big opportunity.
John earned his ScB from MIT in 1961, then stayed on to earn his ScM a year later and a PhD in 1965. A return to Bell Labs followed, where one of the projects he worked on was a digital data scrambler that altered scrambled a bitstream so that it would be unintelligible without the appropriate descrambler. He also met his wife, the descendant of multiple Brown alums, in Cambridge (John had borrowed a friend’s ID to obtain access to a Harvard event). Her father played a key role in John’s choice of both career and home.
“I thought I’d get an industry job, but my father-in-law recommended Brown. Providence was very different then: there wasn’t any Interstate 95, and we wondered where we’d live. I thought we’d be here about three years,” John laughs.
A Combined Approach
John’s industry experience proved to be extremely useful for future academic work. His PhD thesis had been on sequential decoding, and at Bell Labs, he noticed the huge disparity between the size of encoders and decoders. It was the beginning of a long-term interest in how the idea of complexity was relevant to computing in general, which John pursued across multiple research projects, including a 1972 paper (“Computational Work and Time on Finite Machines”) for the Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery.
Barrett Hazeltine, Professor of Engineering Emeritus and Adjunct Professor of Engineering, has known John from his earliest days at Brown. “It’s hard to explain this now that everyone understands the value of computer science,” he notes, “but we deal with gigabits now, and John was a real pioneer of complexity and minimization in the days when you had to build every gate by hand. There really wasn’t anyone else doing CS with his combined approach of engineering, math, and theory.”
In the years to follow, Savage’s interests grew to encompass applied theory of computation, which includes space-time tradeoffs in serial computation and area-time tradeoffs in the very large scale integrated (VLSI) model of computation, as well as silicon compilers (John notes that colleague Steve Reiss wrote code for one of the earliest of these) and the parallel algorithms used with them.
“Computational complexity is still interesting to me,” John says. “One of my early computer science results was reminiscent of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. I demonstrated that the product of storage space and computation time on a random access machine could not both be made arbitrarily small simultaneously. The circuit complexity of the problem being computed puts a lower limit on the product.”
A New Framework
John’s imagined three years at Brown became six, and when his first sabbatical arrived, he brought his wife and two small children to the Netherlands. While there, an important long-distance conversation with colleagues Andy van Dam and Peter Wegner was starting. A movement had slowly begun: universities nationwide were establishing Departments of Computer Science, primarily for graduate studies.
At the time, some faculty members of Brown’s Divisions of Applied Math and Engineering considered themselves computer scientists and were teaching what were effectively CS courses. Capitalizing on those early efforts, Savage, van Dam, and Wegner wanted to create a new framework for the study of CS at Brown. An initial attempt to obtain permission for a Department of Computer Science failed, but with the aid of Maurice Glicksman (first Dean of the Graduate School and later Provost), the three created a cross-Division Program in Computer Science in 1975.
“After we proved through being a Program that we were a survivable entity,” Andy remembers, “we asked again about becoming a Department, and that's when the antibodies came flooding out. There was fear and even anger that we were proposing to remove valued parts of both Applied Math and Engineering, and Maurice had to make assurances that new positions would be made available to the Divisions. Throughout the whole effort, John and I had complementary views that CS was worthy of becoming a unit of some kind, and we each represented part of the entire discipline. He and I worked together to advance the ball, so I know how much effort he put into it. He was definitely skilled at building the argumentation and delivering it effectively.”
Four years after the Program was established, John assembled a committee that included such luminaries as Dick Karp (University of California, Berkeley), Peter Elias (MIT), Juris Hartmanis (Cornell), and Alan Newell (Carnegie Mellon), and the trio’s years of effort finally paid off with the creation of the Department of Computer Science in 1979. “John saw beyond that era’s conceptions of what computer science was,” says Tony Medeiros. “And then he ran with it!” But even the inaugural symposium, which John organized, wasn’t without its challenges: a student, perhaps overawed by the honor of carrying slides for the world-renowned Donald Knuth, who gave the keynote address, promptly spilled the entire carousel on the floor.
“Our department has worked together so well for decades,” John says, “and to some degree, I take it as a measure of success of our launch. We established practices that are still followed today, and we balanced theory and practice at a time when our competitors were only doing one or the other. One of the first things that our new faculty members say is that our faculty gets along. By no means is that true everywhere!”
In The Chair
The 1980s were a time of rapid growth for Brown CS. Early in the decade, grants from the National Science Foundation and Exxon funded the first electronic workstation classroom and the first large group of networked Apollo workstations anywhere. John followed Andy as Department Chair, and by his second year in the role, new workstations were needed. John led the effort of creating a request for proposal to all vendors, which were eventually narrowed down to Sun, DEC, and NeXT. The goal was what was called a “3M” machine: one million bytes of memory, cycles per second, and pixels on a screen. A highly contentious “bake-off” (Steve Jobs of NeXT was in his argumentative prime) followed, with Tom Doeppner making the case for Sun, Steve Reiss for DEC, and Andy van Dam for NeXT. Sun was the winner, resulting in a multi-decade relationship.
“There was always a lot of back and forth when I was Chair,” John remembers. “Between students and faculty, among faculty members, with the administration. I started weekly faculty meetings over lunch to help us solve problems collaboratively, and they continue today.”
Andy notes, “As Chair, John maintained his strong interest in growing the department. He stayed the course, which for that particular time period was much more challenging than it sounds, given that we were still a very small department trying to compete for faculty, students, and research grants with much better-known and much larger CS departments. Absolutely, he was a great Chair, always active, always helping to build in a variety of ways.”
Another of John’s major contributions was the Industry Partners Program (IPP), which he founded in 1989 in conjunction with Brown’s Development Office and Roy Bonner of IBM. The program creates closer connections between Brown CS and industry, and member companies are encouraged to recruit students, participate in the selection of topics for IPP symposia, and advise on the employment and research needs of corporations. Income from the program has proved crucial to the department’s growth, supporting everything from equipment to faculty searches to distinguished lectures.
The most visible reminder of John’s days as Department Chair is the Thomas J. Watson, Senior Center for Information Technology (the CIT). Andy explains that the building was finished on John’s watch, and he oversaw its execution: “You could count on John. If he said he’d do something, he got it done, on time, and with high quality.” Professor Stan Zdonik adds that John’s work as Department Chair was one of his biggest contributions to Brown CS. “He took the job extremely seriously and did great things,” says Stan. “He was part of a small group of people who deserve huge credit for basically getting the CIT built. That took an incredible amount of work with the university, getting people to agree.”
An Awful Lot To Learn
As the 1980s turned into the 1990s, John’s research interests turned toward scientific computing, working with a student named Jose Castellanos who later joined the IBM Blue Gene team. In addition to their work on implementing a finite element method in distributed computing and mesh adaptation to 2-space and 3-space tetrahedral to simulate the Navier-Stokes equations used to model fluid moving around obstacles, again with an eye toward distributed processing.
It was more evidence for the polymathy that’s been a hallmark of his career. “When I met John in 1976,” says Tony Medeiros, “personal computing was in its early days, and I was a bit of a techie, which meant stepping outside my field, but I was nothing compared to John, who was full of wonderful ideas in my area of interest, microbial antibiotic resistance, and everything else. You couldn’t bring up a topic that he wasn’t intrigued about.”
“Ideas excite me,” John says when asked to explain his wide-ranging interests, telling the story of how he took charge of his college education after being poorly prepared in high school, and was motivated to delve into computational nanotechnology by reading through a rising stack of nanotechnology papers on his desk, plunging in even when he didn’t fully understand them. “I can’t really help being curious about things, and I have other interests that I haven’t fully explored, like cryptography. There’s still an awful lot to learn.”
John’s work with nanotechnology began in 2001, with a one-year starter grant. That led to a large four-year NSF grant that he shared with Charles Lieber of Harvard and André DeHon of Caltech. He says, “When I discovered nanotechnology, I thought it would have the impact that the VLSI revolution did in the 1970s. It hasn’t turned out that way yet, but it might eventually.” Meanwhile, he was learning by attacking the problem in several different directions: giving lots of talks and developing an introductory course on nanotechnology that included quantum computing, nanowire-based technology, and synthetic computing. His research continued until 2011, and he earned his last patent in the area in 2016. Most recently, John’s interest in applied theory of computation has led to publications on input/output complexity for multi-core chips with shared memory.
According to Barrett Hazeltine, the pleasure that John gets out of new and varied research finds synergy with his interpersonal skill: “When you talk to John, you see that he’s enjoying what he’s doing, and he expects people to do the same. ‘Wouldn’t it be fun if’ is how he starts a conversation. Maybe because of his many interests, he gets people to approach their research in another way, and he’s gracious, he makes you think you’re the most important person in the room. He’s a very strong colleague who’s had the courage to change the university for the better in many ways.”
Service Near And Far
Much of this change has occurred through John’s decades of service to Brown, often during times of protest (in response to the effect that the proposed 1975-1976 budget would have on minorities, students occupied University Hall) and strained relations between the faculty and administration. Savage has been Chair, Vice Chair, and Past Chair of the Faculty, Chair of the Task Force on Faculty Governance, Chair of the Nominations Committee, Chair of the Search Committee for Vice President for Public Affairs and University Relations, President of the Faculty Club Board of Managers, and a chair or member of numerous other committees. Among many other achievements, he formed the Academic Priorities Committee, made significant changes to policies concerning budgets and tenure, and created a massive Handbook for the Task Force on Faculty Governance. In recognition of all these efforts, John received the President’s Award for Excellence in Faculty Governance in 2009.
“A lot of people see service as a chore,” Barrett adds, “but John is both a leader and a doer. He answered the question of how faculty can usefully contribute to how Brown runs. He’s one of the people responsible for all the benefit we get from being in a community where the best ideas can come forth and be made known.”
And although it might not be service in the traditional sense, Tony Medeiros points out the Savage family’s incredible allegiance to Brown: “I don’t know if anyone else has said it, so I want to mention that John may have set some kind of a record: all four of his children went to Brown and married Brown alums. He’s a great father and family man, a wonderful friend.”
John’s service has also taken him far beyond the Van Wickle Gates. His contributions to professional societies have been many, including being chosen as a member of the NSF Review Panel on Emerging Technologies and the Program Committee for the IEEE/ACM International Symposium On Nanoscale Architectures. But it’s John’s work in cybersecurity and Internet governance that’s had a truly international scale: he’s served as a Jefferson Science Fellow for the US Department of State, a panelist for the Global Futures Forum in Singapore, an honored guest of the government of Vietnam, and a member of the Scientific and Technical Intelligence Committee.
Judith Strotz, Director of the Office of Cyber Affairs at the US Department of State, worked extensively with John when he was asked to help policymakers in her newly-formed Office better understand science and follow rapidly-emerging trends. “To me,” she says, “the main thing is that he trained us all. It doesn’t sound momentous, but it really is. It’s really hard for non-scientists to address all these issues, and we made huge strides thanks to his knowledge, persistence, and patience. He’s a true expert and a great colleague who helped us sort through problems and find a way forward. I miss working with him.”
John is also a Professorial Fellow for the EastWest Institute, a non-profit organization with the goal of reducing conflict worldwide. Bruce McConnell is the organization’s Global Vice-President, and one of Savage’s frequent collaborators, including a recent paper on Internet governance. He says, “John’s influence and impact are immeasurable…He’s hardworking, and when he says he’ll do something, he gets it done. But then he goes beyond that by bringing his enthusiasm, curiosity, and creativity. He always opens up options.”
“It’s been great fun,” John says of his time in Washington, remembering days when he had the maximum level of security clearance, unable to bring any technology into his office and required to store his top-secret disk in a safe every night. Always the educator, he makes an interesting point about autodidacticism: “90 to 95 percent of the information used in intelligence analysis is open source. A deep understanding of a region or country is something that can be taught, and avid readers who devote themselves to an area can teach themselves.”
Great Teaching
When asked about John’s contributions, Judith Strotz begins with his instructional skill, saying, “John is really humble. He taught our team of policy makers in simple terms at first, but without ever being condescending. He showed respect and understanding of where everyone was at in order to help them learn. To me, that’s great teaching.”
Over the years, John has taught more than 15 courses at Brown, covering topics from computational complexity to cybersecurity. This spring, he’s teaching CSCI 1800 Cybersecurity and International Relations for the seventh time, bringing the subject material to life with a series of world-class speakers, including an expert in cyber economics and the National Intelligence Officer for Cyber Issues.
He’s also fielded multiple winning teams of students at the CYFY, CyberSeed, and Cyber 9/12 competitions. “Teaching is how I get firsthand experience,” he says, citing a class (CSCI 1951-E Computer Systems Security: Principles and Practice) that functions as an enriched version of a course developed by Professor Roberto Tamassia. “The best way to fill gaps in my knowledge is to study something, then teach it.”
Co-Evolution
The theme of co-evolution was John’s carefully-considered choice for the upcoming celebration in May. It reflects not just his multifaceted career and the growth of our department but the evolving face of computer science and the continuing challenge of developing the technology needed for a changing world.
“Start by thinking about how difficult it is to build an operating system,” John says. “Very roughly, you’re looking at 80 million lines of code that have to be designed, written, tested, documented. If someone can write 20 lines of code per day, at 250 working days per year, you’re looking at 16,000 person-years of work. It’s an enormous effort.”
At the same time as John and his colleagues were crafting policy and procedure for an evolving Brown CS, they were creating an equivalent framework for computer science itself: “Over the years, we’ve had to build the entire infrastructure to support our own discipline: we had to invent computer graphics so we could have graphical user interfaces, we had to create operating systems that scheduled jobs correctly, we had to define protocols for sending packets so the Internet can work. If this had been commonly understood in the 1970s, we would’ve been given a department the first time we asked!”
And yet there’s no sign of cynicism in the remark. Bruce McConnell sees John’s positivity as an unmistakable part of his secret to success: “He always sees another angle and brings in ideas from other domains. It’s intellect plus optimism. For John, the glass is always more than half full!”
The next set of challenges, John explains, demands rigor. As scientists, responsibility has been placed directly in front of us. “Most people can learn to write software for simple tasks,” he says, “but the difficult problems need scientists. There are new challenges in artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, nanotechnology, data science. There are very specific problems, like the role of social media in promoting fake news or the ethical questions of self-driving cars, which demonstrate that we’re in an era where the technology we invented has unintended consequences. Computer science has become a critically important field. These are technical challenges that demand expertise and will play out on a social, economic, and geopolitical scale. We need to play a central role.”
That role is also an interdisciplinary and intersectional one: “Computer science will become important to more and more people. I’d love to see more women in the field and more historically underrepresented groups: we need different perspectives because of the impact that we’re having on international relations, engineering, and other areas. I want to see people be tolerant and generous with each other -- we’re all human beings. A hundred thousand years of thought have gone into our survival, and we need to cooperate and pass on knowledge. My message to the next generation of students is to stay positive: when you encounter problems, get the best advice, work them out, keep plowing through, and don’t give up.”
John Savage’s track record shows a more than ample willingness to take up that gauntlet with energy and purpose. “He has this quality,” says Andy van Dam, “of positivity and non-superficiality, of digging in, of having a grounded position and willingness to keep pushing at something.”
“Whatever the challenge is,” says Tony Medeiros, “he always has ideas. It’s trivial to say that John is incredibly smart, but his enthusiasm has always taken him everywhere, and it still does.”
Could anything be more valuable to a young startup than expert-led coaching sessions on how to identify opportunities and design business models, or the chance to pitch ideas to industry leaders? Probably not much, but a check for $100,000 might be a close contender.
NYU Stern's W. R. Berkley Innovation Labs $300K Entrepreneurs Challenge, held at New York University's Stern School of Business, offers all those things. Last week, PhD Candidate Thomas Dickerson of Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) returned from the competition with some valuable experience and one of those comically-oversized checks that are almost too big for one person to carry. After months of workshops, coaching sessions, and deliverables, his startup, Geopipe, was selected for its potential for great impact, challenging assumed boundaries, and inspiring a sense of what's possible. It won the top prize of $100,000 in the Challenge's Technology Venture Competition.
Co-founded last year with Dr. Christopher Mitchell, a New York University alum, Geopipe builds algorithms to turn 2D and 3D data into highly detailed 3D virtual models. Their system ingests and analyzes data, including satellite photos, maps, laser scans, and much more. It then combines machine learning with a distributed systems approach to rapidly correlate data sources, understand structure, and produce complete 3D models at many different scales. One of Geopipe's strengths is that it offers more semantic modeling than competing solutions with massive amounts of content while coupling models to real-world data without a great deal of manual effort. It puts models in the hands of customers, who can use them in their own software suites with automatic customization options at a consistently high level of visual quality.
"This is an extremely important moment for Geopipe," says Thomas, "and we'll put the money to good use. We have a pretty extensive R&D road-map for the next 12 months, and we're looking to balance pushing that with getting hands-on feedback through pilot programs with customers in the architecture market."

Collège de France has invited An Wang Professor of Computer Science, Emeritus Franco Preparata of Brown University to be the keynote speaker at the forthcoming colloquium "Computational Geometry and Topology in the Sciences". The event will be held in Paris on June 6, 2017, and Franco will address the topic of "Computational Geometry: the Early Days" in his remarks.
From a 16th-century automaton and a metal swan that wowed Mark Twain to present day wonders that care for the elderly and help autistic children develop empathy, a new exhibit ("Robots") at London's Science Museum is one of the most comprehensive of its kind ever assembled. The Humans to Robots Laboratory, led by Professor Stefanie Tellex of Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS), contributed a demonstration of their Baxter robot, which they've used to do pioneering work in robotic grasping, robot-to-robot communication, and human-robot interaction. The exhibit will run until September 3, and it's already received extensive coverage from the Telegraph, the Guardian, the New Scientist, and Nature.
Last semester, for the first time, Computer Science became the most commonly-chosen major at Brown University. The total number of students majoring in CS was 321, exceeding the second most popular major by more than a sixth. This semester, the margin is even greater: 440 students are majoring in CS, a quarter more than the next-highest selection. As another way to look at these numbers, more than one sixth of Brown students with declared majors picked computer science.
What is computational thinking, and how should it be taught? Almost three decades after the term was coined, the answer is still being worked out. How do we help students reframe research to formulate questions to a data set instead of a human? How do we teach broad use of computation to students who won't become computer scientists?
Last month, the New York Times explored these questions with a selection of students, academics, and even developers of children's media. They took particular interest in a course (CSCI 0030 Introduction to Computation for the Humanities and Social Sciences) that was created ten years ago at Brown by Professors Tom Doeppner, John Hughes, Shriram Krishnamurthi, and Steve Reiss to help students learn this "new mode of thinking". Featured in the article and interviewed in depth, Shriram and Stephen Brawner, a PhD candidate currently teaching the course, share their experience with the challenges of helping students learn not just to program but to use programming to solve problems.

In the era of big data, there’s plenty of software on the market that helps people to explore and visualize datasets in search of patterns and new discoveries. But how can users tell if the patterns they’re seeing are real or if they simply appear in the data by random chance?
The answer is that they can’t — not unless they apply appropriate statistical tests to make sure their findings are valid, a feature that currently available commercial data exploration tools do not provide. But with a new $3.1 million grant from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Brown University computer scientists are aiming to develop a software package that brings new statistical rigor to interactive data exploration.
“The goal is to build a user-friendly system than can easily explore data and produce useful visualizations, but also continuously controls for the statistical validity of the results,” said Eli Upfal, professor of computer science at Brown and the project’s principal investigator. 
The grant brings together a team of Brown professors, postdocs and students to tackle different aspects of the project. Tim Kraska, an assistant professor, and Carsten Binnig, adjunct associate professor, are machine learning and database experts who will work mainly on the data management side of the project. Computer graphics pioneer Andy van Dam will work on the user interface and visualizations. Upfal, an expert in computational theory, will work mainly on the statistical side of the project.
Statistical Safeguards
Statisticians and scientists routinely use a suite of tests to measure whether or not a result is statistically significant. But the statistical issues in the big data world go well beyond basic significance tests. Modern data exploration tools make it easy to poke and prod a dataset in myriad ways with a few mouse clicks. That can create an issue known to statisticians as the “multiple comparisons problem,” and it’s one of the things Upfal and his colleagues hope to address. 
The problem is essentially this: The more questions you ask of a dataset, the more likely you are to stumble upon something that looks like a genuine correlation, but is actually just a random fluctuation in the data. Without proper statistical correction, it can lead to false discoveries.
“To some extent it’s our fault here in computer science that we have made analysis of data so easy,” Upfal said. “If I give you a huge database and let you simply push a button to ask question after question, you’re eventually reach something that’s there purely by chance.”
There are statistical techniques for dealing with the problem, but none of them are easily implemented in a real-time data exploration setting. So Upfal and his colleagues will need to develop an appropriate technique on their own.
“We’ll be building some new theory about how to evaluate a sequence of data queries,” Upfal said. “And we’ll need it to be computationally efficient. Our system is interactive, so we need everything to compute right away.”
Better Data Science
The researchers envision a system that continually monitors the questions people ask in the process of exploring data and warns them when they’re on shaky statistical ground. By doing so, the system will help users — especially those without statistics training — to avoid making false discoveries.
And as the use of data exploration expands into new domains, statistical safeguards like these become ever more important. Companies like Netflix and Google for years have combed huge datasets looking for correlations that help them suggest movies or target advertising. In those settings, false correlations lead to a few bad recommendations or mis-targeted ads.
“That’s not such a big deal,” Upfal said. “But when we’re applying these techniques to medicine, for example, we need to be a bit more careful.”
The project will be part of Brown’s recently launched Data Science Initiative, which is broadly aimed at developing these kinds of novel approaches to dealing with data.  
“Ultimately we want to promote data science and see it be successful,” Upfal said. “We hope this project will be a step toward that.”
Three things that we take for granted when collaborating with other humans, perceiving, acting, and communicating, are some of the areas that are most difficult for today's robots. Assistant Professor Stefanie Tellex of Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) has decided to tackle them all at once, and she's just won a National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER Award to support her research.
CAREER Awards are given in support of outstanding junior faculty teacher-scholars who excel at research, education, and integration of the two within the context of an organizational mission, and Stefanie joins multiple previous Brown CS winners of the award, including (most recently) Jeff Huang, Rodrigo Fonseca, and Tim Kraska. 
"We're unifying perception, action, and communication," Stefanie says, "by using object-oriented multimodal decision-theoretic models, and the goal is to create robots that collaborate with us to meet our needs. This project enables a robot to acquire models for detecting, localizing, and manipulating physical objects, plan in very large spaces to find appropriate actions involving those objects, and communicate with people to learn how to use objects to meet their needs. We have to have this integrated model for a collaborative robot assistant because it needs to be able to robustly interpret natural language instructions, actively collect new information to complete its tasks, and ask for help when things go wrong." 
Stefanie's research will take place in two settings: assisting the disabled and elderly through object delivery in the home, and collaborative assembly in a factory. Along the way, the project aims to set a record by creating the largest-ever dataset of object instances by distributing data collection across everyone with a Baxter robot. Data collection will be carried out by high school students in an internship program that's been made possible in part by the Northeast Robotics Colloquium (NERC), which Stefanie co-founded, introducing hundreds of students from diverse backgrounds to the larger academic and industrial robotics community in the northeast.
Only a few months after the founding of Brown University's Data Science Initiative (DSI), the Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) is eager to share three innovative projects that represent the recent fruits of long-standing efforts to advance the state of the art in data science research:
Upfal, Binnig, Kraska, And Van Dam Win A $3.1M DARPA Grant For Quality-Aware Interactive Curation Of Models
Professor Eli Upfal (PI) and Professors Carsten Binnig, Tim Kraska, and Andy van Dam (co-PIs) have just won a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) grant of more than 3.1 million dollars, and domain experts of all kinds stand to benefit.
In the past, researchers have attempted to make large scale data analysis more accessible, but existing machine learning (ML) tools are still far from allowing non-technical users to explore data interactively. They require a deep technical understanding and do not address the risk factors in iterative model development. Upfal and his collaborators have responded by developing the first system for Quality-aware Interactive Curation of Models (QuIC-M). The new project will enable domain experts to build models themselves without the need to involve a data scientist, and to do so in a risk-aware manner, with the software continuously monitoring the user’s interactions to automatically warn them about potential false discoveries, and if possible, suggest solutions or even automatically correct common mistakes.
Beginning with a selection of algorithms from a model family and hyper-parameter tuning techniques implemented in MLBase, the researchers have integrated these techniques into their interactive human-in-the-loop data exploration and model building suite, Vizdom/IDEA. Vizdom is a novel pen-and-touch interface that allows domain experts to curate ML workflows in an intuitive, fluid way, while IDEA is the back-end for Vizdom that enables the interactive curation and evaluation of models on large data sets.
The result will be interactive and quality-assured data exploration that continuously monitors users and warns them about potential wrong conclusions or models. Upfal and his colleagues expect that domain experts who take an introductory class in statistics and ML but are not data scientists will be able to use QuIC-M to build models an order of magnitude faster than an ML expert, with quality that's only slightly (and acceptably) inferior to the expert solution.
Tim Kraska Wins A Sloan Award For Democratizing Data Exploration And Analysis
Picture yourself in a meeting, looking up at a conference room wall. Not far in the future, Professor Tim Kraska expects it to be equipped with an interactive whiteboard that will enable a broad range of users to work together in a single meeting to visualize, transform, and analyze complex data in real time. Between our present and this future is a complete rethinking of the full analytics stack, from its user interface to its smallest components, and incorporating pertinent algorithms.
Tim has just been named an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellow in one of the oldest and most competitive fellowship programs in the country. He's the eighth Brown CS faculty member to receive the honor, which Brown CS has now received for four years in a row. The fellowships, which take the form of a $50,000 grant used over a two-year period, honor and promote the science of outstanding researchers early in their academic careers who show outstanding promise for fundamental contributions to new knowledge.
Tim's work that will be funded by the fellowship aims to democratize data science by enabling a broader range of users to unfold the potential of their data through the development of a new generation of algorithms and systems for interactive and sustainable data-driven discovery. It includes three major components: Tupleware (a parallel high-performance UDF processing system designed for “normal” users, not the world's Googles and Microsofts), Vizdom, and new techniques to control the multi-hypothesis error.
At SIGMOD, Zhao, De Stefani, Zgraggen, Binnig, Upfal, And Kraska Will Present On Controlling False Discoveries In Interactive Data Exploration
Have you ever been skeptical of recent news items claiming that the secret to winning a Nobel Prize is eating more chocolate and that drinking a glass of wine is as good as spending an hour at the gym? Data-driven stories like these are prone to inaccuracy due to false inferences, and with the rise of interactive data exploration tools, the likelihood of error is significantly increased.
But after analyzing the think-aloud protocols of various user studies with more than 50 participants, researchers at Brown CS have an answer. At SIGMOD '17, a leading international forum for database researchers, PhD candidates Zheguang Zhao, Lorenzo De Stefani, and Emanuel Zgraggen, and Professors Carsten Binnig, Eli Upfal, and Tim Kraska will present the first end-to-end system, QUDE (Quantifying Uncertainty in Data Exploration), to automatically control the risk of false discovery for visual, interactive data exploration.
Their work offers a user interface and an initial set of meaningful default hypotheses to control the ratio of false discoveries without interrupting the exploration process, provides a superior and more modern criterion of controlling the false discovery rate, and demonstrates how the system controls false discovery for experts and novice users alike using generated and real-world data.
Looking Forward
"Data science has been a Brown CS strength for a long time," says Department Chair Ugur Cetintemel, "and the latest work of my colleagues in this area is rigorous, transformative, and will be extremely far-reaching because it addresses real pain points and pitfalls commonly experienced by data scientists. We're excited about the real impact ahead and all the collaborations this line of work will enable across the methods and applications of data science."
Jeff Brock, Director of the DSI, is also eager: “The DSI is extremely fortunate to count among its senior leadership and founding architects these path-breaking researchers in computer science and data science. These breakthrough research projects, each funded through an extremely competitive process, represent the driving philosophy for the DSI: that data and its tools should be accessible to the domain specialist,  distributable in an equitable and transparent manner, and interactive, in a way that maintains the virtuous cycle from model, to inference, to refinement at the hands of the human expert. The DSI is proud to support their work and count these innovative efforts among its first guiding projects."
At the USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI) this week in Boston, Massachusetts, Professor Rodrigo Fonseca of Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) and collaborators from University of California San Diego and University of California Berkeley accepted an award for the most influential paper among those presented a decade ago at the annual conference. Rodrigo and co-author George Porter accepted the 2017 NSDI Test of Time Award for their paper (“X-Trace: A Pervasive Network Tracing Framework”) along with their co-author and former advisor, Professor Ion Stoica, at a luncheon on March 26 to honor a paper published at NSDI 2007. George is now a professor at the University of Calfornia San Diego, where he is a co-director of the university's Center for Networked Systems (CNS).
Rodrigo and George were at University of California Berkeley when they wrote the original paper, which was also co-authored with Professors Randy H. Katz and Scott Shenker of the same institution. “We wrote X-Trace while we were PhD students,” recalls George. “It was really an honor to work with my colleagues on this project, which formed the basis of Rodrigo’s and my PhD dissertations.”
Modern Internet systems often combine different applications, span different administrative domains, and function in the context of network mechanisms (tunnels, VPNs, overlays, and so on). In their 2007 paper, Rodrigo and his collaborators argued that “diagnosing these complex systems is a daunting challenge”. He says, “Many diagnostic tools existed at the time, but none existed for reconstructing a comprehensive view of service behavior.”
X-Trace was not the first tracing framework, but it was influential given that it was effectively the first framework for end-to-end tracing to focus on generality and pervasiveness. “It was based on the observation that an increasing number of systems would be built from heterogeneous components, built and operated by different people,” Rodrigo explains. “In contrast, existing tracing frameworks required a specific language, or were targeted to a particular system.”
The researchers implemented X-Trace in protocols and software systems, and in their prize-winning paper, they set out to explain three different use scenarios: domain name system (DNS) resolution; a three-tiered photo-hosting website; and a service accessed through an overlay network.
The image at left represents an HTTP request going through CoralCDN, a distributed content distribution network. The request is tried in parallel in four different web caches (the different colored paths) before succeeding at the last one.
Hari Balakrishnan, who co-chaired NSDI in 2007, broke the news of the Test of Time Award to the recipients. “We’re very pleased to share that your X-Trace paper from NSDI 2007 has been selected for an NSDI Test of Time Award,” he wrote. “The award honors a paper published ten years earlier at NSDI with retrospectively the most impact on research or practice.”
The X-Trace paper has proved to be prescient in both research and practice. “Today, many Internet-scale backend systems are built using a ‘microservices’ approach, with hundreds of loosely connected components tied together to offer larger services,” noted George. “Debugging these systems effectively requires what X-Trace provided: the ability to correlate events in one component to events in other arbitrary components, even if they were many steps far removed from the first.”
The rapid adoption of tracing began with Google’s introduction of Dapper in 2010, which offered a similar primitive to X-Trace. Twitter’s Zipkin and Cloudera’s HTrace were open-source implementations of Dapper. Another current competitor in the market, called Traceview, also has X-Trace in its DNA after a series of startups and acquisitions dating back to 2010.
“By 2015, many companies such as Netflix, Baidu, Uber, Facebook, and Etsy were deploying internal trace solutions very similar to our ideas presented in the X-Trace paper,” observes Rodrigo. “And the interest persists in a rather recent initiative called OpenTracing, which is trying to standardize end-to-end tracing.” In 2017, the excitement surrounding tracing continues unabated. For example, earlier this year, Amazon released X-Ray, which offers distributed tracing for Amazon Web Services, and another company, Datadog, also released a new end-to-end tracing product.
The NSDI award is not his first for his work on tracing: he co-authored a paper on "pivot tracing" that received a Best Paper award at the 2015 Symposium on Operating Systems Principles. That same year, Rodrigo won an NSF CAREER Award for his work on "causal tracing" to elucidate understanding of the performance of distributed systems. (Causal tracing covers a wide variety of tracing systems and frameworks, including X-Trace itself, as well as Dapper, Zipkin, HTrace, and many others.)
“It’s becoming increasingly difficult to understand how a system behaves, and, especially, how and why it fails,” he says. “Causal tracing is a technique that captures the causality of events across all components, layers, and machines, and it eases the task of understanding complex distributed systems.”
Besides his work on tracing, Rodrigo is more broadly interested in distributed systems and computer networking: "Ultimately, I'm always trying to design systems that are more useful, efficient, and understandable to developers, operators, and end users."

"Nationwide, the concept of 'CS for all' has become ubiquitous," says Brown CS Professor Shriram Krishnamurthi, co-director of Bootstrap. "But not all students will become computer scientists. We know already that opportunities to use data will be part of their lives ahead. To be successful, they need to seize those opportunities and use data well, and we want to help them do that." Bootstrap is a series of research-based K-12 curricula now used globally, and they've just launched a data science program with the goal of helping students learn to use data effectively.
"We wanted to provide a foundation for data science and statistical thinking," says former Brown CS undergraduate and current Master's student Sam Dooman, who co-taught the program at Providence, Rhode Island's Central High School. "In Bootstrap Data Science, students write programs to ask and answer authentic questions with data.  By exposing students to these concepts in different contexts, we hope to provide more equitable computer science and statistics education."
Like other Bootstrap curricula, the data science program, which uses the Pyret programming language, integrates into existing classes, providing equitable access for school systems in which money isn't available to hire computer science specialists. Co-instructing with teachers Jennifer Geller and Tom Hoffman, Sam worked with a class of Social Studies students. For an inner-city school, the topic was extremely relevant: using Rhode Island Public School data to find correlations between school performance and demographics. 
"The students wrote programs to answer questions that real sociologists ask," Sam says, "and the students were really motivated. Most had never programmed before, and they were all able to complete the course and answer questions about the dataset. There was one moment when a student who had no prior experience with programming helped a friend to debug his code, and we hadn't even taught debugging yet, which was really cool. They started the program afraid that they'd break the computers, and almost immediately overcame that fear. It was incredible to see how fast they got a handle on Pyret, getting error messages at the start and then working through them."
The Bootstrap team is now in editing mode, evaluating the success of Sam's work and perfecting the curriculum, adding more exercises and scaffolding worksheets, and making some improvements to Pyret. This summer, the program will begin again with a workshop in Colorado to prepare another cohort of teachers.
"Data science now drives many aspects of our lives," says Sam. "Whether it's with SQL tables or Excel spreadsheets, working with data is part of almost every profession. Teaching statistics is a very difficult task, and we've seen tremendous societal problems that could have been prevented with a better understanding of data science. We need students to be able to decompose statistical problems, look for structure, apply patterns, and answer questions with confidence."
And the new data science curriculum has been designed with exactly that in mind, providing an entry point with no prerequisites needed. "Our program is extremely accessible," Shriram explains. "It could be any kid's first exposure to computer science and/or statistical methods. For years, Bootstrap has been focused on teaching foundational skills, creating equity, and integrating into existing classrooms, and now we're tackling a longstanding problem of teaching statistics. It's a really comprehensive solution." 
The Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers (KPCB) Engineering Fellows Program is one of technology’s most prestigious fellowships, with only 54 students chosen in 2017 from a pool of 2,000. This year, participation from Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) set a new record for the number of wins in a year: undergraduate students Michael Markell, Noah Picard, and Hannah Tipperman were all selected as fellows.
Despite the program's title, it's open to outstanding students who are studying computer science, engineering, mathematics, physics, or other fields related to software development. Hannah and Michael are CS concentrators; Noah concentrates in both CS and mathematics. They'll join other students from across the country in Silicon Valley for a work experience (participating companies span the industry and the alphabet from Airbnb to Zumper) that will be supplemented with events and programming led by CEOs and executives from KPCB portfolio companies and KPCB Partners.
The Randy F. Pausch '82 Computer Science Undergraduate Summer Research Award, given this year to Sorawee Porncharoenwase, recognizes strong achievement from young students and offers them the opportunity to partner with faculty and advance work that began in the Brown CS undergraduate research program.
"My research project with [Postdoctoral Research Associate] Tim Nelson," Sorawee explains, "is about using logic to aid users in verifying correctness of a system. I was introduced to software verification and programming languages at Brown, and I've been interested in them ever since. After taking Logic for Systems with Tim in my first year, I continued my interest by TAing the course last year and this year." 
This summer, he'll be working on program synthesis combined with past work that Tim, Professor Shriram Krishnamurthi, and their PhD student, Natasha Danas, have done on presenting the output of formal methods tools. Sorawee says, "I'm very excited for this summer. The project is an opportunity to work with Tim again. Moreover, now we'll be developing a tool for other people to use! I'm very grateful for the award, and I'd also like to thank Tim and Shriram for all of their support."
Tool-building is exactly what Peter Norvig is looking for. He sees this award as a "multiplier" that will amplify the value of his gift and extend it through time. "In the past," he says, "we had to build all our own tools, and we didn't have time to combine computer science with other fields. Now, there are so many opportunities to do so. I think it's a wise choice: you invest in things that you think will do good, and educating a student allows them to help add to the things that you're already trying to accomplish." 
"There's been great success at democratizing the creation of complex visualization with tools like D3, Vega, ggplot, and Tableau," says PhD candidate Connor Gramazio of Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS). "But at the same time, just because we can create something doesn't necessarily mean that we should – and right now, those types of design judgements still require a lot of expertise that many visualization creators don't necessarily have. And even if people do have the design expertise, regularly figuring out usable design can take prohibitively long."
Luckily, he's offering a solution: three open-source projects that aim to reduce barriers for effective visualiztion design. Connor will be presenting them on April 25 as part of an invited talk at OpenVis Conf, a two-day, single-track conference centered around the practice of visualizing data on the web.
Connor says, "This is a huge area of research, and we've only just scraped the surface, but I've tried to make a dent in color design. The problem is that visualization design is fairly specialized in that it typically requires a contextual balance of discriminability and preference in order to be useful. This balance is particularly important for color, and although there are a huge amount of tools out there for making color palettes, the majority don't take it under consideration."
His first project has been used by about 14,000 unique users since its launch in August, and seen considerable activity on GitHub as well:
The other two projects are both D3 modules, Connor's implementations of open-sourced color science publications developed by other researchers:
"Being selected as a speaker at OpenVis Conf was an indescribably huge honor," Connor says. "The two keynotes, and many of the other speakers, were some of the people who originally inspired me to get into visualization research way back in 2010, and it's still a little crazy to think that I'm speaking alongside them at the same venue. It's a really, really fantastic way to capstone my PhD at Brown."
Only five years ago, Professor Shriram Krishnamurthi of Brown University's Computer Science Department (Brown CS) was the inaugural winner of SIGPLAN's Robin Milner Young Researcher Award. But age comes fast. A needle skips on a record somewhere, the hair of the youthful researcher is turned white, and the mantle of Experience is clapped onto Shriram's shoulders.
The Università della Svizzera Italiana, the primary university for the Italian part of Switzerland, will be awarding him an honorary doctorate in May. Shriram is sensitive to the short duration in which he's gone from a Young Researcher to Elder Statesman. Nevertheless, recognizing his transition, Shriram says, "I will do my best to act as crotchety as possible to honor this passage."
Working with colleagues from the University of Texas at El Paso and the University of Kansas, Caroline Klivans (a Senior Lecturer in applied mathematics and computer science at Brown University and Associate Director of the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics) has achieved a rare feat: disproving a conjecture first put forth in 1979.
In mathematics, a simplicial complex is a set composed of points, line segments, triangles, and their n-dimensional counterparts. In 1979, Richard Stanley made the Partitionability Conjecture: that all simplicial complexes that met a certain algebraic condition also met a particular combinatorial condition. Until the counterexample provided by Caroline and colleagues, the conjecture was widely perceived in the community to be true. Questions of how various algebraic, geometric, topological and combinatorial properties interact have now been reopened.
Their research is featured in the Notices of the American Mathematical Society and is available here. 
Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) is happy to announce that pending the anticipated approval of the Corporation of Brown, Caroline Klivans will be promoted to Senior Lecturer, effective July 1, 2017.
A graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Caroline joined Brown in 2011 after teaching and conducting research at The Mathematical Sciences Research Institute, Cornell University and  the University of Chicago. A lecturer in both Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, she is also Associate Director of the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics (ICERM). Caroline's teaching includes topics such as discrete structures, probability, and statistical inference, and her research focuses on algebraic, geometric, and topological combinatorics.
Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) is proud to note that with Assistant Professor Tim Kraska's recent win, our faculty have earned a total of eight Sloan Research Fellowships. This is the fourth year in a row of Brown CS receiving the honor:

Picture yourself in a meeting with colleagues, looking up at a conference room wall. Not far in the future, Assistant Professor Tim Kraska of Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) expects it to be equipped with an interactive whiteboard that will enable domain experts and data scientists to work together in a single meeting to visualize, transform, and analyze complex data in real time. Among many other benefits, the process would remove the need for multiple days of back-and-forth interactions. Between our present and this future is a complete rethinking of the full analytics stack, from its user interface to its smallest components, and incorporating pertinent algorithms. 
Tim has just been named an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellow in one of the oldest and most competitive fellowship programs in the country. He's the eighth faculty member to receive the honor, which Brown CS has now received for four years in a row. The fellowships, which take the form of a $50,000 grant used over a two-year period, honor and promote the science of outstanding researchers early in their academic careers who show outstanding promise for fundamental contributions to new knowledge.
"Very few people," Tim says, "possess a strong domain expertise and a deep understanding of machine learning, data management, visualization, and many other related fields. My research aims to democratize data science by enabling a broader range of users to unfold the potential of their data through the development of a new generation of algorithms and systems for interactive and sustainable data-driven discovery."
Tim's research that the Sloan fellowship will help fund has three major components: 
Lecturer in Engineering and Adjunct Lecturer in Computer Science Ian Gonsher and Assistant Professors Jeff Huang and Stefanie Tellex of Brown University’s Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) have just received Seed Awards from Brown’s Office of the Vice President for Research (OVPR) to help them compete more successfully for large-scale, interdisciplinary, multi-investigator grants. They join numerous previous Brown CS recipients of OVPR Seed Awards, including (most recently) Ugur Cetintemel, Sorin Istrail, Tim Kraska, and Michael Littman.
Ian Gonsher And Stefanie Tellex
One of the interesting aspects of Ian and Stefanie's research is that it sprang from a class project for 1951C Designing Humanity Centered Robots in the fall of 2014. Student input has been ongoing, and they expect it to continue, hopefully inspiring an increasing number of Brown and RISD students to pursue research opportunities. Motivated by some ominous demographic trends (over the next decade, the retiree population is predicted to increase by 33%, while the labor force caring for them is expected to shrink), the researchers propose ubiquitous, minimally invasive, networked robotics as a solution to help older adults age in place.
The stepping stone for the project funded by the OVPR Seed Award is Tablebot, a prototype "situated robot" that's integrated into the built environment and engages the user with movement, telepresence, and artificial intelligence. Building upon this model, the Walkerbot project will create a unique hybrid of telepresence robot and powered walker, designed to be ergonomic but also collect biometric data in real time. This combination will help users not only navigate their environment better but benefit from decreased isolation and loneliness and even allow medical professionals to remotely conduct diagnostics and respond to emergencies.
Jeff Huang
Jeff's research focuses on the problem of poor sleep, which plagues 60 million Americans. His team will conduct a large-scale study running over 10 years, combining computational and clinical techniques into an automated system that makes actionable recommendations, called SleepCoacher. Their solution uses mobile phones, which are placed on the user's bed and monitor whether recommendations are effective, continuously changing them to slowly improve sleep over an extended period of time.
The SleepCoacher project combines several innovations, from using Bayesian statistical analysis to giving probabilistic interpretations of data to letting users conduct small-scale experiments on their own sleep, helping SleepCoacher learn and adjust its recommendations in a rapid feedback cycle. PhD student Nediyana Daskalova, who has had a core role in this project, noted, "With such distinct differences between individuals' sleep patterns, it takes more than just a couple of nights to help someone improve their sleep, so we need a more refined system to study this issue." The prototype app will soon be on both Android and iOS and the recommendation engine is already compatible with Sleep as Android, a commercial app with more than 10 million installs and 1.5 million active users.
Theophilus "Theo" A. Benson is joining Brown CS as Assistant Professor in September, and if you see him out on a run, training for his next Tough Mudder, consider joining him for at least a block or two. He’s always eager to discuss recent IoT security challenges, cloud outages, and performance issues.
Theo’s introduction to CS dates back to the era when cloud computing was only possible in science fiction: “I remember there not being a lot of color and complexity on the computer screen. Back then, it was so much simpler to find out how things worked.” His interest in the field continued through high school, but an early job at a startup, doing testing and development, systems engineering, and release engineering, provided additional momentum and a definite direction for Theo’s career. “One day,” he remembers, “I got paged because the sysadmin was out sick and the server had gone down. I understood the release process, so I thought I’d just reboot and things would be fine. The problem was that some of the process had been documented, but part hadn’t, and a lot had to be inferred. Not quite as easy as I’d thought!”
“And that got me thinking about the broad space of networking,” he says, “and how to take humans out of the loop when they’re going to cause errors or slow things down. The problem is, we don’t want to be taken out of it!”
In graduate school at University of Wisconsin, Theo focused his attention on the intersection of networks and security, using the tool of configuration management, a process that analyzes the requirements, design, and performance of a network to improve the consistency of its performance. “Configuration management is a huge challenge due to competing economic interests,” he says. “There can be a lot of animosity when sysadmins think that we’re taking away their jobs, but we’re really just trying to minimize the time they spend on certain tasks.” He gives the analogy of going to the doctor: patients describe their symptoms but don’t diagnose their own illnesses.
Despite industry experience that also includes AT&T and Microsoft, academia has always felt like home: “There’s a lot more freedom to attack problems. In the corporate world, when a new buzzword arrives, everyone switches over because it’s the next big thing. I like the wide scope of interests at Brown CS. Instead of being in a silo of networking experts, I’m surrounded by different perspectives.”
When we ask Theo about the outreach efforts listed on his web site (among other things, his research group has allowed high school students to collaborate with them during the summer), his answer is refreshingly free of platitudes. “That experience was very valuable to the students,” he says, “but I don’t feel like I’m being helpful enough. As long as we’re interacting with students at their level, it helps, but getting outreach right isn’t easy, and I’m still trying to figure things out. A lot has been given to me, so I feel like I need to do more.”
He’ll have a chance in Providence, where he’s looking forward to being physically closer to both family and colleagues in the area. Part of the Brown CS appeal, he explains, is that he’ll be working alongside experts in software-defined infrastructure, programming languages, and the Internet of Things, not just networking. “We’ll amplify each other,” Theo says. “And I’ve heard great things about the undergrads and how they take a huge amount of initiative in jumping in with research. I want to see what we can do together.”
Some of the research possibilities include the area of software-defined networking, which he sees as going through a major paradigm shift. “There’s going to be a whole new level of automation,” he says. “Instead of transplanting network protocols designed for Google to developing countries, where there are huge infrastructure discrepancies, we’ll have algorithms that can learn about local conditions and adjust, networks that are able to learn by themselves.”
“It requires us,” explains Theo, “to question assumptions about what works and what doesn’t.” It’s part of what appeals to him about the work of Ion Stoica, whom he cites as one of his heroes. “I always looked up to his work with Spark, which really impacted the way big data interact with networks.”  In the end, he says, meaningful computer science speaks for itself far better than becoming a household name. “When you have that much impact, that’s what people remember. They may not know your name, but if it works, it works!”
Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) is happy to announce that Rodrigo Fonseca has been promoted to Associate Professor with tenure, effective July 1, 2017 (pending the anticipated approval of the Corporation of Brown).
Rodrigo joined Brown CS in 2009 after doing postdoctoral work at Yahoo! Research and receiving his PhD from the University of California at Berkeley. His work revolves around distributed systems, networking, and operating systems. Broadly, he's interested in understanding the behavior of systems with many components for enabling new functionality and making sure they work as they should. In particular, he's interested in how to build, operate, and diagnose large scale Internet systems, and in the networks connecting them.
Recently, Rodrigo received a Best Paper Award at SOSP and won a NSF CAREER Award for his work on understanding the  performance of distributed systems through causal tracing. His work has been funded and recognized by the National Science Foundation, Google, Intel, Microsoft, and Facebook.
One way to think of Kathi Fisler’s career, she says, is that it’s been a constantly shifting balance between formal systems (and how they work) and people (and how they learn). For years an Adjunct Professor at Brown CS, she’s just been appointed Professor (Research) and Associate Director of the Undergraduate Program. It’s a momentous shift toward the latter half of that balance, letting her focus on CS education for both K-12 students and Brown ones. “This is deeply personal to me,” she says. “There’s an opportunity, a challenge, and it’s just a fun playground for me to work on connecting people with computer science.”
The main reason why the challenge of CS education has a personal dimension for Kathi originates in her first year at Williams College. Only intending to focus on mathematics and Asian studies (Chinese in particular), she was required as a math major to take CS 1. “I wasn’t very good at it, and it drove me nuts, instructing a hunk of metal and having it be totally my fault when something didn’t work.” Fisler gestures toward an empty spot on her desk as if the offending computer were right in front of her. “I didn’t fail, but I didn’t do well, either.”
Determined to prove that she could conquer programming, Kathi signed up for CS 2. By the mid-term, she was failing. But thanks to many office hours spent with a supportive faculty, she kept going: by two-thirds of the way through the year, her grades had soared, and early in CS 3, she realized that she enjoyed CS more than math. “This is one reason why I love CS education, particularly introductory courses. I deeply understand when it doesn’t work, and I know how it feels to power through the learning curve that many students face. I was the only newbie, the only woman across 3 consecutive years of CS majors. Nobody would have been surprised if I'd walked away from computer science, but thankfully I was too stubborn to do that and my brain soon caught up.”
Traveling to University of Indiana at Bloomington for her Master’s and PhD, Kathi envisioned studies in computational linguistics, but was waylaid by a hardware design course. A new research lab was starting up, and she jumped at the chance to do work that touched on math, computer science, and even philosophy: examining how people reason with diagrams, particularly in hardware design. “Traditionally,” she says, “mathematical proofs were largely written in text form, and diagrams weren’t considered rigorous. Why is that? Think about a civil engineer, who uses math and modeling instead of sending cars over an unproven bridge to see whether it collapses. Why can’t we use diagrams to reason about how a system will work?”
This line of inquiry led to research in verification techniques, and later to access control policies and their security implications. “Every problem I studied,” says Kathi, “kept coming back to the question of how humans understand a question involving computational systems.” She gives the example of Facebook privacy settings, which many people believe they understand fully, yet have resulted in numerous privacy leaks when reality didn’t match someone’s conception of how things worked.
“When you have people trying to use systems successfully,” she says, “people are the difficult part. I really want to understand what’s going on for them cognitively, psychologically, how they learn.” More than twenty years ago, that was part of the motivation for work that led to Bootstrap, a family of curricula that integrate computer science with other disciplines in K-12. Initially a “side hobby” for Fisler and her long-time collaborator, Professor Shriram Krishnamurthi, it’s now used by roughly 15,000 students per year across 17 states and five countries.
CS education has been in the news a lot lately, but what has Kathi seen in her years of research that the layperson may be unaware of? “It’s taken years to realize how much we don’t understand, how many concepts are packed into a simple programming task. The literature is overflowing with evidence that many people struggle to learn CS, and now we understand that we can’t accept the idea that some people just won’t be good at programming as an answer. Computer science is a form of literacy for everyone now: there are economic and equity issues. If we preach CS for all, we need to accept that everyone isn’t going to be a computer scientist, and think about what we teach and how we teach it.”
For years, Kathi has divided her time between being a Professor at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) and an Adjunct Professor at Brown. Recently, her juggling act (Bootstrap at Brown, research and teaching at WPI) has become unbalanced by Bootstrap’s rapid growth, which made the opportunity to consolidate all three efforts hugely appealing. Brown offered not only the perfect job description but the chance to form an entirely in-house research group that has few rivals.  
“This lets me focus,” Kathi says. “I love advising and working with students for all the reasons that I’ve mentioned, and this lets me participate more fully with Bootstrap. Together with Shriram and the rest of the group, I have a CS education team with decades of experience, deep programming language expertise, and everyone under one roof. Anywhere in the world, that’s incredibly hard to find.” Giving up the commute to Worcester may also give Kathi more time for her hobbies, which include playing music, singing, running (she notes a theme of rhythm among all three), jigsaw puzzling, and cooking vegetarian food.
But not too much spare time. There are big challenges ahead, she explains: “We need to find out how to provide broad CS education before we lose another generation. We need to enable teachers who don’t see themselves as computer scientists to introduce students to computing. This new role is my best chance yet to do the deeply personal work of taking everything that I’ve learned about systems, about learning, and to help the people who are facing one of the greatest educational tasks in history. I can work with a struggling college student at the same time that I’m looking out for an atypical learner in kindergarten or high school, and that’s so important to me.”

Brown’s annual hackathon takes place this weekend, February 4-5! Over 500 students from around the world will gather on College Hill to learn, play, and collaborate for Hack@Brown 2017. We’ve got everyone from high schoolers to graduate students, from Canada to South Korea. All in all, they represent 119 schools.
In past years, hackers have created a diverse compendium of products. First-time hackers mixed social good with Google APIs to produce SNAPy at Hack@Brown 2016, a service that allows anyone with an SMS-enabled mobile (not just a smartphone!) to request a list of grocery stores that accept food stamps. On the more humorous side of things, another 2016 team wrote Chrome extension How Many Pens. With this installed, users can opt to replace dollar amounts with their equivalent of choice – say, that shirt isn’t $20 but rather 134 BIC pens.
Beyond the projects, we’re honored to host a diverse field of speakers and mentors. Mary Fernandez, CEO of MentorNet and activist for underrepresented minorities in STEM, will be our keynote speaker this year. Sponsors include Microsoft, Google, Bracket, pMD, Polymer, a16z, Two Sigma, Facebook, Oculus, Adobe, Qualtrics, and Cimpress. The judging team is comprised of representatives from these companies and Brown faculty, ensuring both industrial and academic perspectives.
We’re excited to see what participants come up with this year, and everyone is invited to view the results. A demo fair and judging panel will take place on Sunday in Sayles Hall – make sure to stop by to check out all the great work!
Students who know about Daniel Ritchie’s arrival (he’s joining Brown CS as Assistant Professor in July) have already shared their excitement about his work in AI systems to enable creativity, generative models for graphics and design, and probabilistic programming. But given Brown’s reputation for interdisciplinary study, they may be equally enthused about the need for creativity that runs alongside his love of research and experimentation.
“As a kid I thought I’d be a novelist,” he says, “or work in music or film, the arts. Computer science started out as a hobby for me, and I didn’t know where it’d lead. I didn’t get serious about CS until college, and it wasn’t until my internship at Pixar that I realized I could bring the two interests together.”
As an undergraduate at University of California, Berkeley, Daniel studied computer graphics, working in physical simulations and developing an interest in applications that could be used in film production. Branching out into artificial intelligence and machine learning while in grad school at Stanford University, he experimented with automatic generation of common 3D environments such as bedrooms and kitchens.
“I like bringing things to life and sharing them with people,” he says. “The creativity of it always brings me the most joy.” Looking to find some joy for our own playlists and Netflix queues, we press Daniel for recent favorites across various media, and he speaks with feeling about a band called Cloud Cult (“deeply personal, lyrics about loss and fear of the unknown”), an independent film called Short Term 12, and the works of Patrick Rothfuss, citing the author’s world-building talent and ability to choose words with care.
Is computer science creative? “It absolutely is. No idea comes out of a vacuum, but new insights are required in order to make progress. Research isn’t that dissimilar to design, or the artistic process: experiment, prototype, iterate, then check direction.”
Broadly speaking, Daniel explains, his own research is about using artificial intelligence and machine learning to create content for graphics. “A lot of machine learning,” he says, “is concerned with coming up with explanations for data that we have about the world: categories, structure, how it was created.” Probabilistic programming, which repeatedly generates models, draws inferences from them, and then generates new ones, is a useful tool. Ritchie gives the example of using an algorithm to generate buildings, then automatically eliminating the ones that aren’t stable: “It’s reasoning backward from the goals that you want to satisfy.”
“That was where machine learning really clicked for me,” he explains. “The results are often surprising, which provides a lot of potential for inspiration.” It’s also democratic: “We’re augmenting what the average person is capable of, automating away tedious details, guiding them back to good design.”
With his PhD from Stanford now complete, Daniel is looking forward to his arrival at Brown and continuing his work with tools that will have a broad user base. “I want to get more people well-versed in artificial intelligence and machine learning methods, especially people who don’t become AI/ML specialists....It’s really satisfying to work with students who are just starting out in their careers, who are ready for new ideas. I like how Brown CS is a community, not a collection of research labs. That’s rare and special.”
And what’s next for his research? “There’s been an explosion of deep learning technology,” Daniel says. “I’m really interested in combining it with probabilistic programming. I'm also interested in exploring more applications for creative AI. For example, AI-assisted content creation tools in VR, or even applications beyond graphics, such as music composition.”
Despite rapid technological advances, Daniel has little fear that humans are at risk of obsolescence: “Creative AI systems are powered by some combination of carefully coded design principles and learning from examples. But people had to come up with those design principles and create those examples in the first place! So these systems depend on people; in one way or another, they capture the best of what people know about how to create. When it comes to creativity, I’m a firm believer in augmenting human capabilities, rather than trying to automate them away. Creativity provides joy for people — why would you want to automate that away?”
Commencement is a busy time, so if you want to attend, please click here to RSVP no later than April 15.
When John Savage came to Brown a half-century ago, computing was thought of as a service, not a discipline, and the idea of a Department of Computer Science at Brown was highly controversial.  Few could have predicted the infrastructure necessary today, or the challenges we face in the areas of cryptography, cybereconomics, big data, and many others.
One of the founders of Brown CS, John's interests have changed as our field has changed, leading him to contribute to such areas as computational complexity, scientific computation, computational nanotechnology, and cybersecurity policy and technology.  Join us at Room 130 of 85 Waterman Street from 2-6 PM on Friday, May 26, for a celebration of how John Savage and Brown CS evolved together, including research talks as well as personal reminiscences.  A reception will follow at 115 Waterman Street on the third floor of the CIT.  (Please note that this event will take the place of the annual Brown CS Reunion.)
Impostor syndrome, a term coined by Clance and Imes in 1978, can be described as a lack of belief in one's accomplishments and an ongoing fear that any success to date is illusory and will be discovered as false. Increasingly, it's become a topic of discussion in the field of computer science: a post about impostor syndrome to the internal Brown CS Facebook group (note that you must have a brown.edu email address linked to your Facebook profile to view this group) has resulted in more than 130 comments by faculty, students, and alums.
It appears that women and members of historically underrepresented groups are particularly prone to the syndrome, and alum Sarah Sachs explains in a recent Washington Post article that even though she graduated from Brown, won a prize for her undergraduate thesis, and earned a much-coveted job at Google, she still doubted herself on a daily basis. That changed last year, during a chance encounter with Michelle Obama: attempting to thank the First Lady for being a role model, Sarah was stunned to find Ms. Obama thanking her for her mentorship and inspiration.
"I’ve decided to take a new approach," Sarah writes. "I’m going to accept that I can need to receive support but still be able to give support to those who follow me in our field....There are other people like me looking around to see if they are alone. We aren’t. We belong."
While some privacy advocates are warily eyeing our smart refrigerators and Internet-enabled toaster ovens, Professor Shriram Krishnamurthi and PhD candidate Hannah Quay-de la Vallee of Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) have turned their attention to an area that's been largely overlooked: app stores, which power our phones and tablets as well as our smart homes.
"Most app stores," they write for Fast Company, "completely fail to help users protect their privacy." Their op-ed points out the need for preserving privacy in this "beating heart of smartphone ecosystems, where most users go to search, discover, and install apps", evaluates the current configurations at Google and Apple, and recommends simple solutions for improved privacy design thinking.

Among many other things, the visit was timely: a post about Donald Knuth’s multi-volume opus, The Art of Computer Programming, was trending on Slashdot just last week.
Earlier this month, on Thursday, December 1, 2016, and Friday, December 2, Brown University’s Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) hosted Knuth, Professor Emeritus at Stanford University. Widely regarded as an artistic genius and perhaps the most gifted programmer of all time, he delivered the 16th Paris C. Kanellakis Memorial Lecture and a John von Neumann Lecture.
“This is the most mind-boggling thing,” Knuth said at the start of the first lecture, proceeding immediately to boggle the minds of a record-size audience with insights that varied from the specific to the far-reaching and from the offhand to the profound. Below, we sketch just the outline of his visit in text, photographs, and video.
Organ Music
The mornings of both days were occupied by visits to two prominent local pipe organs, one at Brown’s Sayles Hall and the other at the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul. Knuth played a selection of Bach, seasonal favorites, and part of his own Fantasia Apocalyptica, which he described with enthusiasm and a vocabulary more reminiscent of an undergraduate than an octogenarian: “So far, I’m psyched about it!”
Explaining the mechanics of a pipe organ to his listeners, he made the computer science analogy of columns and rows, saying that there are n notes and m tonalities to choose from, and thus the total number of sounds that the organist can possibly make is at most 2 to the power m-plus-n. However, the number of pipes is m times n; therefore, if a computer were able to turn each individual pipe on or off independently, the organ would be able to produce many, many more sounds: 2 to the power m-times-n!
For example, at Sayles Hall both m and n are less than 70, so fewer than 2 to the power of 140 sounds are possible. But that organ has 3355 pipes, so it’s capable of 2 to the power of 3355 different sounds. Thus, Knuth mused, for every sound the organist can play, the instrument is actually able to make more than 64,000,000,...,000 (imagine 957 other zeroes in the expression) others. “Most of the sounds this instrument can make haven’t been heard yet,” he said. “We don’t know if the unheard ones are beautiful or not. Are we missing something important?”
Hamiltonian Paths And Satisfiability
Both lectures were spectacularly well-attended, setting Brown CS records. Introduced at one point by Professor Sorin Istrail as one of “two real-life superheroes, von Neumann and Donald Knuth”, and wearing the same brightly-colored shirt from when he spoke at the opening of the CIT in 1988, Knuth seemed to relish speaking to what he described as a “pretty geeky” audience.
The first lecture, which Knuth framed as a “history of clever ideas that arose around the world”, traced the evolution of a problem that dates back to antiquity: finding a path that encounters all points of a network without retracing its steps. Knuth’s sense of aesthetics, curiosity, and his love of minutiae and the absurd were on full display (“look at the ingenious wordplay….nonsense things like this are easy to learn”) as he took his audience from Hellenic icosahedrons to a knight’s tour of the chessboard to the sandals of Lord Rama, mentioning with offhanded modesty feats such as teaching himself enough Sanskrit to find errors in Wikipedia entries devoted to obscure treatises half a millennium old.
In the second lecture, Knuth returned the audience to his multi-decade project, The Art of Computer Programming. (“It makes a wonderful Christmas present,” he said to considerable laughter.) His subject was the concept of satisfiability, in which a formula is declared satisfiable if one can find and prove a model that makes the formula true. Again, the approach was in part historical, tracking inflection points such as the “unseen breakthrough” of lazy data structures in 1982, but Knuth also made an argument for the importance of what he described as a “million-dollar” problem. (The number refers to the value of the award given by the Clay Mathematical Institute for solutions to their Millennium Prize Problems, some of the most famous unsolved questions in mathematics.) “I didn’t anticipate,” he said, “that I was going to have 300 pages on it, but eventually I realized that satisfiability is a basic technique that deserves to be much better known, part of every programmer’s toolkit.”
The occasional digressions were equally interesting. Knuth explained that creating a graph of character interactions in Anna Karenina increased his appreciation of Tolstoy, and that he obtained “maximum insights per hour” through a technique of taking a random walk through the Bible as well as through student papers that he needed to grade. “Some people thought I graded at random,” he joked. “That wasn’t exactly true.”
Knuth And Wegner 
At the end of the first lecture, Sorin offered a champagne toast to celebrate a remarkable collaboration between Knuth and Brown CS Professor Emeritus Peter Wegner. Almost fifty years ago, Knuth explained, a “hot topic in those days” was the hope to “define the precise meaning of programs in a formal way, noting that all of the existing proposals for programming language definition at the time were too uncomplicated and unintuitive to be fruitful”.
During a visit to Wegner’s home in 1967, Peter suggested that information could be conveyed down a parse tree as well as upward from the bottom. This seemed preposterous at the time, Knuth explained, sharing the memory of how he was so agitated by the idea that he suddenly realized he was yelling instead of speaking in a normal tone. But the suggestion lingered in his mind because he understood that Peter was absolutely right. This suggestion soon led to the invention of attributed grammars. “Much of the technology of modern compilers,” write Shasha and Lazere in Out of Their Minds: the Lives and Discoveries of 15 Great Computer Scientists, “dates from these insights.”
Questions Answered
After each lecture, when students asked a variety of difficult, far-reaching, and even unanswerable questions, Knuth shone. The witticisms were present again as he answered a query as to whether a supreme deity plays dice with the universe (“God could perfectly well play dice, if that leads to a good algorithm”), but weight and seriousness returned as he urged attendees to lengthen their attention spans. “Computer science shouldn’t automatically lead directly to Wall Street,” he said; computer scientists should “advance civilization” instead.
Not even the most broad and fundamental challenges were out of bounds. When asked about what’s widely considered the most important question in computer science theory, Knuth took the unpopular position that P=NP, giving just enough detail in his response to preserve and even augment, rather than destroy, the mystery of one of the most famous problems of our discipline.
Some of Knuth’s most powerful moments were when his remarks took on the fullest possible global and cultural scope: “The notions that we now think of as computational ideas are part of world culture going way back.” Each time, whether the topic was look-ahead solvers, random sampling of the Bible, or the “thrill” of feeling like he was talking to a fellow scholar from the 13th century, segments of the talks devoted to theory and comprehensive detail were illuminated by the personal example of Knuth’s intellectual restlessness and eagerness, his unabashed love of experimentation. Even as he lamented that he was unable to persuade any of his PhD students to interest themselves in the history of computer science, he urged his audience to do so, and thereby pursue the life of ideas: “We need to see what other people have thought and how they approached problems, a combination of breadth and depth….good computer science, like good mathematics, has a long half-life.”

Barely a month after his arrival at Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS), Assistant Professor George Konidaris has received an Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) Young Investigator Research award.
The objective of the Young Investigator Research program is to foster creative basic research in science and engineering, enhance early career development of outstanding young investigators, and increase opportunities for the young investigators to recognize the Air Force mission and the related challenges in science and engineering. George's proposal ("Constructing Abstraction Hierarchies for Robust, Real-Time Control") was one of only 56 selected chosen from more than 230 proposals in areas as diverse as aerothermodynamics, theoretical chemistry, and quantum electronic solids.
"I'm interested in robot decision-making," George says. "Robots sense the world via a constant stream of noisy, high-dimensional sensations, and can only ultimately act by emitting low-level motor control signals, but decision-making at that level of detail is just unnecessarily hard. Imagine trying to figure out where to go for lunch when you can only think about where you must place each footstep, and exactly what high-resolution images you'll see along the way.
"A core theme in my research is trying to understand how to do high-level reasoning in a low-level world; this proposal addresses one specific aspect of that, which is trying to build hierarchies that allow the robot to reason about the world at just the right level -- as abstractly as possible."
Ultimately, George hopes to develop principled algorithms for autonomously learning abstraction hierarchies, and to show that such hierarchies can very rapidly generate flexible, robust, generally-capable goal-oriented behavior. "We need to get robots acting intelligently in a wide range of environments, beyond those their designers can foresee or test."
Assistant Professor Stefanie Tellex of Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) has just returned from the largest conference devoted to natural language processing (NLP), where she gave an invited talk. SIGDAT (the Association for Computational Linguistics' special interest group on linguistic data and corpus-based approaches to NLP)'s Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) 2016 was held in Austin, Texas, from November 1-5, 2016.
One of only three invited speakers, Stefanie spoke on Thursday, November 3. In her talk ("Learning Models of Language, Action and Perception for Human-Robot Collaboration"), she described robots as "force multipliers" that can assist an astronaut with a repair on the International Space station, a UAV taking flight over our cities, or an autonomous vehicle driving through our streets.
"The aim of my research program," she explains, "is to create autonomous robots that collaborate with people to meet their needs by learning decision-theoretic models for communication, action, and perception....I am creating new methods for learning how to plan in very large, uncertain state-action spaces by using hierarchical abstraction. Perception for collaboration requires the robot to detect, localize, and manipulate the objects in its environment that are most important to its human collaborator. I am creating new methods for autonomously acquiring perceptual models in situ so the robot can perceive the objects most relevant to the human's goals. My unified decision-theoretic framework supports data-driven training and robust, feedback-driven human-robot collaboration."
Now in his fiftieth year at Brown University, Professor John Savage of the Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) continues not only to consult on cybersecurity at the international level but serve as ambassador and architect for countries that are joining the global effort to improve the safety of cyberspace.
Most recently, John has returned from a week-long trip to Vietnam, where he met with political leaders, technology and cybersecurity experts, academics, and students to address what Vietnam sees as a top priority: building the necessary cyber resilience to protect their scientific and technological development. His agenda was extremely varied, ranging from discussions of an innovation center being built in the coastal city of Nha Trang to a keynote address at the Conference on Solutions for Practice on Global Citizenship Education in Cyber Civil Defense in Vietnam, held at Dalat University.
John traveled to Vietnam as a representative of the Boston Global Forum, a non-governmental organization founded in December, 2012, by Governor Michael Dukakis; Mr. Tuan Nguyen, Member of the Harvard Business School Global Advisory Board; Professor Thomas Patterson of the Harvard Kennedy School, and Professor John Quelch of the Harvard Business School. Boston Global Forum is dedicated to solving global issues of peace, and security, especially in cybersecurity.
Some highlights of John’s trips are detailed in the photos below, and you can click here to see a video clip (in Vietnamese) of his meeting with President of Vietnam Tran Dai Quang.

The Paris C. Kanellakis Memorial Lecture honors a distinguished computer scientist who was an esteemed and beloved member of our faculty. This year, on December 1 and 2, Brown CS welcomes one of the greatest minds of our discipline, widely regarded as an artistic genius, Renaissance man, and perhaps the most gifted programmer of all time, Donald Knuth. We're extremely happy to return Professor Knuth to a city that he remembers fondly (he holds an honorary doctorate from Brown, and his daughter is an alum), where he will deliver two lectures, continue a conversation with Professor Emeritus Peter Wegner that shaped the course of CS more than 50 years ago, and even take a few moments to enjoy himself by playing two prominent local pipe organs.
"Knuth Days At Brown" Schedule 
4 PM on Thursday, December 1, in CIT 368, the Paris C. Kanellakis Memorial Lecture: "Hamiltonian Paths in Antiquity"
About 1850, William Rowan Hamilton invented the Icosian Game, which involved finding a path that encounters all points of a network without retracing its steps. Variants of his game have turned out to be important in many modern computer applications. The speaker will give evidence that people have been interested in such questions since at least Graeco-Roman times. Furthermore, ingenious Sanskrit and Arabic documents from the ninth century, and continuing through medieval times, also reveal that this is perhaps the oldest nontrivial combinatorial problem in the history of civilization.
This lecture is hosted by Sorin Istrail and a reception will follow.
4 PM on Friday, December 2, in CIT 368, a John von Neumann Lecture: "The Art of Computer Programming: Satisfiability and Combinatorics"
This lecture is hosted by Sorin Istrail and Eli Upfal and a Sweat Box Session featuring rigorous questioning from graduate students and other attendees will follow.
Less than a semester after his arrival at Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS), Associate Professor Seny Kamara continues to distinguish himself as a thought leader in the areas of cryptography and security. Recently chosen as a Michael Dukakis Leadership Fellow by the Boston Global Forum, he's now been appointed to a new committee created by the National Academy of Sciences.
The committee ("Law Enforcement and Intelligence Access to Plaintext Information in an Era of Widespread Strong Encryption: Options and Tradeoffs") is part of the organization's Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences, and it will examine the tradeoffs associated with mechanisms to provide authorized government agencies with access to the plaintext version of encrypted information. 
Their work will describe the context in which decisions about such mechanisms would be made and identify and characterize possible mechanisms and alternative means of obtaining information sought by the government for law enforcement or intelligence investigations. It will seek to find ways to measure or otherwise characterize risks so that they could be weighed against the potential law enforcement or intelligence benefits. However, it will not seek to answer the question of whether access mechanisms should be required but rather will provide an authoritative analysis of options and tradeoffs.
Seny joins a select group of 13 other experts from academia and industry, including Google, Intel, Microsoft, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Stanford University.
Brown University has launched a Data Science Initiative to catalyze new research programs to address some of the world’s most complex challenges and provide students with innovative educational opportunities relating to “big data”. The initiative builds on established strengths in mathematical and computational sciences and a long history of data-related research across its core academic departments.
“From deciphering disease and improving the delivery of health care, to modeling climate change and evaluating public policies, Brown faculty are already on the cutting edge of the big data revolution,” said Brown President Christina Paxson. “The Data Science Initiative will build on that tradition and unearth new methods for using big data to solve big problems.”
Despite recent advances, growth in the volume and complexity of data continues to outpace the development of new techniques needed to translate these data into cutting edge research. At the same time, the application of big data to new questions and disciplines requires novel approaches.
In its initial stages, the Data Science Initiative will include a new one-year Master’s degree in data science, expanded undergraduate course offerings, and the addition of ten new faculty members and researchers whose research and teaching will focus on fundamental methods of data science and their application to a variety of research questions.
The Data Science Initiative aligns with Brown’s commitment, as articulated in the University’s Building on Distinction strategic plan, to taking an integrative approach to developing solutions to complex challenges — an approach that bridges and unites multiple academic areas of research and study. Brown’s departments of mathematics, applied mathematics, computer science and biostatistics will serve as the initiative’s hub, but a key focus will be to create a campus-wide community in data science, engaging students and faculty in life and physical sciences, social sciences and the humanities.
Ultimately, the initiative aims to ensure that scholars across Brown’s disciplines become fluent with data in a way that encourages them to integrate data science into their teaching and research in novel and creative ways.
“Different types of data —genome sequences, data from social networks and medical records, to name just a few— are giving rise to entirely new frameworks and theories on how to extract meaning from data,” said Jeffrey Brock, chair of the Mathematics Department and director of the initiative. “We want to explore fundamentally new techniques and methods for eliciting new knowledge from data.”
Innovative Research
In addition to more traditional research projects in the life, physical and social sciences, scholars from the Data Science Initiative will work with Brown’s Cogut Center for the Humanities to seek new connections across the cultural divide between the sciences and humanities and ways of using data in new scholarly contexts.
Partnerships with Brown’s Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs and the Center for the Study of Race and Ethnicity in America will investigate the societal and cultural impacts of data, including questions related to data access, privacy, security, equity and justice.
“As the use of big data expands in commerce, public policy and in our everyday lives, it presents new challenges that cut across disciplinary boundaries,” said Brown Provost Richard M. Locke. “Brown’s Open Curriculum and collaborative research ethos put us in a unique position to help chart the future of the data-enabled society.”
Each new research program arising from the initiative will build upon a history and tradition of data-related research in the initiative’s core departments.
In the mid 1970s, a distinguished group of Brown faculty formed the Pattern Theory Group in Applied Mathematics. That team’s work in the early stages of image processing, computer vision, the theory of artificial neural networks and other areas established foundational data manipulation techniques widely used today.
Computer scientists at Brown are developing new algorithms and machine learning techniques for automated analysis of large datasets that may include text, audio, video and other types of information. Scholars are also creating new types of systems for manually searching, manipulating and visualizing data. Roboticists are using crowdsourcing and other big data techniques to increase the capabilities of robotic technologies.
The Department of Mathematics has research strengths in topology, geometry and graph theory, areas of pure mathematics that have found new application in data science. These techniques use the “shape” of datasets to identify clusters indicative of, for example, hubs in a social network or subtypes of a particular disease. These strengths complement those in harmonic analysis and cryptography, already central areas of data-related expertise.
Biostatistics faculty have leveraged data to create better screening protocols for lung cancer and public health strategies for preventing HIV spread. Researchers help to process genomic data to look for the mutations that drive cancer, as well as leveraging various datasets for precise and personalized treatment of individual patients.
“Building outward from these core departments, Brown will engage with the foundational questions of the data revolution, becoming a lighthouse for methodological innovation in data science,” Brock said.
Educational Opportunities
The management consulting firm McKinsey & Company estimates that by 2018, the U.S. will have a shortage of 1.5 million managers capable of using data analysis to make informed decisions. There will be an additional shortage of as many as 190,000 employees with deep data skills necessary to develop complex analyses and communicate findings through visual media.
To prepare students for the data-enabled economy, faculty in the Data Science Initiative will partner with departments across campus to create data science course sequences to promote data fluency in students studying in a variety of disciplines. New faculty added through the initiative will expand the course options already available at Brown. Current course offerings include two introductory courses —“Data Fluency for All” in Computer Science and “What’s the Big Deal with Data Science” in Applied Math— both designed to introduce the field to students without much experience with data science techniques.
The master’s program, which began recruiting its initial cohort this month, will offer a deeper dive into the methods applied by data scientists. In addition to a core curriculum focusing on foundational mathematical and computational techniques, an elective class will let students explore particular applications of their choice. A capstone project will help students apply what they’ve learned to real-world questions and problems.
“The program aims to provide students with the deep data fluency necessary for leadership in data-centric careers,” said Carsten Binnig, adjunct professor of computer science and director of the master’s program. “Courses will provide a fundamental understanding of the tools of data science that students can apply in a huge variety of careers, whether in business, health care delivery, academic research or something else.”
In both the educational and research mission of the Data Science Initiative, Brock said that collaboration across the disciplines will drive the initiative as an overarching theme.
“You never know when a technique applied to a data problem will be useful in another,” Brock said. “An approach used by one of our physicists sifting through the data produced by the Large Hadron Collider could be helpful to someone who is looking at data on how people behave in an economic market.
“We want the Data Science Initiative to be a place where those connections are made.”
The Department of Computer Science at Brown University (Brown CS) seeks applicants under a focused cluster hiring plan for multiple anticipated tenure-track faculty positions in the area of machine learning, broadly construed (including, but not limited to machine learning for speech, vision, robotics and text; machine learning theory; systems and languages for machine learning; deep learning; unsupervised learning; relational learning; reinforcement learning; optimization; and data mining).
Brown is launching a university-wide Data Science Initiative being led by the Computer Science, Applied Math, Biostatistics and Math departments, who are closely collaborating to create a rich, multi-disciplinary research and education environment around data science and engineering. The Data Science Initiative identified machine learning as a priority area. Successful candidates are expected to actively participate in these ongoing efforts.

Brown University is pleased to welcome the first student cohort to begin its newly launched Executive Master in Cybersecurity (EMCS) program. The 16-month EMCS program, with classes beginning this week, builds on the university’s interdisciplinary excellence in cybersecurity, highly accomplished faculty and students, and practical, hands-on experience to produce visionary and confident leaders who understand the technology, human, and policy issues that form a successful cybersecurity strategy and can lead transformative change within their organizations.
The class of 2018 is a diverse group of 28 accomplished professionals averaging 17 years of experience in a variety of sectors and professional roles. From a current U.S. Marine to marketing professionals, practicing attorneys, security officers, consultants and investors, the selectivity and diversity of the student cohort are key benefits of the program. Students are selected based on what they will contribute to the peer learning community and their readiness to benefit from the program.
"With unique education and experience, every student is an important contributor to the cohort," said Alan Usas, EMCS Program Director. "Not only do the students selected act as valuable resources for peers, but they become a trusted member of the lifelong professional networks that forms. We have a very strong group entering the program and we are prepared to graduate visionary and strategic leaders to meet the global, technical, human and policy challenges of cybersecurity."
According to the recently published report, "The State of Cyber Security Professional Careers," conducted by independent research firm, Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG), 46 percent of organizations claim to have a problematic shortage of cyber security skills and nearly two-thirds (65%) of cyber security professionals struggle to define their career paths. Operating on the central tenet that Strategy is the Best Security, the comprehensive and timely curriculum of the EMCS program prepares students with the conceptual framework and readiness to respond to challenges in cybersecurity, including:
For the first time in the university's history, Brown opened the ceremonial Van Wickle gates to EMCS students during the Oct. 16 convocation. Opened only three times a year for convocation, mid-year graduation and commencement, the opening of the Van Wickle gates for the EMCS students ushers in a new tradition for the university and underscores the importance of the Executive Master portfolio of programs, and its students, to the Brown community.
According to Jonathan Powell, who has just finished leading the new Mosaic+ Transition Program, which helps underrepresented minority (URM) students prepare for studying computer science at Brown University, his experience as a new CS student was shared by many of his peers.
“I was interested in the program,” he says, “because I heard a lot of second-year URM students talking about the struggles that they’d had. The academics were part of it, but even the small things, like finding where labs are and setting up your account, they’re all barriers. CS has a fundamentally different learning curve, and it starts very early. For many students, their experience in high school helped build fundamental skills in math, writing, and other areas that they need for college courses. But for computer science, very few schools have a curriculum that helps build that foundation. That’s what we’re trying to do.”  
In the spring of 2015, Mosaic+ began working on what they call a “two-tier solution centered around the social and academic issues” faced by URM students: a Transition Program that would take place just before their arrival at Brown, and a Mentoring Program that would continue afterward. According to Mosaic+ co-coordinators Nifemi Madarikan and Chelse Steele, the student organization “seeks to equip these students with the resources, skills, and support structure that will allow them to thrive at Brown and become the next generation of computer scientists from the moment they step onto campus”.
A great deal of research followed. With assistance from Department Chair Ugur Cetintemel, Vice-Chair Tom Doeppner, and Professor Shriram Krishnamurthi, Mosaic+ studied programs at University of Michigan, Stanford University, and other schools to find models of engagement and useful best practices. They also partnered with Brown’s New Scientist Catalyst summer program, which helps incoming URM students in science, technology, engineering, and math, but doesn’t focus on CS.
“It was really Chelse and Nifemi’s brainchild,” says Laura Dobler, the Brown CS Financial and Outreach Coordinator, who works extensively with Mosaic+ on diversity-related initiatives. “The Transition Program is a comprehensive solution for so many different types of problems. For URM students, it’s not just about helping them past the learning curve of doing research, it’s about creating a community, leveling the playing field, providing mentors and resources, and doing everything we can to make their experience more typical.”
Thirteen students arrived in August as the program’s first cohort. Their mornings were spent on the Transition Program’s technical curriculum, designed to introduce them to functional and object-oriented programming concepts, build technical skill, and expose them to various CS applications. It included lectures, tech talks and demos, labs, and problem sets, culminating in the creation of a unique app.
“We wanted students to create something they could really use,” Jonathan explains, “to learn about databases and JavaScript but have a product at the end and an ‘I made this’ moment.” Many volunteers contributed to the effort, with Shriram, Elbert Wang, and Abdul Raziq Tabish playing a key role by developing the curriculum and the online instructional component. Jewel Brown and Ebube Chuba both gave talks on student groups, academic technology, and interdisciplinary possibilities with computer science. Purvi Goel created a Pokémon Go-inspired augmented reality tour of the CIT, and Joanna Simwinga documented the entire program, taking pictures and providing support.
Afternoons provided a bit of a break in the form of the non-technical curriculum, which prepared students for other aspects of academic life, such as Brown CS culture and campus resources. Field trip destinations included the Boston Museum of Science, the Google headquarters in Boston, and New Hampshire’s Mount Monadnock. Jonathan credits Laura as well as Lynsey Ford of the Science Center for the “administrative acrobatics” of many emails sent, phone calls made, and releases and waivers tracked down.
“It was really a success,” he says. “Even as we were doing it, we were thinking of things to do differently next year, like making sure that we have all the faculty members who teach intro courses join us as speakers, but I’m proud that we not only covered things like programming and coursework but also gave students the full set of skills they need to do well.”
“This is Mosaic+ really giving back to the next generation,” Laura adds. “It’s a wonderful thing to be a part of.” In the future, Brown CS is hoping to build on the success of this program by extending it or creating similar programs for students from other historically underrepresented groups (HUGs) as well.
“I’m grateful to everyone who jumped in with their spare time and engaged with our participants,” says Jonathan. “The students told me again and again how much they valued hearing about our experiences and seeing a community designed just for them start sprouting up around them. Now, with the Mentoring Program getting started, we’re going to take that skill-building and support to a whole new level.”

Extracting meaning and value from increasingly complex and voluminous data requires a distinct set of skills, methods, and tools that form the emerging discipline of Data Science. Brown’s Data Science Initiative (DSI) is an interdisciplinary collaboration between four core foundational departments (Applied Mathematics, Biostatistics, Computer Science, and Mathematics) and domain disciplines that aims to catalyze data-enabled science and scholarship across the campus, creating new opportunities for innovation in both its methods and application.
The DSI is happy to announce the creation of a new Master's program that will draw on Brown’s strengths in Data Science and offer students from a wide range of disciplinary backgrounds a rigorous, distinctive, and attractive education for building a career in Data Science and/or Big Data management.
The program's main goal is to provide a fundamental understanding of the methods and algorithms of Data Science. This understanding will be achieved through a study of relevant topics in mathematics, statistics, and computer science, including machine learning, data mining, security and privacy, visualization, and data management. Additionally, a Data and Society course will prepare students for ethical and societal challenges and considerations surrounding data science, and final “capstone” projects will provide experience in important, frontline Data Science problems in a variety of fields.
Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) is happy to announce that Sherief Reda of the School of Engineering has just been given a secondary joint appointment to Brown CS. He joins R. Iris Bahar, Pedro Felzenszwalb, and Ravindra Pendse, who have similar joint status. His collaboration and theirs further strengthen the interdisciplinary approach that the university and both the School of Engineering and Brown CS are known for, offering students numerous new educational and research possibilities. 
Sherief, now Associate Professor of Engineering and Computer Science, joined the Computer Engineering group at Brown in 2006 after receiving his Ph.D. in computer science and engineering from University of California, San Diego. He received his B.Sc. (with Honors) and M.Sc. in electrical and computer engineering from Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt in 1998 and 2000. His research interests are in the area of computer engineering, with focus on energy-efficient computing systems, design automation and test of integrated circuits, and reconfigurable computing. Prof. Reda has over 60 refereed conference and journal papers (Google scholar profile). He served as a member of technical program committees for many IEEE/ACM conferences including DAC, ICCAD, ASPDAC, DATE, ICCD, GLSVLSI, and SLIP. Professor Reda received a number of awards and acknowledgments, including a best paper award in DATE 2002, a hot article in Operations Research letters in 2004, a first place award in ISPD VLSI placement contest in 2005, best paper nominations in ICCAD 2005, ASPDAC 2008, Brown's Salomon award in 2008, a NSF CAREER award, a best paper award in ISLPED 2010, and a best paper nomination in ICCAD 2015. His research is funded by NSF, DoD, DARPA, AMD, Intel and Qualcomm. He is a senior member of IEEE.
For many of us, being handed a C++ compiler in high school would have been a difficult and inauspicious introduction to computer science. Not so for George Konidaris, who joins Brown CS as assistant professor this autumn: as a teenager, growing up in South Africa, he had mostly used computers for games, but the compiler looked interesting. “It was magical,” he says of teaching himself to program. “It was a profound change for me, a mini-intellectual revolution. The world shifted half a degree on its axis. That’s really where I learned how to think.”
A love of research has spanned George’s entire career, and as a teenager, the tools for seeking knowledge were close at hand. An older sister, having graduated with a joint degree in computer science and economics, no longer needed her textbooks. “I plundered them,” says George. “It was fascinating, and I became very serious about learning everything about computers that I could.”
“Starting out as an undergraduate at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg,” he explains, “I was drawn to artificial intelligence.” To Konidaris, it had the biggest, most interesting open questions.
George’s social circle shared his interest in research. “Five of my friends from university ended up getting their PhDs overseas. We hung out every day, and we talked each other into the idea of studying abroad.” He won a scholarship to do his Master’s degree in the UK, and chose the University of Edinburgh for their strong programs in artificial intelligence but also robotics, which had been of increasing interest throughout his undergraduate years. After Edinburgh, his travels took him to the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where he earned his PhD, leaving him with four degrees from universities on three different continents.
What was the appeal of robotics? Konidaris sums up his thoughts with a simple statement that turns unexpectedly introspective. (It may also explain the ease with which he puts his arm around one of his own robots and smiles for a photograph.) “If the brain is a computer, and I think it is, then humans are robots.”  
Asked to explain his unbroken interest in research, George says that it’s been interesting, fun, and turned out to be something he was “reasonably good” at. “When you look at the history of computer science, it’s very inspiring. Its researchers are brilliant, just amazing people. And, in the space of a generation, they changed the world in a profound way.”  
Konidaris describes his own work as an attempt to design intelligent robots. “Robots have the fundamental problem of making plans and generating action when they’re doomed to interface with the world at the level of the pixel and the motor. That’s their reality. But to achieve more complex behavior, to do something like having a robot get to the right gate at an airport to catch a plane, we need them to be able to make abstractions, to plan using higher-level concepts. At the moment, it’s more like they have to carefully plan every individual footstep and then struggle with things like recognizing what the right gate looks like when the scene has changed even a little bit. I’m interested in helping them gain the ability to reason and learn at the right level for solving the problem at hand.”
He’s in good company. George says that he’s always wanted to work with faculty members like Amy Greenwald, Michael Littman, and Stefanie Tellex. “It was just too tempting! Brown CS is a great fit for me. It was a combination of things: a department that’s really good at what it does, an outstanding place that’s really friendly.” Konidaris is eager to meet students as well. “A career in computer science can be a lifetime commitment,” he says. “I hope people are looking ahead, not at just the next big thing but the long run. I think it’s important for all of us to look back at the end of our contributions and see something that’s been worthy of an intellectual lifetime.”
“We have responsibilities as scientists, and a need for rigor,” says James Tompkin, who joins Brown CS as Assistant Professor this summer. But, watching a video overview of his recent research, the areas of inquiry sometimes surprise. Sophisticated editing of image and video content, new interaction and display devices from light fields, and...animal-shaped glockenspiels? “There’s also space for more fun,” laughs James, “and for the understanding that people are human.”
This understanding is represented in James’s interest in interaction, a thread that runs through almost a decade of research. “I create graphics, vision, and interaction techniques to improve our understanding of the connections within media,” he explains, “to further our ability to edit and explore the visual world.” The interest in interaction may have early origins: as a child, growing up in the London suburbs, he favored Fighting Fantasy non-linear gamebooks, tabletop and computer strategy games like X-COM, and “played tremendously with LEGO”. His father, the headmaster of a local high school, would bring home a succession of clunky, barely-portable computers, “...and then I would break them,” James grins, “as part of the ‘learning process’.”
Combined interests in computation and music spiralled outward from those early days of tinkering, leading to an undergraduate thesis at King’s College London in novel interaction methods for composing music. Later, at University College London, Tompkin’s work with visual computing and his association with architects at the interdisciplinary Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis only heightened his interest in not just the interactive but the tangible. “I like interfaces that exist in the real world,” he says, “and if you want more natural interfaces, you have to build them. A lot of my work is pixel-pushing, but sometimes you want to go into a machine shop and build something.”
After work at the Intel Visual Computing Institute, the Max-Planck-Institute for Informatics, and recent postdoctoral research at the Harvard Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, James found himself drawn to the “exceptional” students of Brown and the faculty’s rapport with them. “I think Brown is different. There’s a focus on teaching and really a will to support students. The ratio of TAs to undergraduate students is impressive, and I’ve worked with a Brown CS PhD, so I have a healthy respect for them too.” James is also enthusiastic about the proximity to the Rhode Island School of Design. “I have so much appreciation for the work of designers,” Tompkin says. “Computer scientists, we’re so in the box! It helps to look outside.”
So, what is he excited about doing here at Brown? James pauses for a second. “Computer graphics is in a very interesting position at the moment. In many ways, we’ve already solved the grand challenge of realistic image synthesis. Think about that: how many fields can say, ‘We did it all in about fifty years. Sorry!’ That amazes me.” But the amazement quickly gives way to a maker’s eagerness: “In visual computing, I see a mismatch between how we see and interact with the world and the tools that we use to capture it. Video is most similar to how we actually see. It’s a powerful medium: extremely fun, highly creative, good for storytelling, but it’s still very difficult to use. My research tries to remove some of these barriers to self-expression. I’m so pleased that as a community, we’re developing cheap and good ways for people to use cameras to make rich models of the world around them. This lets us give powerful new tools to novices and professionals, and expand what is possible with media, especially interactive media.”
As the credits roll on his research video and an orchestral score wafts in, Tompkin casually tosses out one more marvel: an antique view camera with a tablet housed inside, letting the viewer explore the Hitchcock classic Rear Window in real time as the voyeur, panning and zooming and changing perspective. “Most of the things people want to do are related to the real world,” James notes, “firmly grounded in reality. That’s why I try to make camera-captured media easier to create, analyse, and explore.” But like everything else on his resume, this looks highly creative. And extremely fun.
James will be teaching CSCI2951-I: Computer Vision for Graphics and Interaction in the fall.
2016 continues to be a significant year for Assistant Professor Stefanie Tellex of Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS), who has just won a NASA Early Career Faculty Award for a recent proposal ("Human-Robot Collaboration on Complex Tasks"). Earlier this year, she received a Sloan Fellowship, was listed in MIT Technology Review's 2016 Breakthrough Technologies, and was named one of four "Women Who Changed Science In 2015" by Wired UK. The Early Career Faculty Award recognizes outstanding faculty researchers early in their careers, challenging them to examine the theoretical feasibility of ideas and approaches that are critical to making science, space travel, and exploration more effective, affordable, and sustainable.
Stefanie's prior research has uniquely prepared her for the task of contributing to the advancement of space exploration. She first developed probabilistic models that enable a robot to infer actions in the physical world that correspond to natural language descriptions, then extended this work to enable robots to ask natural language questions that clarify ambiguous commands and eventually to ask for help. 
"A robotic collaborator," she explains, "must be an integrated system which is able to perceive the environment and perform a diverse set of actions to accomplish different tasks. We've seen fully autonomous systems that can assemble furniture, delivery library books, and even cook, and our approach focuses on planning in very large state spaces like these, but integrated into a communication and learning framework. Existing approaches suffer from problems in slow inference because they don't use state representations and conditional independence assumptions that exploit problem structure."
Tellex's solution is to design efficient state representations and factored inference algorithms that lead to efficient reasoning and inference. This factored, hierarchical structure leads to information-gathering behavior, such as asking questions, in a framework that supports efficient incorporation of multimodal observations from low-level sensors, human language and gesture, and background knowledge. The aim of her proposal is to test the hypothesis that a system can increase speed and accuracy at inferring human intentions and increase the number of robots a single astronaut can supervise by inferring a person’s mental state from their language utterances and actively asking questions when confused. (For example, a robot could ask its operator if she meant the Philips screwdriver or the flat-head screwdriver.) The end goal is to achieve seamless human-robot cooperation on complex tasks, approaching the ease and accuracy of human-human collaboration.
"Robots that can use fluid language at multiple levels of abstraction," Stefanie says, "can flexibly respond to a person’s requests. The ultimate impact is a world where robots actively interpret a person’s instructions, asking questions when they're confused, and asking for help when they encounter a problem."
Congressional Quarterly Roll Call recently interviewed Professor John Savage of Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) to document a unique moment in history. "The May 26-27 meeting of the Group of Seven in Ise-Shima, Japan," writes Paul Merrion, "produced the G7's first-ever stand-alone agreement on cybersecurity, data protection and internet governance."
To give a bit of history, the Boston Global Forum (BGF), chaired by former governor Michael Dukakis, was founded to bring together thought leaders and experts from around the globe to participate in open public forums to discuss and illuminate the most critical issues affecting the world at large. In February, their CEO, Tuan Nguyen, asked John to address BGF and prepare an agenda for the G7 Summit, working with other individuals affiliated with BGF to develop his presentation into a formal proposal.
The G7 agreement ("The G7 Ise-Shima Leaders' Declaration"), which draws on the work of Savage and his colleagues, makes the landmark statement that cyberspace is under the rule of national law, and advocates for responsible state behavior during peacetime and the development of confidence-building measures to increase security. "It's very significant," John says. "It's progress, it's recognition that nations need to help one another."
The full article, located here, is only available to subscribers, but a summary of the Declaration is available here.
A letter to the Brown University community from President Christina Paxson on May 27, 2016, announced that Maurice Herlihy and Eli Upfal of the Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) have joined colleagues from across the University in being appointed to named chairs. Maurice is the An Wang Professor of Computer Science, and Eli is the Rush C. Hawkins Professor of Computer Science. The appointment honors the two men for their achievements and years of service and serves as another milestone for Brown CS, which now has a total of six named chairs.
The past two years have been important ones for Maurice: on July 15, 2014, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) honored him with a 60th Birthday Celebration in Paris at the ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing. Just last year, he was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, joining leading thinkers in science, public affairs, business, arts and humanities. Most recently, he received the ACM SIGOPS (Special Interest Group on Operating Systems) Hall of Fame Award, recognizing the most influential Operating Systems papers from at least ten years in the past.
"It's an honor," he says, "to be appointed to the Wang chair, named for one of New England's tech pioneers. I'm grateful to the department and the university for their support." 
Eli has been similarly busy. Less than a year ago, he won a Brown Institute for Brain Science Innovation Award for his research into better understanding the activity of specific neural networks in the brain and how they change dynamically during learning. His research continues to span a variety of areas: last year, he published ten papers on topics ranging from hard-core theory of computing to computational biology, parallel computing, and knowledge discovery. Most recently, his research group had a remarkable two full papers and one poster paper accepted at the Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD 2016).
"Any success I've had here," Eli says, "was mainly due to the amazing students and post-docs that I have worked with at Brown. My background was mostly in math and statistics, and it was the collaboration with colleagues at Brown and elsewhere that made this knowledge relevant to CS."
"Both Maurice and Eli," says Department Chair Ugur Cetintemel, "have been doing innovative work that pushes the boundaries of computer science, making an impact within and outside of our discipline. We're pleased that they are being acknowledged with these prestigious named chairs."
Notable this year for the size of the graduating class (168 undergrads, breaking last year's record by 28%) and every year for sentiment, well-deserved pride, and a sense of fun, Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) celebrated Commencement 2016 this past weekend.
Festivities began on Friday with the Hooding Ceremony, where friends and family members applauded as graduating Master's students received Brown CS sweatshirts and graduating PhD students were "hooded" by their advisors, who placed hooded sweatshirts directly over their heads, often to the sound of laughter.
Saturday was the 37th Anniversary Brown CS Reunion, and as always, the third floor of the CIT overflowed as the entire Brown CS community of students, alums, faculty, staff, family, and friends rejoined each other to celebrate. This year, Brown CS recognized two alums, Sridhar Ramaswamy and Norm Meyrowitz, celebrating their achievements and dedication to the Department with a special ceremony and champagne toast.
The capstone of the weekend took place on Sunday, when a record number of students walked down the aisle of the First Unitarian Church to receive their diplomas.
Congratulations to all our graduates! Photos of all three events (Commencement photos are still being processed) are available at https://flic.kr/s/aHskAjGMd5.
Brown University's Department of Computer Science (Brown CS) is proud to announce that alum Sridhar Ramaswamy's achievements in the field have earned him the Horace Mann Medal. Dean Peter M. Weber will present the award, given annually to a Brown University Graduate School alum who has made significant contributions to their field, at the Graduate School Doctoral Ceremony on May 29, 2016. Sridhar joins Brown CS alum Ingrid Carlbom, who received the Distinguished Graduate School Alumni Award (later replaced by the Horace Mann Medal) in 2000.
Part of a group of senior executives who report directly to CEO Sundar Pichai, Ramaswamy is currently the Senior Vice President of Advertising and Commerce at Google, where he oversees the design, innovation, and engineering of the company's advertising and commerce products. As leader of the engineering teams that helped define the vision and direction of AdWords, which built Google's multi-billion-dollar advertising business, he now directs the company's efforts in search advertising, display and video advertising, Google Shopping, Android Pay, and many other global platforms.
Prior to joining Google, Sridhar worked for Bellcore and Bell Labs, helping create a revolutionary system called AQUA (Approximate QUery Answering) that was aimed at providing provable guarantees for fast answers on massive datasets. His research provided the first efficient algorithm for mining outliers in large datasets and is considered a pioneering contribution to the field. Since then, his numerous innovations include the creation of online auction models with highly precise ad delivery, the development of a scientific framework and platform for understanding how website layouts and user interface components impact online monetization, and the establishment of ads quality systems.
Sridhar received his PhD in Computer Science in 1995 but continues to contribute to Brown CS, serving in the inaugural cohort of the Department's Advisory Board and delivering the first lecture in the IT Leaders Lecture Series. Interviewed prior to the event, he spoke of his love for solving the unsolvable: "What excites me is that computing itself is very young. It’s only begun to touch numerous aspects of our life. I can point kids to so many different areas and tell them that there are thousands of possible futures there, just waiting!”
"This is tremendous news," says Brown CS Department Chair Ugur Cetintemel. "We're proud of Sridhar's remarkable accomplishments and their daily impact on so many people worldwide. He's unique: our students who hope to lead and innovate in both technology and business couldn't ask for a better role model."  
Less than a year after earning a Sheridan Junior Faculty Teaching Fellowship, Paul Valiant of Brown University's Computer Science Department (Brown CS) has been chosen by the graduating senior class to receive the Barrett Hazeltine Citation for his efforts teaching the wildly successful Design and Analysis of Algorithms course each fall. Named for a beloved professor emeritus, the award recognizes excellence in teaching, guidance, and support by two members of the faculty and/or administration. Paul will be recognized at the President's Reception for the class on Monday, May 23, and he joins numerous notable prior recipients, including award-winning author James Morone, Barbara Tannenbaum of the Department of Theatre Arts and Performance Studies, and Michael Lysaght, founder and director emeritus of Brown University’s Center for Biomedical Engineering.
