"In some ways, we are already living in the future. In others, we are mired in the past while adversaries surge ahead. Decades of global stability have allowed our technology advantage to erode while our brightest minds work on problems of convenience and entertainment.
‍
In that time, consumer and commercial technology has outpaced the defense industry in both capability and cost. Developments in AI, drones, and sensor fusion have thrived in the private sector resulting in the commoditization of the same advancements that will win and deter future conflicts.

We are a team of experts from Oculus, Palantir, General Atomics, SpaceX, Tesla and Google exploiting breakthroughs in consumer and commercial technology to radically evolve our defense capabilities."
