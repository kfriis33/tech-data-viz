"Dropbox
Backup and share files in the cloud.
Dropbox is building the world’s first smart workspace.
Back in 2007, making work better for people meant designing a simpler way to keep files in sync. Today, it means designing products that reduce busywork so you can focus on the work that matters.
Most “productivity tools” get in your way. They constantly ping, distract, and disrupt your team’s flow, so you spend your days switching between apps and tracking down feedback. It’s busywork, not the meaningful stuff. We want to change this.
We believe there’s a more enlightened way to work. Dropbox helps people be organized, stay focused, and get in sync with their teams.

We're building a highly automated lab in Foster City running on our custom software and are currently testing relapsed/refractory cancer patients as well as samples from a variety of pharma/biotech partnerships.

And nobody bears the brunt of the current housing crisis more than young folks, who, compared to their parents and grandparents, find themselves saddled with more debt and in possession of fewer assets.

But it doesn't have to be this way.

At ZeroDown, we're driven by the radical idea that professionals with steady jobs and healthy finances should be able to afford homes - even in San Francisco. That's why we've come up with an alternative to the rent-or-own dilemma, offering the benefits of homeownership with the flexibility of renting. Here's how it works:

1. ZeroDown buys your home
Choose any home on the market. We'll make an all cash offer on your behalf.

2. Build towards ownership
A portion of your payment goes toward building ownership in your home.

"Next generation messaging for wearablesOur upcoming Apple Watch app Cufflink, is being called a top 20 app and ""Slack for your personal life"", by Business Insider :)  Apple’s approach to smartwatch communication:  * It’s broad network (receive from anyone) * It’s has limited NLP “smart replies”  * It mostly relies on dictation  Our approach is different. Cufflink provides instant discreet communication with a limited number of people (those who really matter), through pre-defined topics with Templates for Communication and Actions.  For example, your wife might send you a message ""Can you call the contractor today?"" and tag it as a to-do. Your options are “OK” and ”Sorry, I can’t”. Tap “OK” and a reply is sent to your wife, the item is added to your to-do list and you receive automatic reminders.   Why this approach?  * Notifications on your wrist are VERY PERSONAL * Smartwatch interactions need to be 5 seconds max * Dictation is slow and inappropriate for most circumstances * Our prior apps show that Templates work"

"The free HIV vaccine (YC W14)We are a Y Combinator (W14) backed non profit that is developing an HIV vaccine and distributing it worldwide for free.  If proven effective, our vaccine will turn those who receive it into HIV controllers. HIV controllers are naturally immune to HIV.  ~1 out of 300 of those living with HIV have this ability.  To develop our vaccine, we leveraged the work of accomplished computer scientists using statistical analysis to sift through blood samples from HIV controllers, identifying the virus surface targets favored by them.  These targets were then formulated into a vaccine prototype.  We have completed a 400-mouse-study (details in additional info below; results submitted to a PRJ).  We completed an ex-vivo study with human blood (video: youtu.be/lZKPbEM3oOY).  Via single sphere phagocytosis of our HIV epitope loaded spheres, these antigen presenting cells will process the epitope, creating a Killer T cell immune response, attacking HIV at its weak points."

"A social marketplace for collectors Clect connects the high-spending collector communities with a one-stop marketplace where people can browse, sell and collect.   Right now, most collectors share via Pinterest, get social on Facebook, then buy through eBay. This is inefficient. We are combining all these experiences by creating a home for this fractured audience to not only house their collections to share and sell, but browse the collections of others - turning it into one simple and fun package.  We are launching with the Comic-Con crowd, some of the most passionate collectors of popular culture. They are a community that, in the last year alone, spent $6 billion through eBay and topped two million attendees at the top 10 Comic-Cons globally. We anticipate this targeted launch will allow use to easily scale into other collectible markets, such as sports, coins and music. There are over 200 million serious collectors worldwide and hundreds of millions of hobby based collectors. The market is huge."

Proven engagementCreating successful content is not easy, especially with: increased competition for attention, expanding consumption and delivery models, and audience fragmentation just to name a few. Existing tools and services are just doing more of what doesn't work faster.

Enter Written.  Nearly all of the content a brand needs already exists. That content already has readers, and a meaningful and engaged audience. Written licenses content from the Web’s top bloggers. We match a brands audience and keywords to top-ranking content by bloggers that their audience trusts. It’s instant audience, instant visibility, and most importantly, it’s authentic engagement.
