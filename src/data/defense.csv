"High Altitude Lighter Than Air PlatformSkycom's High Altitude Lighter Than Air Platforms (HALTAPs) will create low-cost cell towers in the sky, slashing mobile service providers’ cost of doing business and allowing rapid expansion into new markets.   HALTAPs are geostationary airships that float above 60,000 ft altitude to create a high-speed wireless network in the sky. The patent-pending technology at the core of our HALTAP design revolutionizes the lighter than air industry, and will allow us to achieve what other technologies can't: the first affordable, long endurance telecom platforms in the stratosphere.  The primary barrier to long-duration flight of lighter-than-air aircraft in the stratosphere has been lifting gas loss. Most solutions either work with these short flight times (e.g. Project Loon), or combat leakage with heavy, expensive, and impractically huge envelopes (e.g. Lockheed Martin's HALE-D). Skycom's elegant solution will facilitate unprecedented flight times, while keeping costs extremely low."
"An Eye Exam For Your Brain From MITNewly discovered science at MIT reveals that our brains create blind spots and sweet spots in our field of vision. An eye exam measures how well you see something. Testing your brain measures how much and how fast you can see things at once. SplitSage has exclusive rights to MIT’s patented process and allows people to compensate to see more and miss less in split second situations. SplitSage's software measures an individual's field of vision and unique cognitive capacity. Essentially an eye exam for the brain, we create a heat map that shows where someone will always see something as well as where they will tend to miss something.   SplitSage also establishes a baseline for each individual and can identify when their brains are not functioning as normal. Things like sleep deprivation, stress, alcohol or disease can impact a person's decision making. Essentially a breathalyzer for your brain, we also assess people's cognitive function.    "

"Modularity between rifles and scopes (like DSLR body & lens)Our technology removes the proprietary relationship of one scope to one rifle. Currently, a scope may only be calibrated (zeroed) to one rifle at a time. Since the zeroing process is fairly painful to perform, most users end up purchasing duplicate sighting systems to perform the same task on different firearms.  Our technology reverses the zeroing process by zeroing the rifle to the scope. In this way, the proprietary zero of the rifle remains in the rifle and sighting systems can be freely swapped across rifles without the loss of zero.  Our customers are the majority of firearms users who would rather ""buy once, cry once"" when it comes to owning combat grade, top quality sighting systems and make the most use of them.   "

"High Performance, Environmentally Clean Solid Rocket PropellantTraditional solid rocket fuel used in missiles and space launch vehicles has two primary problems: (1) it burns inefficiently, resulting in up to a 10% fuel loss during combustion that prevents the rocket from realizing its full range and payload capacity, and (2) it emits highly toxic hydrochloric acid (“HCl”) that is destructive to the environment and corrodes launch equipment, resulting in substantial maintenance and environmental remediation costs.   Adranos has solved these two problems by developing a new rocket fuel formulation called ALITEC that maximizes fuel efficiency and virtually eliminates HCl production. At a 45% lower cost, ALITEC will allow space launch vehicles, satellites, and ballistic missiles up to a 68% extended range, a 65% increased payload capacity (i.e., up to a 33 second increase in delivered specific impulse based on one metric ton of propellant), and a 99% reduction in HCl. Adranos developed ALITEC at Purdue University’s Maurice J. Zucrow Laboratories."

Advanced Vehicles and Engines for Space and FlightENGINES  PDHTF	Pulse Detonation Hi-Bypass Turbofan PDLTF	Pulse Detonation Low-Bypass Turbofan PDM	Pulse Detonation multi-cycle Turbofan Scramjet Rocket   Pulse detonation engines (PDEs) use a small chambered explosion of fuel to provide thrust rather than a continuous burn of fuel in a turbine.  The difference is in the speed.  The flame from the combustion of fuel in a turbine proceeds at subsonic speeds while the detonation of fuel in a PDE proceeds at supersonic speeds.   AVEI proprietary designs use unique multi-chambered designs to produce hybrids between PDEs and turbine technology.  This unique approach produces more power and greater fuel efficiency then current engine designs.  We believe that these PD turbines will revolutionize the aerospace engine industry.   Our PDM engine with the ARN (annular rocket nozzle) concept is for a new horizontal take-off and landing reusable launch vehicle to put satellites and humans in to orbit.

"Revolutionary Muzzle BrakesAs modern combat and competitive shooting develops, the need for increased firepower becomes more pressing. The capability to deliver quick and accurate follow up shots provide a significant advantage in these situations. For the competitor it can mean winning the competition, for soldiers or law enforcement officers it can be a matter of life or death.   For decades, shooters have tried to reduce recoil with a device called a muzzle brake, which reverses propellant gasses exiting the barrel.  It acts much like a thrust reverser on a landing airplane.  These brakes are effective at reducing recoil up to about one-third, but due to physical limitations have plateaued in effectiveness.  The DB Arms brake uses patent pending technology to drastically increase the usable energy in the propellant gasses.  Our first prototypes has doubled the effectiveness of industry leading brakes.  With a little time and funding we can develop a product that potentially eliminates recoil in small arms."

"Energy storage developed directly on a copper wiresThe Cable Based Super Capacitor (CSC) can simultaneously store and transport electricity on a copper wire by using nano-whiskers (hair like structures) that can be grown chemically. This is a simple nanotechnology that has the potential for continuous mass production thus making the CSC one of the lightest, most affordable, and high performance options for energy storage.  The CSC can be used to help commercialize emerging technologies (such as advanced warfare products) as well as provides economic advantages the case of electric/hybrid vehicles and renewable energy sources.   For military, the CSC can reduce the amount of battery weight a solider carries increasing their agility, performance, and self-sufficiency. For wind turbines the CSC can combine the copper wires used for distribution and the capacitors used to filter the source. This not only reduces the BOM and shipping costs but also better distributes heat through the turbine's tower. "

"Singapore – Ahead of the Singapore Defence Technology Summit, the U.S. Department of Defense’s (DOD) Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC) and Singapore’s Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) held a multi-day technology exchange to promote collaboration around Artificial Intelligence (AI), focusing on humanitarian assistance / disaster relief (HA/DR)."
"The Asia-Pacific is prone to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, tropical cyclones, flooding, landslides, and volcanic eruptions that affect millions of people every year. Responses to these disasters often involve many organizations and multiple countries. These missions challenge the community to advance the state of AI and learn how to operationalize and integrate technologies across international organizations. With AI-enabled HA/DR, the first responders and rescuers can better serve in those disaster-affected areas. "
"This partnership between JAIC and DSTA will foster the use of AI capabilities to enhance defense operations as well as help save lives and livelihood by reducing search and discovery timeframes, enabling more informed and timely resourcing decisions. In turn, more effective rescue and relief operations can be conducted during times of crisis when every moment counts."
"This collaboration is the first step for the two organizations to share ideas and knowledge in an effort to push new, innovative AI-enabled applications."
"While the exchange focused primarily on HA/DR, the two organizations also discussed possible future partnerships between the United States and Singapore to use AI in a variety of other areas of mutual interest."

"Today President Donald J. Trump sent Congress a proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 budget request of $716 billion for national security, $686 billion of which is for the Department of Defense.  The National Defense Strategy, which aligns with the National Security Strategy, connects strategy to the FY 2019 budget priorities, enabling the Department to compete, deter, and win.  This establishes a foundation for rebuilding the U.S. military into a more capable, lethal, and ready Joint Force.   The objectives of the Department are “to be prepared to defend the homeland, remain the preeminent military power in the world, ensure the balances of power remain in our favor, and advance an international order that is most conducive to our security and prosperity.”  The FY 2019 budget has been developed to meet these specific objectives."
"Secretary Mattis recently said, “In a world awash in change, with increasing threats, there is no room for complacency.  Failure to implement or fund the 2018 National Defense Strategy will leave us with a force that could dominate the last war, yet be irrelevant to tomorrow's security.  For too long we have asked our military to carry on stoically with a success-at-any-cost attitude.”  We are grateful to Congress and the American people for the recently-enacted Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which lifts the caps so our military can be resourced at a funding level commensurate with our mission."
"The National Security Strategy states that the United States “must reverse recent decisions to reduce the size of the Joint Force and grow the force while modernizing and ensuring readiness.”  The FY 2019 budget increases end strength by 25,900 (24,100 in the active components and 1,800 in the reserve components) over the FY 2018 budget.  Each military service has a distinctive readiness recovery plan and the increases are targeted to advance these plans to improve readiness and increase lethality."
"As the National Defense Strategy notes, “investments will prioritize ground, air, sea and space forces that can deploy, survive, operate, maneuver, and regenerate in all domains while under attack.”  This budget’s major warfighting investments include: "
   Aircraft
   Shipbuilding
   Ground Systems
"The National Defense Strategy also notes the importance of prioritizing “investments in resilience, reconstitution, and operations to assure our space capabilities.”  Our space investments include:"
"Highlighting the importance of missile defense programs, the National Defense Strategy calls for investments that will “focus on layered missile defenses and disruptive capabilities for both theater missile threats and North Korean ballistic missile threats.”  Those investments for FY 2019 include:"
"In addition, the National Defense Strategy calls for a Joint Force that “must be able to strike diverse targets inside adversary air and missile defense networks to destroy mobile power-projection platforms.”  To help accomplish that goal, the FY 2019 budget includes the following preferred munitions:"
"The budget implements the commitment in the National Defense Strategy to “modernize the nuclear triad – including nuclear command, control, and communications, and supporting infrastructure.”  FY 2019 investments in nuclear deterrence include:"
"President Trump’s National Security Strategy articulates that “a growing and innovative economy allows the United States to maintain the world’s most powerful military and protect our homeland.” This budget request invests $13.7 billion in science and technology to further innovation and new and advanced capabilities including hypersonics technology, cyber space, space, directed energy, electronic warfare, unmanned systems and artificial intelligence."
"The FY 2019 budget supports our service members and their families, providing a competitive compensation package that reflects the unique demands and sacrifices of military service.  As the National Defense Strategy highlights, “The creativity and talent of the American warfighter is our greatest enduring strength, and one we do not take for granted.”  The budget:"
o   Spousal/community support
o   Child care for approximately 1 million military children
"o   DoD Dependent Schools, which are educating over 78,000 students"
o   Commissary operations at 237 stores
o   Counseling support for service members and their families 
"This budget increases facilities investment to $10.5 billion, which is 7% above the FY 2018 base budget request.  It concentrates on ensuring the basing infrastructure is sized to increase force lethality and minimizing the cost of maintaining unneeded capacity.  The budget balances investment in infrastructure across DoD priorities and includes:"
"The FY 2019 budget continues to implement the Administration’s commitment to reform DoD business practices for greater performance and affordability.  Highlighting this commitment, the National Defense Strategy cautions that “we must transition to a culture of performance where results and accountability matter.”  Secretary Mattis has directed Deputy Secretary Shanahan to reform DoD’s business operations and reapply those savings to improve readiness and to increase the lethality and capacity of the military.  The DoD is focused on spending wisely by using shared, centralized services with the goal of using best practices to maximize effectiveness in areas including:"
The FY 2019 Budget also reflects continued savings from ongoing reforms such as defense travel modernization and the 25% management headquarters reduction.  Recent DoD reforms include:
"The OCO budget for FY 2019 supports Operation FREEDOM’S SENTINEL in Afghanistan, and Operation INHERENT RESOLVE in Iraq and Syria."

I. PURPOSE OF THIS TESTIMONY
"Chairman Cochran, Vice Chairman Durbin, Members of the Committee:  Thank you for inviting me here today, and for your steadfast support for the men and women of the Department of Defense (DoD), military and civilian alike, who serve and defend our country all over the world.  I’m pleased to be here with Chairman Dunford to discuss President Obama’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 budget submission for the Defense Department."
"At this time last year, we were all facing the bleak prospect of looming budget sequestration, and the damage its return would do to our people and our mission.  I’m grateful that our country’s leaders were able to come together last fall to avert that dismal future, and reach a budget deal that – after several years of fiscal turmoil and reductions – has allowed for greater investment in all our elements of national security and strength.  That was what I urged since becoming Secretary of Defense, including in last year’s budget testimony before this committee, and given the threat environment we face around the world, forging that deal was the responsible thing to do.  It allows our military personnel and their families to know their future more than just one year at a time, which they deserve.  It lets our defense industry partners be more efficient and cutting edge, as we need them to be.  And, perhaps most importantly, it sends a signal to the world – to friends and potential foes alike – of our nation’s strength and resolve."
"The President’s budget submission accordingly adheres to that budget deal – requesting a total of $582.7 billion for the Defense Department in FY 2017, for both the base budget and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds combined.  How we plan to invest those funds, along with our planned investments for the next five years – as detailed in the customary Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) that’s included in the President’s budget submission – are critical to DoD’s ability to carry out our mission of national defense with the excellence the American people expect of their military, which is today the finest fighting force the world has ever known."
"As you know, no one got everything they wanted in the budget deal – I said last year that we needed to rise above our differences, and I’m glad many members of Congress were able to do that – so in budgeting and programming for FY 2017, we had to make responsible choices.  The President’s budget submission reflects those choices, and we need your support for them.  This is particularly true for prudent and necessary reforms – some of which the Congress has long denied, in spite of the cost to both DoD and to America’s taxpayers.  Indeed, while DoD is grateful to this and the other defense committees for your support for the budget deal, it is also the defense committees that in recent years have been tying our hands on reform, as I will address later in this testimony."
"We should remember, however, that the budget deal only covered two years.  Unless Congress addresses the years beyond it and heads off sequestration, DoD will face $100 billion in cuts from 2018 to 2021, which would introduce unacceptable risks.  So Washington will need to come together once again – not unlike last year, and two years before that – to provide stability and protect our national security."
"That’s important, because in this budget submission, we’re taking the long view.  We have to, because even as we must fight and win today’s fights, we must also be prepared to deter and if necessary fight and win the fights that might come 10, 20, or 30 years down the road.  Last fall’s budget deal set the size of our budget, and with this degree of certainty we focused on changing its shape in fundamental ways – making choices and tradeoffs to adjust to a new strategic era, and seize opportunities for the future."
II. A STRATEGIC TURNING POINT FOR THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT
"Let me now describe the strategic assessment that drove our budget decisions.  First of all, it’s evident that America is still today the world’s foremost leader, partner, and underwriter of stability and security in every region across the globe, as we have been since the end of World War II.  As we fulfill this enduring role, it’s also evident that we’re entering a new strategic era."
"Context is important here.  A few years ago, following over a decade when we were focused on large-scale counterinsurgency operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, DoD began embarking on a major strategy shift to sustain our lead in full-spectrum warfighting.  While the basic elements of our resulting defense strategy remain valid, it’s also been abundantly clear to me over the last year that the world has not stood still since then – the emergence of ISIL, and the resurgence of Russia, being just the most prominent examples."
"This is reflective of a broader strategic transition underway, not unlike those we’ve seen in history following major wars.  Today’s security environment is dramatically different – and more diverse and complex in the scope of its challenges – than the one we’ve been engaged with for the last 25 years, and it requires new ways of thinking and new ways of acting."
"Accordingly, five evolving challenges are now driving the focus of DoD’s planning and budgeting."
"Two of these challenges reflect a recognition of – return to, in some ways – great power competition.  This is something we haven’t seen for some time, and that requires heightened focus given its potential impact on our nation and the world.  The first such challenge is in Europe, where we’re taking a strong and balanced approach to deter Russian aggression – we haven’t had to devote a significant portion of our defense investment to this possibility for 25 years, and while I wish it were otherwise, now we do.  The second is in the Asia-Pacific, where we haven’t faced great power competition since the end of World War II, and where China is rising, which is fine, but behaving aggressively, which is not.  There, we’re continuing our rebalance, in terms of weight of effort, to maintain the regional stability we’ve underwritten for the past 70 years, allowing so many nations to rise and prosper in this, the single most consequential region for America’s future."
"Meanwhile, two other longstanding challenges pose threats in specific regions.  One is North Korea, which remains dangerous to both us and our allies – that’s why our forces on the Korean Peninsula remain ready, as they say, to “fight tonight.”  The other is Iran – because while the nuclear accord is a good deal for preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and doesn’t limit DoD in any way, we must still deter Iranian aggression and counter Iran’s malign influence against our friends and allies in the region, especially Israel, to whom we maintain an unwavering and unbreakable commitment."
"Challenge number five, no less important than the other four, is our ongoing fight to counter terrorism, and especially defeat ISIL – most immediately in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, and also where it is metastasizing, in Afghanistan, Africa, and elsewhere – at the same time as we’re protecting our homeland.  While ISIL must and will be defeated now, in the longer perspective and in our budgeting we must also take into account that as destructive power of greater and greater magnitude falls into the hands of smaller and smaller groups of people, countering terrorists will be a continuing part of the future responsibilities of DoD and other national security leaders."
"DoD must and will address all five of these challenges as part of its mission to defend this country.  Doing so requires some new investments on our part, new posture in some regions, and also new and enhanced capabilities.  "
"Key to our approach is being able to deter the most advanced adversaries while continuing to fight terrorist groups.  This means we must have – and be seen to have – the ability to impose unacceptable costs on an advanced aggressor that will either dissuade them from taking provocative action, or make them deeply regret it if they do.  To be clear, the U.S. military will be ready to fight very differently than we have in Iraq and Afghanistan, or in the rest of the world’s recent memory.  We will be prepared for a high-end enemy – what we call full-spectrum.  In our budget, our plans, our capabilities, and our actions, we must demonstrate to potential foes that if they start a war, we are able to win, on our terms.  Because a force meant to deter conflict can only succeed in deterrence if it can show that it will dominate a conflict."
"We have this ability with respect to North Korean and Iranian military forces, as well as in executing the military aspects of countering terrorists, as we’re doing now against ISIL.  That won’t change, even as we know that military power alone cannot prevail without capable and motivated local forces to sustain ISIL’s defeat – nor can the United States alone deliver a lasting defeat – against the toxic ideology of terrorists like ISIL that have so little regard for the lives of fellow human beings."
"In this context, Russia and China are our most stressing competitors, as they’ve both developed and are continuing to advance military systems that threaten our advantages in specific areas, and in some cases, they’re developing weapons and ways of war that seek to achieve their objectives in ways they hope would preempt a response by the United States.  Because of these facts, because the implications of any great-power conflict would be so dire for the United States and the world, and because of those nations’ actions to date – from Ukraine to the South China Sea – DoD has elevated their importance in our defense planning and budgeting to ensure we maintain our advantages in the future."
"While we do not desire conflict with any of these nations – and, to be clear, though they pose some similar defense challenges, they are very different nations and situations – we also cannot blind ourselves to the actions they choose to pursue.  That is the responsible course of action for the Defense Department.  Our military is first and foremost a warfighting force, and even as we seek to deter wars, we must also be prepared to fight and win them, which is itself a key part of deterrence."
"Our military must be balanced with the proper size and capability to defeat any attack against U.S. forces and our allies.  And because of the decisions in this budget, our military will be better prepared for both present and future challenges, and better positioned to deter, and if necessary fight and win, wars against even the most high-end of potential adversaries."
"As this budget addresses those five evolving challenges, it also seizes great opportunities – in supporting new and innovative operational concepts; in pioneering and dominating technological frontiers, including undersea, cyber, space, electronic warfare, and other advanced capabilities; in reforming the defense enterprise; and in building the force of the future.  I will address the investments we’re making to do so later in this testimony."
III. SUPPORTING THE STRENGTH AND WELLNESS OF TODAY’S FIGHTING FORCE
"Before I address how this budget ensures we meet those challenges and seize those opportunities, I want to first emphasize our enduring commitment to supporting the men, women, and families of the world’s finest fighting force.  Above all, this means exercising the utmost care in decisions involving the deployment and employment of our troops.  It also requires devoting a significant share of our budget every year toward supporting the people, military and civilian alike, who execute DoD’s missions around the world."
"To ensure we have a force that’s ready to carry out today’s missions, this budget invests in the four main things that every soldier, sailor, airman, and Marine needs to do their job – the right training; the right equipment; the right force size, meaning the right number of people alongside them; and the right compensation."
The Right Training
"In FY 2017 and beyond, the budget makes critical investments in training throughout the force to rebuild toward full-spectrum combat readiness and continue recovering from the damage caused by sequestration in recent years – though, it’s important to remember that restoring readiness requires not only sufficient funding, but also time.  The budget maximizes use of the Army’s decisive action Combat Training Centers, funding 19 total Army brigade-level training rotations.  It provides robust funding to sustain the Navy and Marine Corps’ current training levels and readiness recovery plans for FY 2017 – optimizing Navy training while maximizing the availability of naval forces for global operations, and fully funding the Marine Corps’ integrated combined arms exercises for all elements of its Marine Air-Ground Task Forces.  And, because recent operational demands like the fight against ISIL have slowed the Air Force’s return to full-spectrum readiness, the budget increases funding – as part of a $1 billion increase over the FYDP to support Air Force readiness – to modernize and expand existing Air Force training ranges and exercises here at home, providing pilots and airmen with more realistic training opportunities when they’re not deployed."
The Right Equipment
"The budget also makes important investments to provide our men and women in uniform with functioning, well-maintained equipment so that when we send them into the fights of today, they’re able to accomplish their mission and come home safely.  For example, to address the Navy and Marine Corps’ growing maintenance backlog in tactical aviation, the budget funds a 15 percent increase in F-18 depot maintenance capacity, and it buys an additional 16 F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet fighter jets between now and FY 2018 – providing a significant boost to the health of the Navy and Marine Corps’ 4th-generation fighter aircraft fleet so it’s ready and capable for today’s missions.  To help ensure the Air Force has enough ready and capable aircraft for both combat missions and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), the budget funds improvements in the avionics and electronic warfare systems of legacy fighter and bomber aircraft, and it supports the Air Force’s ‘get well plan’ for remotely-piloted aircraft."
"The budget also makes critical investments in every domain to research, develop, test, evaluate, and procure the right technology and equipment our military will need to deter and if necessary fight and win full-spectrum conflicts in the future.  I will detail those investments later in this testimony."
The Right Force Size
"The flexibility provided by last fall’s budget deal allowed us to maintain DoD’s desired targets across the FYDP for end-strength and active-reserve mix for our ground forces – without it, sequestration likely would have forced further reductions.  Therefore, the budget stabilizes our total ground force end-strength by the end of FY 2018 with an Army of 450,000 active-duty soldiers, 335,000 soldiers in the Army National Guard, and 195,000 soldiers in the Army Reserve – comprising 56 total Army brigade combat teams and associated enablers – and a Marine Corps of 182,000 active-duty Marines and 38,500 Marine reservists.  For the Navy, the budget continues to grow the size, and importantly the capability, of the battle fleet – providing for 380,900 active-duty and reserve sailors in FY 2017, and an increase from 280 ships at the end of FY 2016 to 308 ships at the end of the FYDP.  The budget also supports an Air Force of 491,700 active-duty, reserve, and National Guard airmen – maintaining 55 tactical fighter squadrons over the next five years, and providing sufficient manpower to address high operating tempo and shortfalls in maintenance specialists for both tactical fighters and remotely-piloted aircraft."
The Right Compensation
"In FY 2017, the budget provides $177.9 billion in pay and benefits – including health care, housing allowances, commissaries, retirement, and other benefits – for DoD’s 2.1 million military personnel and their families.  I will discuss DoD’s proposed reforms to some of these areas later in this testimony.  To help make sure DoD is competitive for the best talent, the budget includes a department-wide pay raise of 1.6 percent in FY 2017.  This is an increase above FY 2016’s pay raise of 1.3 percent."
"It’s important to note that of all the cuts we’ve taken to our previously-planned budgets since the Budget Control Act was passed, including cuts from sequestration – altogether so far totaling at least $800 billion over ten years – less than 9 percent of those reductions came from military compensation proposals.  This should make clear that we’ve worked extremely hard to protect our people, and that we do need to address some places where savings can be found, such as through modernizing and simplifying our military healthcare system, which I address later in this testimony."
More Than Military Readiness
"Beyond ensuring the combat readiness of America’s military, our commitment to the force of today also encompasses what we’re doing to ensure the dignity of our people.  We’re putting a priority on preventing and eliminating sexual harassment and sexual assault in the military, investing $246 million in FY 2017 to help support survivors, reduce retaliation for reporting, and eradicate these crimes from our ranks – and soon, DoD will deliver to Congress our strategy on addressing retaliation, in particular.  We’re also helping provide transition support and advocating for employment opportunities for veterans, investing a total of $109 million in FY 2017 so our people can make the most of their potential and keep making a difference when they complete their service in uniform.  And we’re fostering greater diversity of our force, because our strength depends on being open to the widest possible pool of talent that can meet our standards – young Americans today are more diverse, open, and tolerant than past generations, and if we’re going to attract the best among them to contribute to our mission, we ourselves have to be more diverse, open, and tolerant, too.  It’s the only way to compete in the 21st century."
"That’s one reason why we’re opening all remaining combat positions to women, so that we have access to 100 percent of our population for every position in the all-volunteer force and every American who can meet our exacting standards has the full and equal opportunity to contribute to our mission.  That said, since the declaration that opens all career fields to women is by itself not sufficient for their full integration, I’ve asked the military services to mitigate any concerns about combat effectiveness by incorporating my seven guiding principles – transparent standards, population size, talent management, physical demands and physiological differences, operating abroad, conduct and culture, and assessment and adjustment – into their implementation plans, which I have reviewed and approved and are now being carried out.  First and foremost, this means the services will continue to apply objective standards for all career fields to ensure leaders assign tasks and career fields throughout the force based on ability, not gender.  This may mean in some cases, equal opportunity may not always equate to equal participation.  Integration provides equal opportunity for men and women who can perform the tasks required; it does not guarantee women will fill these roles in any specific number or at any set rate, as adherence to a merit-based system must continue to be paramount.  Also, we must incorporate concrete ways to mitigate the potential for higher injury rates among women, and leverage lessons learned from Iraq and Afghanistan to address concerns regarding operating in areas where there is cultural resistance to working with women.  We must address attitudes toward team performance through education and training, including making clear that sexual assault or harassment, hazing, and unprofessional behaviors are never acceptable.  Our core beliefs in good order, discipline, leadership, and accountability are foundational to our success in integration.  And it is absolutely critical that we embark on integration with a commitment to the monitoring, assessment, and in-stride adjustment that enables sustainable success."
"Finally, it’s important to remember that our commitment to the force of today is not limited to those who serve in uniform.  In FY 2017, it also includes $79.3 billion to support our civilian workforce of 718,000 Americans – men and women across the country and around the world who do critical jobs like helping repair our ships and airplanes, providing logistics support, developing and acquiring weapon systems, supporting survivors of sexual assault, and helping care for our military’s wounded, ill, and injured personnel.  The budget includes $7.7 billion to support our military families, because they serve too.  It includes $3.1 billion to help take care of our wounded warriors, to whom our commitment is and must remain as strong as ever.  And it includes our enduring pledge to support the families of the fallen, whose loved ones made the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of our country."
IV. ADJUSTING TO STRATEGIC CHANGE
"Another significant portion of our budget goes toward DoD’s current operations all around the world, in every domain, to help defend our country, our allies, and our interests.  Our budget’s investments and programming decisions in this area reflect my commitment to helping the President address key national security challenges, and my priorities for how we must adjust to strategic change – in countering terrorists, whether ISIL, al-Qaeda, or others; in taking a strong and balanced approach to deter Russian aggression; in operationalizing our rebalance to the Asia-Pacific; in deterring Iranian aggression and malign influence; in standing alert on the Korean Peninsula; and in addressing threats from multiple directions in cyber, space, and electronic warfare.  We don’t have the luxury of choosing between these challenges; we must and will address them all, and not only be prepared across the spectrum of conflict, but also for the possibility of multiple conflicts in overlapping timeframes."
Countering Terrorism
"It is clear that our mission of countering terrorists and other violent extremists around the world will be with us for some time.  The Department of Defense has strong counterterrorism capabilities, and we continue to deploy them to protect America."
Dealing ISIL a Lasting Defeat
"We must and will deal ISIL a lasting defeat, which is why the budget provides $7.5 billion in FY 2017 for Operation Inherent Resolve.  This investment will be critical to continuing to implement and accelerate the coalition military campaign plan that the United States has developed, that our key allies support, and that focuses on three military objectives:  One, destroy the ISIL parent tumor in Iraq and Syria by attacking its two power centers in Mosul, Iraq and Raqqa, Syria; these cities constitute ISIL’s military, political, economic and ideological centers of gravity, which is why our plan has big arrows pointing toward both.  Two, combat the emerging metastases of the ISIL tumor worldwide wherever they appear.  And three, our most important mission, which is to protect the homeland."
"To eliminate the parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, DoD is enabling local, motivated forces with critical support from a global coalition wielding a suite of capabilities-ranging from airstrikes, special forces, cyber tools, intelligence, equipment, mobility and logistics, training, advice and assistance.  It must be local forces who deliver ISIL a lasting defeat, because only they can secure and govern the territory by building long-term trust within the populations they liberate.  We can and will enable such local forces, but we cannot substitute for them.  Accordingly, the budget’s investment in the counter-ISIL campaign includes $630 million for training and equipping the Iraqi Security Forces, and $250 million for enabling Syrian anti-ISIL forces."
"This is a worthy investment, as we’ve already started to see our investments over the last several months start to pay off.  For example, it was Iraqi soldiers who took back Ramadi, reversing a loss the Iraqi army suffered last spring.  Our support to them included advanced training, tactics, air support, and the portable bridges that carried the Iraqi military across the Euphrates River and into the decisive fight.  Ramadi, like recent Iraqi gains in Bayji, Tikrit, and Sinjar, demonstrates that the approach we are taking is having an effect as Iraqis prepare for what will be a tough fight for Mosul.  Likewise in Syria, local anti-ISIL forces we’ve enabled with equipment and ammunition have had successes in Tal Abyad, al-Hawl, the Tishreen Dam, and Shaddadi.  It is imperative to keep building on this momentum."
"As we work with our partners to destroy ISIL’s parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, we must also recognize that ISIL is metastasizing in areas like North and West Africa and Afghanistan.  Having taken out ISIL’s leader in Libya in November, we are also now prepared to step up pressure on ISIL in Afghanistan to check their ambitions there as well."
"Finally, at the same time that we accelerate our campaign, so must every one of our coalition partners – there can be no free riders.  That’s why in Brussels this February I convened the first-ever meeting of defense ministers from 27 other countries involved in the military coalition to defeat ISIL to follow up after I personally reached out to dozens of defense ministers to urge them to consider filling critical military and non-military needs in the campaign.  And I’m gratified to report that coalition members responded to our challenge – and not only NATO allies like Canada and the Netherlands, but also Gulf nations, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.  In sum, nearly 90 percent of the countries participating in the coalition’s military campaign have either stepped up their role or committed to do so in the coming days.  Their decisions to expand air operations, send more trainers, provide logistical support, help with reconstruction, or make other contributions will all help our coalition intensify the counter-ISIL campaign and bring about ISIL’s lasting defeat."
"None of this changes the fact that our counter-ISIL campaign is a hard and complex fight.  We have tactical and strategic goals, but they will take time – and, as is often said, the enemy gets a vote.  For our part, we will remain focused, committed, and resilient because this is a fight we can, must, and will win, as our efforts to accelerate our campaign are already producing real and promising results."
Ensuring Long-Term Stability in Afghanistan
"After more than a decade of war in Afghanistan, we have to make sure our gains there stick, which is why the budget continues to support our two missions in Afghanistan – countering terrorism, and training, advising, and assisting the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF).  In support of those two missions, the President announced last fall that the United States will maintain a continued presence of 9,800 troops through most of 2016 before drawing down to 5,500 troops by January 2017.  As I told our troops there when I visited them this past December, while Afghanistan remains a dynamic fight, we are determined to ensure that terrorists – regardless of whether they’re al-Qaeda or ISIL – never have or find safe haven there again."
"The budget provides $41.7 billion in FY 2017 for Operation Freedom’s Sentinel – including funding to support our posture in U.S. Central Command, the full funding of $3.4 billion to support the ANDSF, and $1.4 billion to support other coalition partners.  Importantly, this allows us to continue strengthening and developing the ANDSF’s aviation, logistics, intelligence, and special operations capabilities, with the intent of reducing their dependency on us over time.  Also, in addition to upholding our commitments to Afghanistan, the Afghan people, and other partners, the budget reflects that the United States will retain several key locations in 2016 and beyond, including facilities in Kabul, Bagram, Jalalabad, and Kandahar.  As we do so, the United States will support the continuation of the NATO mission in Afghanistan in 2016 and beyond, and continue to consult with our NATO allies and partners to ensure that the U.S. and NATO missions in Afghanistan are mutually supportive."
"Our continued presence in Afghanistan is not only a sensible investment to counter threats that exist and stay ahead of those that could emerge in this volatile region; it also supports the willing partner we have in the government of Afghanistan.  It is in the United States’ interest to help them succeed, for the benefit of their security, our security, the region and the world."
Establishing an Alternative to the Detention Facility at Guantanamo 
"The Defense Department is resolutely committed to responsibly closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay through the establishment of an alternative detention facility.  I share the President’s belief – and the belief of many in Congress – that doing so would benefit our national security, which is why DoD will continue to transfer Guantanamo detainees to other countries when we have substantially mitigated any security risks to the United States."
"Over the last five months, we completed transfers for 27 detainees, bringing the population to 80.  Like every transfer that came before them, the decision to transfer these detainees happened only after a thorough review by me and other senior security officials of our government."
"That said, because many of the remaining detainees currently cannot be safely transferred to another country, we need an alternative to this detention facility.  Therefore, I support the President’s plan to establish and bring those detainees to an appropriate, secure, alternative location in the United States.  I appreciate that Congress has indicated a willingness to consider such a proposal, and, in accordance with the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, DoD delivered that plan to Congress in February.  We look forward to working with Congress to identify the most appropriate design, legislative foundation, and geographic location for future detention and to lift the restrictions preventing the responsible closure of the facility at Guantanamo."
Supporting and Maintaining our Counterterrorism Capabilities
"In addition to the specific funds outlined above, the budget also reflects other investments we’re making in DoD’s posture to ensure we can counter terrorism effectively wherever it challenges us.  For example, the budget sustains our robust funding for U.S. Special Operations Command, allocating $10.8 billion in FY 2017.  To bolster our partners in fighting terrorism, it requests $1 billion for our Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund.  And it supports the development of DoD’s transregional counterterrorism strategy, which I’d like to outline now."
"The terrorist threat is continually evolving, changing focus, and shifting location, requiring us to be flexible, nimble, and far-reaching in our response.  Accordingly, the Defense Department is leveraging the existing security infrastructure we’ve already established in Afghanistan, the Middle East, East Africa, and Southern Europe, so that we can counter transnational and transregional terrorist threats like ISIL and others in a sustainable, durable way going forward.  From the troops I visited in Morón, Spain last October to those I visited in Jalalabad, Afghanistan last December, these locations and associated forces in various regions help keep us postured to respond to a range of crises, terrorist and other kinds.  In a practical sense, they enable our crisis response operations, counter-terror operations, and strikes on high-value targets, and they help us act decisively to prevent terrorist group affiliates from becoming as great of a threat as the main entities themselves.  This transregional approach is already giving us the opportunity and capability to react swiftly to incidents and threats wherever they occur, and it maximizes our opportunities to eliminate targets and leadership.  An example of this in action was our November strike on Abu Nabil, ISIL’s leader in Libya, where assets from several locations converged to successfully kill him.  To help implement this strategy, including in the fight against ISIL and its metastasis beyond Iraq and Syria, the budget includes an additional $175 million in FY 2017 – $9 million to help bolster our posture in the Levant, and $166 million to help us better address threats in North and West Africa in conjunction with our European partners."
"Because the accelerating intensity of our precision air campaign against ISIL in Iraq and Syria has been depleting our stocks of some of the GPS-guided smart bombs and laser-guided rockets we use against terrorists the most, the budget invests $1.8 billion in FY 2017 to buy over 45,000 more of them.  Furthermore, DoD is also exploring increasing the production rate of these munitions in our industrial base – calling on America’s great arsenal of democracy to help us and our partners finish the job of defeating ISIL."
"Also, because our remotely-piloted intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft play an important role in countering terrorism, the budget includes $1.2 billion for FY 2017 and $4.5 billion over the FYDP to increase the number of around-the-clock permissive ISR combat air patrols from 70 today to 90 by the end of FY 2018.  Using a mix of MQ-9 Reapers, Extended Range Reapers, and MQ-1C Advanced Gray Eagles – and comprising 60 patrols from the Air Force, 16 from the Army, and 14 that are government-owned and flown by contractors for the Air Force and U.S. Special Operations Command – these investments will be critical as the need for ISR continues to increase around the world."
"Finally, because it helps us maintain a larger Air Force fighter fleet that can drop more smart bombs in our counter-ISIL air campaign, the budget also further defers the A-10 Thunderbolt’s final retirement until 2022.  I saw some of the A-10s that are flying bombing missions against ISIL when I was at Incirlik Air Base in Turkey last December, and we need the additional payload capacity they can bring to the fight.  Accordingly, we are also changing the rate at which we will phase out the A-10 as we approach 2022, as I will explain later in this testimony."
A Strong and Balanced Strategic Approach to Deter Russia
"Despite the progress we’ve made together since the end of the Cold War, Russia has in recent years appeared intent to erode the principled international order that has served us, our friends and allies, the international community, and also Russia itself so well for so long.  In Europe, Russia continues to violate the sovereignty of Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova, and actively seeks to intimidate its Baltic neighbors.  In Syria, Russia has been pouring gasoline on a civil war, fueling the very extremism Russia claims to oppose.  At sea, in the air, in space, and in cyberspace, Russian actors have engaged in challenging international norms.  And most disturbing, Moscow’s nuclear saber-rattling raises questions about Russia’s leaders’ commitment to strategic stability, their respect for norms against the use of nuclear weapons, and whether they respect the profound caution that nuclear-age leaders showed with regard to brandishing nuclear weapons."
"To be clear, the United States does not seek a cold, let alone hot war with Russia.  We do not seek to make Russia an enemy, even as it may view us that way.  But make no mistake – we will defend our interests, our allies, the principled international order, and the positive future it affords us all.  That’s why the United States is taking a strong and balanced strategic approach in response to Russia’s aggression:  strengthening both our allies and ourselves, including through investments in this budget, while also giving Russia the opportunity, if it chooses, to rejoin the international community and work with us where our interests align."
"Since Russia began its illegal attempted annexation of Crimea a little over two years ago, DoD’s budgets have made valuable investments in reinforcing our NATO allies; for example, contributing to NATO’s Very High Readiness Joint Task Force, and stepping up our training and exercises under Operation Atlantic Resolve.  This budget builds on that significantly, and breaks new ground by re-envisioning and recommitting to deterring – and, if deterrence fails, defeating – any aggression against our allies in the future.  The 20th century NATO playbook was successful in working toward a Europe whole, free and at peace, but the same playbook would not be well-matched to the needs of the 21st century.  Together with our NATO allies, we must write a new playbook, which includes preparing to counter new challenges like cyber and hybrid warfare, better integrating conventional and nuclear deterrence, as well as adjusting our posture and presence to adapt and respond to new challenges and new threats."
"To further reinforce our NATO allies and build our deterrence posture in the face of Russia’s aggression, this budget significantly increases funding for our European Reassurance Initiative to make a total investment of $3.4 billion for FY 2017 – more than quadrupling the $789 million that we requested last year – allowing us to increase the amount of prepositioned equipment sets in Europe as well as the number of U.S. forces, including Reserve forces, rotating through Europe to engage with friends and allies.  This increase supports the persistent rotational presence of an armored brigade combat team for 12 months out of the year, which will give us a total of three brigade combat teams continuously present in Europe.  It supports more training and exercises with our European friends and allies.  It supports more warfighting gear, including forward-stationing equipment for an additional armored brigade combat team by the end of 2017.  It supports prepositioning equipment for a division headquarters and other enablers in Europe, such that this equipment – along with assigned Army airborne and Stryker brigade combat teams and Marine Corps heavy vehicles and equipment already in Europe – will allow us to rapidly form a highly-capable combined-arms ground force of division-plus strength that can respond theater-wide if necessary.  And it helps strengthen our regional air superiority posture – among other things, allowing us to keep an additional F-15C tactical fighter squadron based in Europe, and also improve airfield infrastructure to enhance operations for Air Force fighters and Navy maritime patrol aircraft."
"In addition, the budget reflects how we’re doing more, and in more ways, with specific NATO allies.  Given increased Russian submarine activity in the North Atlantic, this includes building toward a continuous arc of highly-capable maritime patrol aircraft operating over the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom gap up to Norway’s North Cape.  It also includes the delivery of Europe’s first stealthy F-35 Joint Strike Fighters to our British allies.  And, given Russia’s use of hybrid warfare – exemplified by the so-called ‘little green men’ in Ukraine – the budget supports more rotational presence of U.S. special operations forces exercising in Europe."
"The budget also significantly funds important new technologies that, when coupled with revised operational concepts, will ensure we can deter and if necessary win a high-end conventional fight in an anti-access, area-denial environment across all domains and warfighting areas – air, land, sea, space, cyberspace, and the electromagnetic spectrum.  While I will address these areas in greater detail later in this posture statement, investments that are most relevant to deterring Russia include new unmanned systems, enhanced ground-based air and missile defenses, new long-range anti-ship weapons, the long-range strike bomber, and also innovation in technologies like the electromagnetic railgun, lasers, and new systems for electronic warfare, space, and cyberspace.  The budget also invests in modernizing our nuclear deterrent."
"Consistent with our strong and balanced approach, the door will remain open for Russia to reassume the role of respected partner going forward.  While that would be greatly welcomed by the United States, and the Department of Defense, it’s up to the Kremlin to decide – first by demonstrating a willingness to return to the international community."
Operationalizing the Rebalance to the Asia-Pacific
"The budget also supports operationalizing our rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region.  In a region home to nearly half the world’s population and nearly half the global economy, for 70 years the United States has helped underwrite a stable security environment that allowed the people, economies, and countries in the Asia-Pacific to rise and prosper.  We fully intend to continue these efforts so that bright future can be possible for everyone in this important region."
"Accordingly, the budget helps improve DoD’s geographically distributed, operationally resilient, and politically sustainable posture in the region, through which the United States seeks to preserve peace and stability, and maintain our strategic advantage in an area that’s critically important to America’s political, economic, and security interests.  Investments in the budget reflect how we’re moving more of our forces to the region – such as 60 percent of our Navy and overseas Air Force assets – and also some of our most advanced capabilities in and around the region, from F-22 stealth fighter jets and other advanced tactical strike aircraft, to P-8A Poseidon maritime surveillance aircraft, to our newest surface warfare ships.  They also reflect how we’re developing and implementing new posture initiatives – in places like Guam, the Northern Marianas, the Philippines, Australia, and Singapore, as well as modernizing our existing footprint in Korea and Japan – and continuing to strengthen existing partnerships and develop new ones, from India to Vietnam.  And they reflect our efforts to support and strengthen a regional security architecture that benefits everyone – from strengthening and modernizing our alliances, to bolstering our ties with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), to building the security capabilities of our many friends and allies, who increasingly want to do more with us in the region.  In support of this effort, the budget fully supports our five-year, $425 million Southeast Asia Maritime Security Initiative begun in FY 2016."
"For this region, as it does with Europe, the budget also significantly funds important new technologies to ensure we can deter and if necessary win a high-end conventional fight in an anti-access, area-denial environment across all domains and warfighting areas – air, land, sea, space, cyberspace, and the electromagnetic spectrum.  These investments – which I will outline later in this testimony – are important for ensuring our forces can go anywhere, at any time, and succeed in whatever mission we ask of them."
"It’s important to remember that America’s rebalance has never aimed to hold any nation back or push any country down. The United States wants every nation to have an opportunity to rise, because it’s good for the region and good for our collective interests.  That includes China.  As we welcome the growth and prosperity of all Asia-Pacific nations, it is clear that the U.S.-China relationship will be complex as we continue to balance our competition and cooperation.  There are opportunities to improve understanding and to reduce risk with China – for example, we’ve agreed to four confidence-building agreements, including one meant to prevent dangerous air-to-air encounters.  But there remain areas of concern."
"For one, the United States joins virtually everyone else in the region in being deeply concerned about the pace and scope of land reclamation in the South China Sea, the prospect of further militarization, as well as the potential for these activities to increase the risk of miscalculation or conflict among claimant states.  U.S. military presence in the region is decades-old, has been instrumental in upholding the rules-based international system, and has laid the foundation for peace and security in the region.  Our interest is in maintaining freedom of navigation and overflight, full and unimpeded lawful commerce, and that disputes are resolved peacefully.  To accomplish this, we will continue to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows.  We also expect China to uphold President Xi’s pledge not to pursue militarization in the Spratly Islands of the South China Sea."
"Also, we are closely watching the long-term, comprehensive military modernization program that China, as well as other countries, continues to pursue.  While there is no question that the United States retains a decisive military edge in the Asia-Pacific today, China is investing in capabilities to counter third-party – including the United States – intervention during a crisis or conflict.  These capabilities include ballistic and cruise missiles of increasingly greater range and accuracy, counter-space and offensive cyber capabilities, and electronic warfare systems.  To maintain a lasting competitive advantage, DoD is taking prudent steps to preserve and enhance deterrence for the long term.  The budget reflects this, including with investments to continue adapting our forces, posture, operations, and capabilities to deter aggression, defend our allies, and sustain our military edge in the Asia-Pacific."
Deterring North Korea
"The budget also supports investments necessary to deter North Korean provocation and aggression, ensure our forces on the Korean Peninsula remain ready and capable to ‘fight tonight’ if necessary, and defend against threats emanating from North Korea against the United States and our allies.  This includes threats posed by North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs, against which DoD is fully capable of defending the U.S. homeland.  Our position has been, and remains, that North Korea must abide by its international obligation to abandon its nuclear and missile programs and stop its provocative behavior."
North Korea’s nuclear test on January 6th and its ballistic missile launch on February 7th were highly provocative acts that undermine peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in the region.  The United States condemns these violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions and again calls on North Korea to abide by its international obligations and commitments.  We are monitoring and continuing to assess the situation in close coordination with our regional partners.
"DoD remains fully capable of fulfilling U.S. treaty commitments to our allies in the event of a North Korean attack, and we’re working with our Republic of Korea allies to develop a comprehensive set of alliance capabilities to counter the growing North Korean ballistic missile threat.  I spoke with my South Korean counterpart shortly after the nuclear test, and reiterated our commitments as strong and steadfast allies.  Also, a few hours after the ballistic missile launch, the United States and the Republic of Korea jointly announced the start of formal consultations to discuss the feasibility of deploying a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system to the Korean Peninsula at the earliest date."
Checking Iran’s Malign Influence while Strengthening Regional Friends and Allies
"The Middle East presents a kaleidoscope of challenges, but there, as everywhere, DoD’s budget – and accordingly our actions and strong military posture – is guided by our North Star of what’s in America’s interests.  Defeating ISIL in Iraq and Syria, which I discussed earlier, is of course one of those interests, but amid this region’s complexity and uncertainty, we also have other interests of great importance, which are to deter aggression; to bolster the security of our friends and allies, especially Israel; to ensure freedom of navigation in the Gulf; and to check Iran’s malign influence even as we monitor the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.  That’s why DoD maintains tens of thousands of American personnel ashore and afloat in the region, along with our most sophisticated ground, maritime, and air and ballistic missile defense assets."
"While the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action places significant limitations on Iran that will effectively cut off its pathways to the fissile material for a nuclear bomb, it does not limit in any way what DoD can and will do to pursue our defense strategy in the region.  It places no limits on our forces, our partnerships and alliances, our intensive and ongoing security cooperation, or on our development and fielding of new military capabilities – capabilities we will continue to advance in order to provide all options, as the President has directed, should Iran walk away from its commitments under this deal.  So if Iran were to commit aggression, our robust force posture ensures we can immediately respond and rapidly surge an overwhelming array of forces into the region, leveraging our most advanced capabilities married with sophisticated munitions that put no target out of reach."
"This budget invests in maintaining those abilities going forward, which is important, because Iran and its proxies will still present security challenges.  Iran supports Assad in Syria, backs Hezbollah in Lebanon, and is contributing to disorder in Yemen, while still directing hostility and violence to our closest ally in the region, Israel.  To continue to meet our commitments and enhance our cooperation with our friends and allies in the region, especially Israel, the budget makes critical investments – including $146 million to support Israel in FY 2017.  This reflects our unshakeable commitment to Israel and its security, with funding for Iron Dome, David’s Sling, Arrow, and other cooperative defense programs – not only ensuring that Israel can defend itself, but also preserving and enhancing Israel’s qualitative military edge, which is a cornerstone of our defense relationship."
"Meanwhile, with critical investments in other areas, the budget enables DoD to continue to advance our preparations, posture, partnerships, and planning to preserve the President’s options for any contingency.  It strengthens the regional security architecture in a way that blunts Iran’s ability to coerce its neighbors.  And it helps us stay ahead of the risks posed by Iran’s ballistic missiles, naval forces, cyber capabilities, and support for terrorists and others in the region."
"Addressing Threats in Cyber, Space, and Electronic Warfare "
"Even as we make adjustments in our budget to address the five evolving challenges posed by Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, and terrorist groups like ISIL and al-Qaeda, we are also making adjustments to address emerging and increasing threats that transcend individual nations and organizations.  That’s because, as we confront these five challenges, we know we’ll have to deal with them across all domains – and not just the usual air, land, and sea, but also particularly in the areas of cyber, space, and electronic warfare, where our reliance on technology has given us great strengths, but also led to vulnerabilities that potential adversaries are eager to exploit."
"As I made clear when I released DoD’s new cyber strategy last April, we have three missions in cyberspace – first and foremost, to defend our networks, systems, and information; second, to help defend the nation and our interests from cyberattacks of significant consequence, working with other departments and branches of government; and third, to provide options that can augment our other military systems.  Given the increasing severity and sophistication of the threats and challenges we’re seeing in cyberspace – ranging from ISIL’s pervasive online presence to the data breaches at the Office of Personnel Management – the budget puts a priority on funding our cyber strategy, investing a total of $6.7 billion in FY 2017 and $34.6 billion over the FYDP.  This is a $900 million increase over last year’s budget.  While these funds will help us continue to develop, train, and equip our growing Cyber Mission Force, and also make new technological investments to strengthen our cyber defenses and capabilities – both of which I address later in this testimony – the budget also reflects our efforts to make a fundamental shift toward a culture of accountability in cyberspace, from instituting a DoD-wide cybersecurity scorecard to monitor our progress to increasing individual knowledge about practical ways to defend against cyber intrusions.  Our people understandably hold themselves to very high standards when it comes to caring for, attending to, using, and being accountable for the weapons they carry into battle, and we must do the same when it comes to interacting with our networks and cyber capabilities – not only among our cyber warriors and IT professionals, but throughout the DoD workforce."
"While at times in the past space was seen as a sanctuary, new and emerging threats make clear that’s not the case anymore, and we must be prepared for the possibility of a conflict that extends into space.  This means that as we continue to ensure our access to space so we can provide capabilities like reconnaissance, GPS, and secure communications that enable and enhance our operations in other domains, we must also focus on assuring and defending these capabilities against aggressive and comprehensive counter-space programs of others.  Though competitors may understand our reliance on space, we will not let them use it against us, or take it away.  As I will discuss later in this testimony, this budget makes important investments to do just that – sustaining and building on the major shifts DoD began funding in last year’s budget submission – with a total of more than $22 billion for space in FY 2017.  With the presence of so many commercial space endeavors, we want this domain to be just like the oceans and the Internet:  free and open to all."
"Finally, high-end competitors have also invested in electronic warfare systems as a cost-effective way to challenge the United States and try to blunt our technological advantage.  By jamming our radars, communications, and GPS, these systems would seek to disrupt the integrated capabilities that allow our forces to identify, target, reach, and destroy an enemy with precision.  We cannot allow that to happen, which is why this budget deliberately invests in buying more electronic protection and resiliency for our current systems as well as developing more advanced capabilities.  I will address these investments in more detail later in this testimony."
V. SEIZING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE FUTURE
"The other significant share of our budget goes toward making sure DoD will be ready for the future.  Our budget’s investments and programming decisions in this area reflect my commitment to create a Defense Department that’s open to change and new ideas to ensure a better future for both DoD and the nation, and my priorities in doing so.  These are best understood through the four key pillars of this commitment – namely, updating and refining warfighting strategies, operational concepts, and tactics; driving smart and essential technological innovation; building the force of the future; and reforming the DoD enterprise."
"While I will describe what we’re doing in each of those areas momentarily, the dynamic strategic environment I described earlier in this testimony explains why such change is so important – not for the sake of change, but for the security of this country.  We cannot let those challenges overtake us; we have to stay ahead of them and stay the best.  That’s why as Secretary of Defense I’ve been pushing the Pentagon to think outside our five-sided box."
"Updating and Refining Warfighting Strategies, Operational Concepts, and Tactics"
"Because our military has to have the agility and ability to win both the fights we’re in, the wars that could happen today, and the wars that could happen in the future, we’re always updating our plans and developing new operational approaches to account for any changes in potential adversary threats and capabilities, and to make sure that the plans apply innovation to our operational approaches – including ways to overcome emerging threats to our security, such as cyberattacks, anti-satellite weapons, and anti-access, area denial systems.  We’re building in modularity that gives our chain of command’s most senior decision-makers a greater variety of choices.  We’re making sure planners think about what happens if they have to execute their plan at the same time as another contingency is taking place, so they don’t fall into the trap of presuming the contingency they’re planning for would be the only thing we’d be doing in the world at that time.  And we’re injecting agility and flexibility into our processes, because the world, its challenges, and our potential opponents are not monolithic, and we must be just as dynamic to stay ahead of them."
"As I mentioned earlier, DoD is continuing to embark on a force-wide, all-service transition from an era focused on counterinsurgency operations to an era focused on the full spectrum of military operations.  While we do so for many important reasons, it’s also important to note that we don’t want to forget or turn our back on counterinsurgency, but rather enable most of our forces to be capable of doing a lot more than just that.  A smaller segment of our force will still specialize in these skills, and DoD will retain the ability to expand our operational capacity for counterinsurgency missions should it become necessary."
"The transition to full-spectrum operations is and will be coupled with demonstrations to clearly signal it and make that signal credible, which is key to conventional deterrence.  The same is true for our investments in capabilities – in new technologies, new operational concepts, and also innovative ways for how we use what we already have – these must and will be demonstrated as well.  This is accounted for in the budget, as are other investments we’re making to recommit ourselves to deterrence across the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of conflict."
"Recognizing the immense value that wargaming has historically had in strengthening our force in times of strategic, operational, and technological transition – such as during the interwar years between World War I and World War II, when air, land, and naval wargamers developed innovative approaches in areas like tank warfare and carrier aviation – this budget makes significant new investments to reinvigorate and expand wargaming efforts across the Defense Department.  With a total of $55 million in FY 2017 as part of $526 million over the FYDP, this will allow us to try out nascent operational concepts and test new capabilities that may create operational dilemmas and impose unexpected costs on potential adversaries.  The results of future wargames will be integrated into DoD’s new wargaming repository, which was recently established to help our planners and leaders better understand and shape how we use wargames while also allowing us to share the insights we gain across the defense enterprise."
Driving Smart and Essential Technological Innovation
"The investments this budget makes in technology and innovation, and the bridges it helps build and rebuild, are critical to staying ahead of future threats in a changing world.  When I began my career, most technology of consequence originated in America, and much of that was sponsored by the government, especially DoD.  Today, not only is much more technology commercial, but the competition is global, with other countries trying to catch up with the advances we’ve enjoyed for decades in areas like precision-guided munitions, stealth, cyber, and space.  So now, as we have in the past, DoD must invest to ensure America pioneers and dominates these and other technological frontiers."
"DoD is therefore pursuing new technology development along with new operational concepts, and new organizational constructs – all of which are reflected in or supported by this budget submission – to maintain our military’s technological superiority and ensure we always have an operational advantage over any potential adversary.  How we do this is important, because while the Cold War arms race was characterized mostly by strength, with the leader simply having more, bigger, or better weapons, this era of technological competition is uniquely characterized by an additional variable of speed, such that leading the race now depends on who can out-innovate faster than everyone else.  It’s no longer just a matter of what we buy; what also matters is how we buy things, how quickly we buy them, whom we buy them from, and how quickly and creatively we’re able to upgrade them and repurpose them to be used in different and innovative ways to stay ahead of future threats."
"In particular, this means leveraging the capability of current and emerging technologies, including commercial technologies wherever appropriate.  It means demonstrating and seeding investments in new capabilities and concepts to counter advanced anti-access, area-denial challenges across all domains and in every region where they persist – a particular focus of DoD’s effort to develop a third offset strategy.  And also, it means investing in and operationalizing our security by leveraging advances in cyber, space, electronic warfare, biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and other areas.  Our technologies and capabilities must be able to operate so that no matter what any of our enemies might throw at them, they are able to defeat attempts to be hacked."
"Accordingly, this budget invests a total of $183.9 billion in FY 2017, and $951 billion over the FYDP, to help research, develop, test, evaluate, and procure the right technology and capabilities our military will need to deter and if necessary fight and win full-spectrum conflicts in the future.  For the second year in a row, the budget increases funding for our research and development accounts, which total $71.8 billion in FY 2017.  That includes $12.5 billion specifically invested in science and technology to support groundbreaking work happening in the military services, in our dozens of DoD labs and engineering centers across the country, and in the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to develop and advance disruptive technologies and capabilities in areas like undersea systems, hypersonics, electronic warfare, big data analytics, advanced materials, energy and propulsion, robotics, autonomy, and advanced sensing and computing."
"At the same time that DoD is making investments in technologies themselves, we’re also investing in building and rebuilding bridges with America’s vibrant, innovative technology community and forging more connections with the commercial technology base – and it’s reflected in our budget.  In FY 2017, this includes $45 million for our Defense Innovation Unit-Experimental (DIUx), which we opened in Silicon Valley last August to build relationships and better tap into the region’s innovation ecosystem.  It also includes $40 million for our pilot program with the independent, non-profit startup backer In-Q-Tel, leveraging its venture capital model to help find innovative solutions for some of our most challenging problems.  And it includes $137 million to support our public-private partnership-funded Manufacturing Innovation Institutes, including the one focused on flexible hybrid electronics that I announced in Silicon Valley last August.  In all these areas, similar to how DoD’s historic investments in things like GPS and the Internet later went on to yield great benefits for not just our security but also our society, we hope the investments we’re making in some of these fields along with our partners in the technology industry will lead to incredible advances that today we can only imagine."
"Importantly, technological innovation must be done in concert with operational innovation.  It’s not enough to have or create new technologies or weapon systems; how they are used is key.  The budget reflects work DoD has been undertaking in this area though multiple lines of effort.  First, there’s our Long-Range Research and Development Planning Program – an effort named after the mid-1970s project that brought together a cross-section of military, academic, and private-sector experts who paved the way to a future of GPS-guided smart bombs, battle networks, and stealth – and also our Advanced Capability and Deterrence Panel.  Both focus on identifying and charting longer-term, leap-ahead investments for strategies and capabilities that will give us an advantage several decades from now, and together they make up nearly 60 percent of our science and technology investments in this budget submission."
"Now, to focus on maintaining our near-term advantage, DoD has an office that we don’t often talk about, but that I want to highlight today.  It’s called the Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO).  I created SCO in 2012 when I was Deputy Secretary of Defense to reimagine existing DoD, intelligence community, and commercial systems by giving them new roles and game-changing capabilities to confound potential opponents.  I picked a talented physicist to lead it.  SCO is incredibly innovative, but also has the rare virtue of rapid development and the even rarer charter to keep current capabilities viable for as long as possible.  So it’s good for both troops and taxpayers alike."
"SCO is focused on thinking differently, which is incredibly important to innovation when it comes to technological capabilities.  Thinking differently put us in space and on the moon.  It put computers in our pockets and information at our fingertips.  It’s how we came to have airplanes that take off from the decks of ships, nuclear submarines beneath the seas, and satellite networks that take pictures of the world and show us where we are in it.  And this kind of bold, innovative thinking isn’t lost to history.  It’s happening every day, in SCO and many other places throughout the Department of Defense."
"Most people don’t often hear about it because most of its work is classified; however, SCO has been a tremendously useful part of DoD.  It’s received large support from all the services, as well as our combatant commands, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the intelligence community, and also Congress – with its budget growing from $140 million in its first year, FY 2014, to reaching $845 million for FY 2017 in this year’s budget submission.  To show the return we’re getting on those investments, I’d like to highlight some projects SCO has been working on that we’re funding in the budget."
"First is a project focused on advanced navigation, where SCO is taking the same kinds of micro-cameras and sensors that are littered throughout our smartphones today, and putting them on our Small Diameter Bombs to augment their targeting capabilities.  This will eventually be a modular kit that will work with many other payloads – enabling off-network targeting through commercial components that are small enough to hold in your hand."
"Another SCO project uses swarming, autonomous vehicles in all sorts of ways, and in multiple domains.  For the air, they’ve developed micro-drones that are really fast, and really resilient – they can fly through heavy winds and be kicked out the back of a fighter jet moving at Mach 0.9, like they did during an operational exercise in Alaska last year, or they can be thrown into the air by a soldier in the middle of the Iraqi desert.  And for the water, they’ve developed self-driving boats, which can network together to do all sorts of missions, from fleet defense to close-in surveillance – including around an island, real or artificial, without putting our sailors at risk.  Each one leverages the wider world of technology.  For example, the micro-drones use a lot of commercial components and 3D printing.  And the boats build on some of the same artificial intelligence algorithms that NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory wrote for the Mars lander."
"SCO also has a project on gun-based missile defense, where we’re taking the same hypervelocity smart projectile developed for the electromagnetic railgun, and using it for point defense by firing it with artillery we already have in our inventory – including the five-inch guns at the front of every Navy destroyer, and also the hundreds of Army Paladin self-propelled howitzers.  This way, instead of spending more money on more expensive interceptors, we can turn past offense into future defense – defeating incoming missile raids at much lower cost per round, and thereby imposing higher costs on the attacker.  In fact, we tested the first shots of the hypervelocity projectile out of a Paladin earlier this year, and we found that it also significantly increases the range."
"There’s also a SCO project that we’re calling the arsenal plane, which takes one of our oldest aircraft platforms, and turns it into a flying launch pad for all sorts of different conventional payloads.  In practice, the arsenal plane will function as a very large airborne magazine, networked to fifth-generation aircraft that act as forward sensor and targeting nodes – essentially combining different systems already in our inventory to create wholly new capabilities."
"The last SCO project I want to highlight is how we’re creating a brand new capability with the SM-6 missile, an interceptor that’s designed to launch from our Navy’s surface ships and be highly maneuverable and aerodynamic to stop incoming ballistic and cruise missiles in the atmosphere.  It’s one of our most modern and capable munitions – and thanks to work done by SCO, we’ve been able to modify the SM-6 so that in addition to missile defense, it can also target enemy ships at sea.  This new anti-ship mode makes the SM-6 doubly useful, taking the defensive speed and maneuverability already sitting in our Aegis destroyers’ launch cells and leveraging it for offensive surface warfare lethality.  That makes it a potent new capability for our fleet, and also a good deal for the taxpayer by using the same thing twice.  We already know this works; it was fully tested this past January to great success.  And, as I will address later in this testimony, this new operational concept is strongly reflected in our 2017 budget."
"Those are just a few projects that SCO has worked on so far – and they’re working on a lot more, including some surprising ones."
"Now, with all of that in mind – from why we need to invest in technological innovation, to how we’re doing it – let me address the specific investments this budget makes in technologies and capabilities to deter, and if necessary fight and win, a full-spectrum conventional war against even the most high-end of adversaries.  In concert, they will help maintain our military’s edge both under and on the sea, on land, in the air, in space, in cyber and electronic warfare, and in the modernization and maintenance of our nuclear enterprise."
Maritime Investments
"In the maritime domain, the budget refocuses our Navy on building lethality for high-end conflicts while continuing to grow the battle fleet to meet, but not exceed, the department’s warfighting posture requirement of 308 ships.  Our investments reflect an emphasis on payloads over platforms, on the ability to strike from sanctuary quickly so that no target is out of reach, and on closing capability shortfalls that have developed over the last several years."
"First, the budget maximizes our undersea advantage – leveraging and growing our commanding lead in an area where the U.S. military should be doing more, not less, going forward.  It provides funding for important payloads and munitions, including $170.8 million in FY 2017 and $1.5 billion over the FYDP for an improved heavyweight torpedo as well as research and development for an advanced lightweight torpedo to stay ahead of existing and emerging undersea challenges.  It includes $5.2 billion in FY 2017 and $29.4 billion over the FYDP to buy nine Virginia-class attack submarines over the next five years; four of those submarines – up from three in last year’s budget – will be equipped with the versatile Virginia Payload Module that can more than triple each submarine’s strike capacity from 12 Tomahawk land attack missiles to 40.  The budget also invests $500 million in FY 2017, and $3.4 billion over the FYDP, to upgrade 49 of our submarines’ combat systems and enhance underwater acoustics on nine of our existing Virginia-class submarines.  It increases funding for unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs) by over $100 million in FY 2017, part of a total $173 million in FY 2017 and $1.2 billion over the FYDP that invests in, among other areas, rapid prototyping of UUVs in multiple sizes and diverse payloads – which is important, since UUVs can operate in shallow waters where manned submarines cannot.  And it includes $2.2 billion in FY 2017 and $6.4 billion over the FYDP to continue procuring the advanced P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol and surveillance aircraft.   Together, all these investments – totaling $8.2 billion in FY 2017, and $41.9 billion over the next five years – will ensure we continue to have the most lethal undersea and anti-submarine force in the world."
"Second, the budget makes significant investments to bolster the lethality of our surface fleet forces, so they can deter and if necessary prevail in a full-spectrum conflict against even the most advanced adversaries.  It invests $597 million in FY 2017, and $2.9 billion over the FYDP, to maximize production of the SM-6 missile, one of our most modern and capable munitions, procuring 125 in FY 2017 and 625 over the next five years – and this investment is doubly important given the SM-6’s new anti-ship capability.  It also invests in developing and acquiring several other key munitions and payloads – including $1 billion in FY 2017, and $5.8 billion over the FYDP, for all variants of the SM-3 high-altitude ballistic missile interceptor; $340 million in FY 2017, and $925 million over the FYDP, for the Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile; $221 million in FY 2017, and $1.4 billion over the FYDP, for the Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile, including its extended range version; and $435 million in FY 2017, as part of $2.1 billion over the FYDP, for the most advanced variant of the Tactical Tomahawk land-attack missile, which once upgraded can also be used for maritime strike."
"Third, the budget reflects decisions we’ve made to ensure that we look at our overall warfighting posture, rather than only the presence that contributes to it, in determining whether our maritime forces can deter and if necessary fight and win a full-spectrum conflict.  Having grown the size and the capability of our surface and subsurface fleet over the last seven years, this budget will continue to do both.  It will ensure we meet the department’s 308-ship posture requirement – indeed, growing the battle fleet to 308 ships by the end of the FYDP – and it will make our naval forces as a whole more capable, more survivable, and more lethal than they would have been otherwise."
"The budget invests $3.4 billion in FY 2017 and $18.3 billion over the FYDP to continue to buy two DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers each year over the next five years – a total of 10 over the FYDP – as well as $400 million in FY 2017 and $2.8 billion over the FYDP for modernizing our destroyers, 12 of which will also receive upgrades to their combat systems.  It continues to support 11 carrier strike groups, investing $2.7 billion in FY 2017 and $13.5 billion over the FYDP for new construction of Ford-class carriers, as well as $2 billion in FY 2017 and $8.9 billion over the FYDP for midlife reactor refueling and overhauls on our current carrier fleet.  And, as I will discuss in the reform section of this testimony, it supports modernizing our guided missile cruisers – providing them with more capability and a longer lifespan while freeing up significant funds that can be put toward a variety of uses."
"I’d like to now address the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), where we made an important tradeoff so we could put more money in submarines, Navy fighter jets, and many other critical areas.  As such, the budget takes a new approach to the LCS and its associated frigate – buying a total of 40, not the 52 or more that were planned starting back in 2002.  Let me explain why.  First, to be clear, we’re investing in LCS and frigates because we need the capability they provide, and for missions like minesweeping and anti-submarine warfare, they’re expected to be very capable.  But now, in 2016, we have to further balance our shipbuilding investments among guided missile destroyers and Virginia-class attack submarines.  We face competitors who are challenging us on the open ocean with new submarines, ships, aircraft, and missiles – advanced capabilities we haven’t had to contend with in a long time, meaning that we must now invest more in higher-end capabilities across our own fleet.  The department’s warfighting analysis called for 40 small surface combatants, so that’s how many we’re buying.  Over the next 10 years, this will let us invest almost $8 billion more into highly lethal ships and capabilities – all the while increasing both the number of ships and the capability of our battle fleet.  While this will somewhat reduce the number of LCS available for presence operations, that need will be met by higher-end ships, and it will ensure that the warfighting forces in our submarine, surface, and aviation fleets have the necessary capabilities to defeat even our most advanced potential adversaries.  Under this rebalanced plan, we will still achieve our 308-ship goal within the next five years, and we will be better positioned as a force to effectively deter, and if necessary defeat, even the most advanced potential adversaries."
Land Investments
"To ensure our ground forces have the capabilities to counter emerging threats and the demonstrated ability to deter and if necessary fight and win a full-spectrum conflict, the budget will help provide our Army, Marine Corps, and special operations forces with greater lethality in several forms.  This includes a next-generation shoulder-launched weapon, a life extension program as well as a replacement for the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) that can be used for improved counter-battery and long-range strike, and increased firepower for Stryker armored fighting vehicles.  Together these investments comprise $780 million in FY 2017 and $3.6 billion over the FYDP."
"Additionally, the budget invests $735 million in FY 2017, and $6.8 billion over the FYDP, in the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle intended to replace the military’s Humvees – procuring more than 2,000 vehicles in FY 2017, and a total of more than 17,700 vehicles over the next five years.  It also invests $159 million in FY 2017, and $1.7 billion over the FYDP, in the Amphibious Combat Vehicle, which will replace the Marine Corps’ aging Amphibious Assault Vehicle – helping procure over 200 vehicles over the next five years.  And, as I discuss later in the reform section of this testimony, it supports the Army’s ongoing Aviation Restructure Initiative – investing $1.1 billion for 52 AH-64 Apache attack helicopters in FY 2017, and $5.7 billion for 275 Apaches over the FYDP, as well as $1 billion for 36 UH-60 Black Hawk utility helicopters in FY 2017, and $5.6 billion for 268 Black Hawks over the FYDP."
"The budget also invests $9.1 billion for missile defense in FY 2017, and $47.1 billion over the FYDP.  This reflects important decisions we’ve made to strengthen and improve our missile defense capabilities – particularly to counter the anti-access, area-denial challenge of increasingly precise and increasingly long-range ballistic and cruise missiles being fielded by several nations in multiple regions of the world.  Instead of spending more money on a smaller number of more traditional and expensive interceptors, we’re funding a wide range of defensive capabilities that can defeat incoming missile raids at much lower cost per round, and thereby impose higher costs on the attacker.  The budget invests in improvements that complicate enemy targeting, harden our bases, and leverage gun-based point defense capabilities – from upgrading the Land-Based Phalanx Weapons System, to developing hypervelocity smart projectiles that as I mentioned earlier can be fired not only from the five-inch guns at the front of every Navy destroyer, but also the hundreds of Army M109 Paladin self-propelled howitzers.  Additionally, the budget’s missile defense investments maintain DoD’s commitment to improving our homeland and theater defense systems – as we’re increasing the number of deployed Ground-Based Interceptors (GBIs) from 30 to 44, redesigning the exo-atmospheric kill vehicle to improve the reliability of the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system, and funding improvements and follow-on concept development for the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system.  Specifically, we’re investing $1.2 billion in FY 2017 and $5.8 billion over the FYDP for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense program; for THAAD, we’re spending $640 million in FY 2017 and $3.6 billion over the FYDP, which includes procuring 24 interceptors in FY 2017 and 149 over the FYDP; and, to research, develop, and deploy a new Long-Range Discrimination Radar, we’re investing $317 million in FY 2017 and $1 billion over the FYDP."
Air Investments
"To ensure the U.S. military’s continued air superiority and global reach, the budget makes important investments in several areas – and not just platforms, but also payloads.  For example, it invests $2.4 billion in FY 2017 and $8 billion over the FYDP in a wide range of versatile munitions – including buying more Small Diameter Bombs, JDAMs, Hellfires, and AIM-120D air-to-air missiles.  We are also developing hypersonics that can fly over five times the speed of sound."
"The budget continues to buy the stealthy, fifth-generation F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter.  It includes $10.1 billion in FY 2017 and $56.3 billion over the FYDP to procure a total of 404 F-35s across the force through 2021 – 43 F-35As for the Air Force in FY 2017 as part of 243 to be purchased over the FYDP, 16 F-35Bs for the Marine Corps in FY 2017 as part of 97 to be purchased over the FYDP, and 4 F-35Cs for the Navy and Marine Corps in FY 2017 as part of 64 to be purchased over the FYDP.  This represents a slight deferral in Air Force F-35 procurement, which we’re doing in order to free up funds to maintain a larger-size Air Force of 55 tactical fighter squadrons, and to improve avionics, radar, and electronic warfare systems in legacy bomber and fighter aircraft like the F-15, F-16, B-1, B-2, and B-52 fleets – increasing their lethality, survivability, and therefore usefulness in a full-spectrum conflict.  At the same time, it also represents an increase in the Navy and Marine Corps’ F-35 procurement, which is important to ensure sufficient high-end capability and numbers in our aircraft carriers’ tactical fighter fleet."
"Additionally, the budget invests $1.4 billion in FY 2017 and $12.1 billion over the FYDP for continued development of the B-21 Long-Range Strike Bomber, as well as $3.1 billion in FY 2017 and $15.7 billion over the FYDP to continue upgrading our aerial tanker fleet – buying 15 KC-46A Pegasus refueling tankers in FY 2017 as part of 75 aircraft to be purchased over the FYDP."
"The budget also reflects important decisions regarding future unmanned aerial systems, such as the Navy’s Carrier-Based Aerial Refueling System (CBARS), formerly known as the Unmanned Carrier-Launched Air Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) program – by focusing in the near-term on providing carrier-based aerial refueling, we’re setting the stage for a future unmanned carrier air wing.  With this approach, the Navy will be able to quickly and affordably field the kinds of unmanned systems that its carrier air wings need today, while laying an important foundation for future, more capable unmanned carrier-based platforms.  We know we need to ensure aircraft can operate off the carrier in high-threat environments, and we’re working hard to make them unmanned – it’s just that the UCLASS program as previously structured was not the fastest path to get us there.  This approach will allow us to get started integrating unmanned aircraft onto our aircraft carriers affordably and as soon as possible."
"Furthermore, to maximize the capabilities and extend the reach of all our airborne systems, the budget reflects how we’re expanding manned-unmanned teaming – from buying Navy MQ-4C Triton unmanned maritime surveillance and patrol aircraft, which can be paired with our P-8A Poseidon aircraft for a variety of missions; to buying Army AH-64 Apache attack helicopters that can pair with MQ-1C Gray Eagle scouts; to buying Air Force F-35s that can network with both payloads and platforms."
Cyber and Electronic Warfare Investments
"This budget significantly increases our cyber capabilities, with new investments totaling over $900 million in FY 2017 compared to last year’s budget."
"Because defending our networks is and must be DoD’s number-one mission in cyberspace, the budget makes significant investments to improve our defensive capabilities to deny a potential attack from succeeding.  These include $336 million over the FYDP to support more capable network perimeter defenses, as well as $378 million over the FYDP to train and strengthen DoD’s Cyber Protection Teams to respond to security breaches, grow our cyber training and testing ranges, and support tool development that will let our Cyber Mission Force quickly respond to cyberattacks against our networks regardless of where they are stationed around the world."
"Reflecting our renewed commitment to deterring even the most advanced adversaries, the budget also invests in cyber deterrence capabilities, including building potential military response options.  This effort is focused on our most active cyber aggressors, and is based around core principles of resiliency, denial, and response."
As part of DoD’s second cyber mission – defending the nation – the budget invests in an advanced capability to disrupt cyberattacks of significant consequences.  And to support DoD’s third cyber mission – providing offensive cyber options that if directed can augment our other military systems – the budget invests $347 million over the FYDP to help provide cyber tools and support infrastructure for the Cyber Mission Force and U.S. Cyber Command.
"DoD has a unique level of resources and cyber expertise compared to the rest of the federal government, and following the recent data breaches of the Office of Personnel Management’s information technology systems, DoD has undertaken responsibility for the development, maintenance, and cybersecurity of the replacement background investigation systems and their data infrastructure.  To provide proper support and a dedicated funding stream for this effort, the President’s budget includes $95 million for DoD in FY 2017.  Also, on a separate but related note, the budget invests $454 million over the FYDP to ensure DoD will continue to have access to the trusted microelectronic components needed in our weapon systems.  By developing alternative sources for advanced microchips and trusted designs, this funding will help ensure the long-term security of our systems and capabilities."
"Meanwhile, to protect our platforms and ensure U.S. freedom of maneuver in contested environments, the budget also continues to support research, development, testing, evaluation, and procurement of advanced electronic warfare capabilities – totaling $3.7 billion in FY 2017 and $20.5 billion over the FYDP.  To enhance the electronic survivability and lethality of fighter and bomber aircraft like the F/A-18, F-15, and B-2, we’re investing in both offensive and defensive airborne capabilities, including the Air Force’s Defensive Management System modernization and Eagle Passive Active Warning Survivability System, and also the Navy’s Integrated Defensive Electronic Countermeasures and Next Generation Jammer.  We’re upgrading the radar on our E-3 Sentry AWACS with enhanced electronic protection to make adversary jammers less effective.  Investments in the Navy’s Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program will help our ships protect themselves better.  And to help protect our ground forces, the budget invests in the Army’s Common Infrared Countermeasures and Electronic Warfare Planning and Management Tool, as well as the Marine Corps’ Intrepid Tiger pod."
"While cyber and electronic warfare capabilities provide, for the most part, different techniques to achieve similar mission objectives, an integrated approach can yield additional benefits.  This is reflected in our budget, including investments intended to ensure we can hold even the most challenging targets at risk."
Space Investments
"As I mentioned earlier, this budget continues and builds upon important investments in last year’s budget to help secure U.S. access to space and address space as an operational domain."
"After adding over $5 billion in new investments in DoD’s 2016 budget submission to make us better postured for contested military operations in space – including over $2 billion in space control efforts to address potential threats to U.S. space systems – this budget largely sustains those investments over the FYDP.  While there is much more work ahead, we are on a good path in our efforts to complicate an adversary’s ability to defeat our systems while also enhancing our ability to identify, attribute, and negate all threatening actions in space."
"Meanwhile, the budget also supports strengthening our current space-based capabilities, and maturing our space command and control.  It invests in more satellites for our Space-Based Infrared System to maintain the robust strategic missile warning capability we have today.  And it allocates $108 million over the FYDP to implement the Joint Interagency Combined Space Operations Center (JICSpOC), which will better align joint operations in space across the U.S. government."
"DoD must have assured access to space through multiple reliable sources that can launch our critical national security satellites, which is why the budget invests $1.8 billion for space launch in FY 2017 and $9.4 billion over the FYDP.  Because we want to end the use of the foreign RD-180 engine as soon as possible, because we have a strong desire to preserve competition for space launch in order to ensure multiple launch service providers can sustain uninterrupted access to space, and to control costs, the budget includes funds for competitive public-private partnerships to help develop new launch services, which we believe is the most responsible way forward.  Merely developing a new engine would not give us the assured access to space that we require.  We plan to take advantage of the emerging commercial space launch marketplace using an innovative, more commercial approach – investing through competition in new launch services in return for priced options for future launches."
Nuclear Enterprise Investments
"The budget also makes reforms and investments needed to continue providing a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent.  Compared to last year’s budget submission, it adds $10 billion over the next five years, for a total of $19 billion in FY 2017 and $108 billion over the FYDP for maintaining, and modernizing the nuclear force and associated strategic command, control, and communications systems.  This reflects DoD’s continuing commitment to the nuclear triad and its critical mission."
"In addition to making an array of investments across the nuclear enterprise – from increased funding for manpower, equipment, vehicles, and maintenance, to technological efforts that improve the sustainability of our bomber fleet – the budget also fully funds the first stages of our key nuclear modernization effort, in particular the replacement of our Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines.  The Ohio Replacement Program is allocated $1.9 billion in FY 2017 and $13.2 billion over the FYDP, which in addition to research and development will allow the first year of construction on an incrementally-funded first ship to begin in FY 2021."
"We expect the total cost of nuclear modernization to be in the range of $350-$450 billion.  Although this still presents an enormous affordability challenge for DoD, we believe it must be funded.  Previous modernizations of America’s strategic deterrent and nuclear security enterprise were accomplished by topline increases to avoid having to make drastic reductions to conventional forces, and it would be prudent to do so again.  I hope DoD can work with Congress to minimize the risk to our national defense."
Building the All-Volunteer Force of the Future
"While we have the finest fighting force in the world today, that excellence is not a birthright, and we can’t take it for granted in the 21st century.  We have to earn it again and again, starting with our most enduring advantage – our people."
"That’s what building the force of the future is all about:  making sure that long into the future, my successors will be able to count on the same excellence in people that I do today.  And we have several overarching priorities to help us do that, like attracting a new generation of talented Americans, promoting diversity, and rewarding merit; carving tunnels through the walls between DoD, the private sector, our reserve force, and other agencies across the government; and updating and modernizing our personnel management systems with technology and data analysis to help improve the choices and decisions we make related to our people."
"I made this commitment to President Obama when he asked me to serve as Secretary of Defense, and so shortly after I was sworn in, I visited my old high school in Abington, Pennsylvania to outline my vision for the force of the future.  I talked about how, in the face of generational, technological, and labor market changes, we in the Pentagon must try to make ourselves even better at attracting talent from new generations of Americans.  In the months that followed, I went to places like Silicon Valley and St. Louis, and heard from companies like Facebook, Boeing, and LinkedIn about what they’re doing to compete for talent in the 21st century.  And this past December, I announced that we’re opening all combat positions to women, to expand our access to 100 percent of America’s population for our all-volunteer force."
"Throughout this process, we’ve always been mindful that the military is a profession of arms.  It’s not a business.  We’re responsible for defending this country – for providing the security that allows our friends and family members and fellow citizens to go to school, go to work, to live their lives, to dream their dreams, and to give the next generation a better future."
"The key to doing this successfully is leveraging both tradition and change. While the military cannot and should not replicate all aspects of the private sector, we can and should borrow best practices, technologies, and personnel management techniques in commonsense ways that work for us, so that in future generations, we’ll keep attracting people of the same high caliber we have today – people who will meet the same high standards of performance, leadership, ethics, honor, and trust we hold our force to today."
"Last spring I asked DoD’s Personnel and Readiness chief to lead a team in developing a package of bold proposals, which they did – building on the great work the military services were already doing, and also coming up with some new ideas.  Subsequently, a senior leadership team led by Deputy Secretary of Defense Bob Work and Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Paul Selva has been working with the service vice chiefs to closely analyze each proposal and make recommendations before I decide.  While this process is still ongoing for some proposals, I’ve decided to announce my decisions on other proposals as I’ve made them, which I will now detail."
Greater Permeability and Talent Management
"I outlined the first link we’re building to the force of the future at George Washington University last November, announcing over a dozen new initiatives in several categories that are intended to make our future Defense Department better connected to 21st century talent."
"First, we’re creating what we call ‘on-ramps’ for people who aren’t involved with DoD but want to try contributing to our mission.  One way we’re doing this is by having better managed internship programs that more effectively transition promising interns into employees.  Another is our new Defense Digital Service, which brings in talent from America’s vibrant, innovative technology community for a time to help solve some of our most complex problems.  We’re also going to bring in resident entrepreneurs, who will work with senior leaders on challenging projects for a year or two.  And we’re going to hire a chief recruiting officer to bring in top executives for stints in civilian leadership roles, as we had in the past with people like Dave Packard, co-founder of HP, who also served as Deputy Secretary of Defense."
"Second, we’re creating short-term ‘off-ramps’ for those currently in DoD, so they can gain new skills, experiences, and perspectives from outside and then bring them back in to help keep us strong, creative, and forward-thinking.  One way we’re doing this is by expanding and broadening the Secretary of Defense Corporate Fellowship program, including by opening it up to qualified enlisted personnel.  Another example is the Career Intermission Pilot Program, which lets people take a sabbatical from their military service for a few years while they’re getting a degree, or learning a new skill, or starting a family.  DoD plans to seek authorities to make this program permanent, and looks forward to working with Congress to do so – similar to how we were able to partner last year to update and modernize retirement benefits and ensure that the 80 percent of our force that doesn’t serve 20 years will get the benefits they earned whenever they move on to whatever’s next in life."
"And third, we’re going to use 21st century data and technology to improve and modernize our talent management systems.  We’re launching LinkedIn-style pilot programs to help give servicemembers and units more choice in matching up for future assignments.  We’re creating an Office of People Analytics to leverage big data to inform our personnel policies.  We’re finally implementing exit surveys, so we can have quantitative data on why people decide to leave.  And to help us keep bringing in the best people, we’re looking at ways to evaluate recruit performance, improve outcomes, and better analyze trends that if left unchecked could indicate or lead to our military’s insularity from the rest of society."
Family Support and Retention
"Next, in January, I announced our so-called second link to the force of the future, a set of several initiatives with a singular focus: strengthening the support we provide our military families to improve their quality of life.  They were developed keeping in mind DoD’s recruiting, retention, and career and talent management needs, as well as our closely-linked readiness and warfighting demands, which must always guide us."
"We know that our all-volunteer force is predominantly a married force – 52 percent of our enlisted force is married, and 70 percent of our officer force is married.  We also have another 84,000 military-to-military marriages, with 80 percent of them stationed within 100 miles of each other.  So while we recruit a servicemember, we retain a family.  This means that what we do to strengthen quality of life for military families today, and what we do to demonstrate that we’re a family-friendly force to those we want to recruit, is absolutely essential to our future strength.  While we often speak of commitments to family and country in the same breath, the stresses of military service on our families are heavy and well known; among the stresses military families face, having and raising children is near the top.  We also know that at 10 years of service, when women are at their peak years for starting a family, women are retained at a rate 30 percent lower than men across the services.  And we know that a high level of work and family conflict is one of the primary reasons they report leaving service."
"To build the force of the future, tackling these problems is imperative, especially when the generation coming of age today places a higher priority on work-life balance.  These Americans will make up 75 percent of the American workforce by 2025.  Nearly four-in-five of them will have a spouse or a partner also in the workforce – twice the rate of baby boomers.  These Americans wait longer to have children, and when they do have children, they want to protect the dual earning power of their families to provide for their children accordingly."
"That’s why, for starters, we’re providing a more competitive standard for maternity and paternity leave across our joint force – setting 12 weeks of fully paid maternity leave as the standard across the joint force, and working with Congress to seek authorities to increase paid paternity leave for new fathers from 10 to 14 days, which they can use in addition to annual leave.  These changes put DoD in the top tier of institutions nationwide, and will have significant influence on decision making for our military family members.  For both mothers and fathers alike, this establishes the right balance of offering a highly competitive leave policy while also maintaining the readiness of our total force.  While I don’t take lightly that 12 weeks of maternity leave represents a downshift from what the Navy pursued last summer, we will be at the forefront in terms of competition, especially as part of the comprehensive basket of family benefits we’re providing across the joint force.  This will be an increasingly important factor as current and future generations of parents have different views and expectations in parenting, and we must continue to be able to attract and retain the best talent among them."
"Additionally, we’re expanding the childcare we provide on our bases, because whether for single parents, for families in which both parents work outside the home, or for every mother or father in our military, childcare hours should be as responsive as possible to work demands.  So based on feedback from pilot programs, and in the interest of responding to typical work hours at our installations, we will increase childcare access to 14 hours a day across the force.  By providing our troops with childcare they can rely on –from before reveille to after taps – we provide one more reason for them to stay on board.  And we show them that supporting a family and serving our country are by no means incompatible goals."
"We’re also making relatively inexpensive improvements so that our workplaces are more accommodating to women when they return from maternity leave, with a focus on making it easier for them to continue breastfeeding if they choose.  To make the transition between maternity leave and returning to work for military mothers smoother, to enhance our mission effectiveness, and to comply with standards that apply to nearly every organization outside the military, we’re requiring the installation or modification of mothers’ rooms throughout all facilities when there are more than 50 women regularly assigned."
"Furthermore, we can also be more creative about making reasonable accommodations for members of our force who face difficult family geographic situations while at the same time preserving our force’s effectiveness.  Data indicates that allowing family members to trade the ability to remain at a station of choice in exchange for an additional active-duty service obligation is one approach that could increase retention, while preserving readiness.  DoD will be seeking legislative authority to this effect – when the needs of the force permit a servicemember to stay at their current location, we will seek to empower commanders to make reasonable accommodations, in exchange for an additional service obligation."
"Finally, as a profession of arms, we ask our men and women to make incomparable sacrifices.  We ask them, potentially, to place themselves at risk of sacrificing their ability to have children when they return home.  To account for this more fully in the benefits we provide our troops, DoD will cover the cost of freezing sperm or eggs through a pilot program for active-duty servicemembers – a benefit that will help provide our men and women, especially those deployed in combat, with greater peace of mind.  This investment will also provide greater flexibility for our troops who want to start a family, but find it difficult because of where they find themselves in their careers."
"Each of these initiatives is significant in its own right.  Taken together, they will strengthen our competitive position in the battle for top talent, in turn guaranteeing our competitive position against potential adversaries.  The initiatives approved to date total $867 million across the FYDP; we’ve included this in our budget because it’s a worthy investment that will yield great returns."
More Still to Come
"While these first two links are important, we will have more to announce on the force of the future in the coming months.  For example, we’re taking a serious look at some commonsense reforms in our officer promotion system, and I greatly appreciate Congressional leaders from both parties who have indicated their support for such reforms in principle.  We’re also looking at ways to improve how we manage our civilian personnel, working with the government-wide Office of Personnel Management as well as federal employee unions.  In both of these efforts, working with Congress will be essential to ensure that our force of the future is as strong as the force of today."
Reforming the DoD Enterprise
"As I’ve said consistently from the moment I became Secretary of Defense, I cannot ask for more taxpayer dollars for defense without being candid about the fact that not every defense dollar is spent as wisely or responsibly as it could be, and also being determined to change that and make our department more accountable.  That’s why reforming the DoD enterprise is so important – from improving how we’re organized so we can best respond to the challenges and opportunities of the future security environment, to continuing to improve our acquisition and enterprise-wide business and audit practices, to reducing excess infrastructure and overhead, to modernizing the military healthcare system."
"Before I address the reforms in this budget submission, it’s important to consider the recent history of defense reform – how DoD has been embarked on a reform path for much of the last seven years, and how we appreciate Congress’s work with us over the last year on acquisition and modernized retirement reforms."
"Despite what some may think, this administration hasn’t been dragging its feet when it comes to defense reform – the reality has been quite the opposite.  Beginning in 2009, we reduced the number of senior executives and general and flag officers, while working with Congress to trim management headquarters staffs by 20 percent, and move DoD toward auditability.  We’ve done three iterations of the Better Buying Power initiative I established to continuously improve our acquisitions, with Better Buying Power 3.0 incorporated into this budget, and we’re seeing compelling indications of positive improvements, including in areas like reduced cost growth and reduced cycle time.  And we’ve continually submitted much-needed reforms to strengthen the efficiency and capability of our force – many of which have been continually denied, either in whole or in part, at a cost for both taxpayers and our troops.  This last part poses a real problem, because every dollar Congress denies us in reform is a dollar we can’t invest in security we need to deter and defend against today’s and tomorrow’s threats."
"Now is the time for action.  DoD will work closely with Congress on any anticipated reform legislation, and we welcome an open and collaborative process.  In the past, legislative reform has proven to be a double-edged sword – sometimes it leads to constructive change, which is good, but other times it just adds to bureaucracy and overhead, even if that was never the intent.  I hope that with the focus on reform we’ve recently been seeing in this and the other defense committees in Congress, we can work together to do reform right.  And we should, because there’s a lot that needs to be accomplished in many areas."
Continuously Improving Acquisition
"DoD has been, and still is, absolutely committed to improving acquisition outcomes.  After five years of implementing our Better Buying Power (BBP) initiatives for continuous process improvements in the defense acquisition system, we’re seeing compelling indications of significant improvement in acquisition outcomes – for example, annual growth metrics for contracted costs on our major programs have dropped dramatically from a peak of 9.1 percent in 2011 to a 30-year low of 3.5 percent in 2015, and a much higher percentage of major programs are projecting cost reductions relative to initial baselines than in the past.  While these developments are positive signs, we can and must do more to sustain and where possible accelerate our momentum to keep improving and deliver better military capability while protecting American taxpayers."
"We need to continue reducing overhead and bureaucracy associated with the acquisition system, making it more agile and having a faster flow of commercial technology into our weapon systems.  DoD is comfortable with the reforms in the FY 2016 National Defense Authorization Act – which included several legislative reforms that DoD proposed last year – and we strongly support the increased role of the service chiefs in acquisition programs, particularly on cost and requirements trade-offs.  Going forward, it’s important that we take the responsible approach to absorb these reforms and see their effects before making additional major changes."
"DoD also appreciates Congress’s interest in flexibility and agility, because the pace of threat changes and technology development are not compatible with our long cycles of budget submission, authorization, and appropriations.  And DoD will be looking for opportunities to work with Congress to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our acquisition process.  In particular, we would welcome greater flexibility in appropriations or reprogramming to initiate development of urgently needed capabilities.  The flexibility to start a program as soon as a threat is identified would save critical time – as much as two years under current practices – and position both DoD and industry to more quickly initiate development, without a long-term commitment, outside the traditional budget cycle.  This step would represent a ‘free’ two years of lead time to acquiring a new capability."
Leaner Business Practices and Reducing Excess Overhead and Infrastructure
"The budget submission reflects several important efforts to spend taxpayer dollars more efficiently, generating savings that would be much better invested in other areas like the fight against ISIL or deterring Russian aggression."
"Part of this means making more reductions to overhead, and also adopting some commonsense business practices that are long overdue – which in total we expect to help save nearly $8 billion over the next five years.  By better managing the 20 percent management headquarters reductions I mentioned earlier, including delayering and flattening management organizational structures, and also by increasing the reduction to 25 percent, reviewing service contracts, and making business operations and IT more efficient, we expect to save close to $5.9 billion over the FYDP.  And we’re modernizing how we manage our commissaries and military exchanges, to optimize their business practices and respond to the changing needs of their customers.  Unlike commissary and military exchange reforms proposed in previous budgets, this new approach protects the benefits they provide our people while still generating expected savings of about $2 billion over the FYDP."
"We’re also making real progress on reforming DoD’s myriad systems and business processes to meet our commitment to be audit ready by the beginning of FY 2018.  The three military departments began audits of their budgets for the first time last year, and DoD financial audits currently cover over 75 percent of our total General Fund budgetary resources and just over 90 percent of the current year dollars."
"In addition, we need to stop spending so much money to hold onto bases we don’t need, and implement a domestic round of Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) in 2019 as we’re requesting.  While it’s helpful that the FY 2016 National Defense Authorization Act allowed a study of DoD’s excess infrastructure, the bottom line is that we have more bases in more places than we need, with preliminary analysis indicating that we have over 20 percent excess infrastructure.  To ignore this fact while criticizing DoD for wasteful spending is not only a sin of omission, but also a disservice to America’s taxpayers.  Last year’s Congressional denial forced the BRAC round to slip from 2017 to 2019, further prolonging our ability to harvest savings we greatly need.  By then it will have been 14 years since DoD was allowed to right-size its domestic infrastructure, which any business leader or citizen would think is ridiculous – and they’d be right.  Now is the time to fix it."
Reexamining Goldwater-Nichols and Defense Institutional Reform
"I appreciate that Congress shares my desire to make institutional reform a priority.  As a learning organization, the U.S. military and the Defense Department has a long history of striving to reform our command structures and improve how our strategies and policies are formulated, integrated, and implemented.  Indeed, even before the Defense Department was even established, military leaders and policymaking officials were discussing how the military services could be unified, and exploring ways to develop stronger policy processes and advice.  The result was the National Security Act of 1947 and its amendments, which, among other historic changes, established the position of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the National Security Council.  Later reforms, particularly Eisenhower-era changes, helped strengthen the offices of the Defense Secretary and gave new authorities to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs."
"But it was the Goldwater-Nichols Act, enacted 30 years ago this fall, that’s most responsible for today’s military and defense institutional organization.  It solidified the chain of command from the President to the Secretary of Defense to the Combatant Commanders.  It affirmed civilian control of the military by codifying in law that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs is outside the chain of command, in order for him to be able to provide vital, objective, independent military advice to the Defense Secretary and the President.  At the same time, it also strengthened the Chairman’s role, created the position of Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and centralized the role and voice of the Combatant Commands.  And it reinforced the concept of jointness, especially with respect to the careers of senior officers, by requiring them to gain professional experience outside of their service in order to advance further in their careers.  All senior officers know these policies today, for they are integral to career advancement and achievement, and they reflect the reality of how our servicemembers train and fight every day as a joint force.  Around this time, albeit unrelated to Goldwater-Nichols, important changes were made to reform defense acquisition, based on the recommendations of the Packard Commission."
"As a whole, all these changes were overwhelmingly beneficial – a credit to the work of not only the members of Congress who passed the legislation, but also their staffs.  What they put into law has given us generations of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines who’ve grown accustomed to operating together as a joint force – overcoming many inter-service frictions of decades before.  And it’s enabled our nation to draw greater benefit from the advice of many valued Chairmen – from General Colin Powell during Operation Desert Storm, to General Joe Dunford today."
"This year, as Goldwater-Nichols turns 30, we can see that the world has changed since it was enacted: instead of the Cold War and one clear threat, we face a security environment that’s dramatically different, even from the last quarter-century.  It’s time that we consider practical updates to this critical organizational framework, while still preserving its spirit and intent.  For example, we can see in some areas how the pendulum between service equities and jointness may have swung too far, as in not involving the service chiefs enough in acquisition decision-making and accountability; or where subsequent world events suggest nudging the pendulum further, as in taking more steps to strengthen the capability of the Chairman and the Joint Chiefs to support force management, planning, and execution across the combatant commands, particularly in the face of threats that cut across regional and functional combatant command areas of responsibility, as many increasingly do."
"With this in mind, last fall I asked DoD’s Deputy Chief Management Officer, Peter Levine, and Lieutenant General Tom Waldhauser of the Joint Staff, to lead a comprehensive, department-wide review of these kinds of organizational issues – spanning the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Staff, the combatant commanders, and the military departments – to identify any potential redundancies, inefficiencies, or other areas of possible improvement. And they’ve now come to some preliminary recommendations. Over the coming weeks, we will execute some of these decisions under our own existing authority.  For others, where legislation is needed, we would like to work with Congress on implementation as it considers this year’s National Defense Authorization Act.  Of course, both House and Senate Armed Services Committees have their own important reviews of this issue underway as well – making this area ripe for working together, something we’ve been doing effectively, and will continue to do on this topic.  Because when it comes to these fundamental matters of our national security, that’s what we have to do – work together."
"First, we need to better develop transregional and multifunctional integration and advice – an imperative considering that the challenges we face today are less likely than ever before to confine themselves to neat regional or functional boundaries.  Terrorism is one example, of course; beyond that, we also face potential future nation-state adversaries with widening geographic reach, but also widening exposure – something we may want to take into account in order to de-escalate a crisis and deter aggression.  And in other cases, we may have to respond to multiple threats across the globe in overlapping time frames.  In an increasingly complex security environment like this, and with a decision chain that cuts across the combatant commands only at the level of the Secretary of Defense, we’re not postured to be as agile as we could be.  Accordingly, we need to clarify the role and authority of the Chairman, and in some cases the Joint Chiefs and the Joint Staff, in three ways: one, to help synchronize resources globally for daily operations around the world, enhancing our flexibility, and my ability, to move forces rapidly across the seams between our combatant commands; two, to provide objective military advice for ongoing operations, not just future planning; and three, to advise the Secretary of Defense on military strategy and operational plans, for example, helping ensure that our plans take into account in a deliberate fashion the possibility of overlapping contingencies.  We will pursue these changes in line with Goldwater-Nichols’s original intent, which is to enable the military to better operate in a seamless way, while still preserving both civilian control and the Chairman’s independence to provide professional military advice outside of the chain of command.  Some have recommended the opposite course – to put the Chairman into the chain of command – but both Chairman Dunford and I agree that would erode the Chairman’s objectivity as the principal military advisor to the President and the Secretary of Defense.  "
"The second area where we need to make updates is in our combatant commands – adapting them to new functions, and continuing to aggressively streamline headquarters. Adapting to new functions will include changes in how we manage ourselves in cyberspace.  DoD must deal with the five challenges facing our nation, across all domains – not just the traditional air, land, sea, and space, but also cyberspace, where our reliance on technology has given us great strengths and great opportunities, but also some vulnerabilities that adversaries are eager to exploit.  That’s why the budget increases cyber investments over the next five years, and why we should consider changes to cyber’s role in DoD’s Unified Command Plan.  Meanwhile, DoD is currently in the process of reducing our management headquarters by 25 percent – a needed step – and we’re on the road to accomplish that goal thanks to the partnership of the congressional defense committees, which once again we deeply appreciate.  We can meet these targets without combining Northern Command and Southern Command, or combining European Command and Africa Command – actions that would run contrary to why we made them separate, because of their distinct areas of emphasis and increasing demands on our forces in them.  And indeed those demands have only further increased in recent years, with each command growing busier.  So instead of combining these commands to the detriment of our friends, our allies, and in fact our own command and control capabilities, we intend to be more efficient by integrating functions like logistics, intelligence, and plans across the Joint Staff, the combatant commands, and subordinate commands, eliminating redundancies while not losing capability.  Much can be done here.  Additionally, in the coming weeks the Defense Department will look to simplify and improve command and control where the number of four-star positions have made headquarters either top-heavy, or less efficient than they could be.  The military is based on rank hierarchy, where juniors are subordinate in rank to their seniors; this is true from the platoon to the corps level, but it gets complicated at some of our combatant and component command headquarters, where we have a deep bench of extremely talented senior leaders.  So where we see potential to be more efficient and effective, billets currently filled by four-star generals and admirals will be filled by three-stars in the future."
"Next is acquisition. Thirty years after the Packard Commission’s recommendations led to the establishment of an undersecretary of defense for acquisition, service acquisition executives, and the roles of program executive officers and program managers, it’s clear we still can and must do more to deliver better military capability while making better use of the taxpayers’ dollars.  One way we seek to improve in this context is by streamlining the acquisition system itself.  This will include evaluating and where appropriate reducing other members of the Defense Acquisition Board – it’s currently composed of about 35 principals and advisors, each of whom is likely to feel empowered as a gatekeeper for acquisition; reducing these layers will both free up staff time and focus decision-making energy on overcoming real obstacles to program success rather than bureaucratic hurdles.  And we also intend to reduce burdensome acquisition documentation – just for one example, in cases where the defense acquisition executive serves as the milestone decision authority, the current process dictates that 14 separate documents be coordinated within the department.  Reducing these paperwork requirements in a meaningful way, and pushing approval authority lower down when a program is on the right track, will eliminate redundant reviews and shorten review timelines – ultimately getting capabilities fielded to our troops sooner, which our service chiefs and our combatant commanders desire and deserve."
"The last major area where we need to update Goldwater-Nichols is in making changes to joint personnel management.  One of the hallmarks of Goldwater-Nichols is that it made joint duty required for all officers who wanted to rise to the highest levels of our military.  In so doing, it led to great advances in jointness across the military services – such that almost all our people know why, and how, we operate as a joint team – and it’s also significantly strengthened the ability of our Chairmen, our Joint Chiefs, and our Combatant Commanders to accomplish their joint responsibilities.  But as we’ve learned over the years what it takes to operate jointly, it’s become clear that we need to change the requirements for joint duty assignments, which are more narrow and rigid than they need to be.  Accordingly, we’re proposing to broaden the definition of positions for which an officer can receive joint duty credit, going beyond planning and command-and-control to include joint experience in other operational functions, such as intelligence, fires, transportation and maneuver, protection, and sustainment, including joint acquisition.  For example, while a staff officer in a combatant command would get joint duty credit, an officer in a combined air operations center coordinating with servicemembers in all different uniforms to call in airstrikes against ISIL might not.  In another case, take two cyber airmen working at a combatant command – one does cyber plans and gets joint credit, the other does cyber targeting and doesn’t.  And while a logistics planner at a combatant command doesn’t receive joint credit, their operational plans counterpart does.  So what we’re proposing will fix these discrepancies and fulfill the true purpose of Goldwater-Nichols, which was to ensure meaningful joint experience.  Additionally, we’re also proposing to shorten the amount of time required to accumulate joint duty, from three years to two years, so top personnel have more flexibility to take on command assignments and other opportunities to broaden and deepen their careers."
"Now, going forward, it’s important to make all these updates under the guiding principle of ‘do no harm.’  Goldwater-Nichols took four years to write, and it’s been incredibly successful over three decades – to the credit of the reforms it put in place, we are not driven today by a signal failure like Desert One.  To the contrary – I’m deeply proud of how our people have operated in Iraq and Afghanistan over the last 15 years.  So we come at this from a different direction, and the updates we make now must not undo the many positive benefits that Goldwater-Nichols has had for DoD.  Instead, they must build on them."
Modernizing and Simplifying the Military Healthcare System
"DoD greatly appreciates that Congressional leaders have said 2016 will be the year to reform our military healthcare system, TRICARE, after having passed retirement modernization reform in 2015.  As you know, DoD has proposed various ways to reform TRICARE for several years, so we look forward to working very closely with Congress in the year ahead.  The reforms reflected in the budget give beneficiaries more simplicity and choice in how they manage their healthcare, while also incentivizing the much more affordable use of military treatment facilities.  This will not only save money, but also maximize the workload and readiness of our military’s medical force, giving our doctors, nurses, medics, and corpsmen the experience they need to be effective at their mission.  Together this should generate about $548 million in FY 2017 and almost $7 billion over the FYDP that can be better spent in other ways without sacrificing the care of our people.  It’s time to get this done."
Making Sure Retirement Reform Works
"DoD greatly appreciates being able to work closely with Congress last year in reforming the military’s retirement system.  In this year’s budget submission, we are including a few modifications to military retirement reform to help make sure those reforms work in the best possible way for the future strength and success of our military."
"First, continuation pay should not be an entitlement at 12 years of service, but rather a vitally important force shaping tool.  DoD should have the flexibility to determine if and when to offer this benefit so we can better retain the talent we need the most at any given time."
"Second, the blended retirement plan that Congress passed last year needs some modifications to avoid having adverse effects on retention – in particular, slightly raising the maximum matching contribution from 4 percent to 5 percent.  To improve retention, we also propose increasing the number of years a servicemember has to serve before matching contributions begin – so instead of beginning them at the start of their third year of service, it would be at the start of their fifth year of service, after their first reenlistment.  DoD looks forward to working with Congress to make these proposals a reality."
The Right Force Structure for Current and Future Operations
"The budget also reflects critical decisions on force structure reforms, all of which are vital to making sure our troops have the capabilities they need for both present and future missions.  While Congress has too often rejected such reforms out of hand, our decisions this year show that when world events and operational demands require the Defense Department to change its plans, it does so.  In turn, Congress must do the same, and recognize that with a set budget and the need to invest in advanced capabilities to strengthen high-end deterrence, it’s time to seriously consider these reforms and stop tying our hands from implementing them."
"I mentioned earlier that we’re pushing off the A-10’s final retirement until 2022 so we can keep more aircraft that can drop smart bombs on ISIL; in addition to changing when A-10s will be retired, we’re also changing how it will happen.  As 2022 approaches, A-10s will be replaced by F-35s only on a squadron-by-squadron basis as they come online, ensuring that all units have sufficient backfill and that we retain enough aircraft needed to fight today’s conflicts."
"While some members of Congress may think the Navy’s phased approach for modernizing its guided missile cruisers is just a ploy to quickly retire them, that is incorrect – in fact, retiring them now or anytime soon would be a serious mistake.  Our cruisers are the best ships we have for controlling the air defenses of a carrier strike group, and given the anti-ship missiles being developed by other nations, we not only can’t afford to go without them; we also need them to be as modern and capable as possible, and for them to stay in service as long as they can.  The Navy’s plan is still smarter and more affordable than the approach laid out by Congress, saving us $3 billion over the FYDP that we’re putting to good use elsewhere in the budget.  And to make clear that this is not a ploy to quickly retire our cruisers, we will be submitting proposed legislative language that Congress can pass to hold the department to its word."
"Additionally, the Army is continuing to implement its Aviation Restructure Initiative in accordance with the FY 2015 National Defense Authorization Act as the Chief of Staff of the Army reviews the recent findings of the National Commission on the Future of the Army.  While we will revisit the Army’s aviation transfer plan when we receive the Chief of Staff of the Army’s report, the Commission’s proposal to keep four Apache battalions in the Army National Guard could cost over $2.4 billion if the Army fully equips all 20 active battalions and keeps all aircraft currently dedicated to its equipment set in South Korea.  By improving the readiness of the Army’s Apache attack helicopters, and better leveraging the diverse capabilities Black Hawk helicopters bring to the table for National Guard missions – both here at home, and around the world when called upon as an operational reserve – the Army’s planned Aviation Restructure Initiative is in the best interests of both the Army as well as the taxpayers who support it."
The Opportunity of Reform
"Regardless of how any of our proposed reforms might be initially received, DoD needs Congress to work together with us on a path forward for all of them, because there’s a real opportunity in front of us."
"With last fall’s budget deal, you showed that cooperation and prudent compromise for the good of our future security and strength was actually possible.  And our reform submissions on things like the A-10, commissaries, and TRICARE reflect the fact we’ve heard Congress’s concerns about past submissions, and made adjustments accordingly."
"If we don’t lead the way ahead together, both troops and taxpayers alike will be forced to deal with the consequences.  So let’s work together on their behalf."
VI. REQUESTS OF THIS COMMITTEE: THE IMPERATIVE OF WORKING TOGETHER
"Before concluding, I want to reemphasize the big picture, because this budget marks a major inflection point for the Department of Defense, and we need your support for it."
"For a long time, DoD tended to focus and plan and prepare for whatever big war people thought was coming over the horizon, at one point becoming so bad that after a while, it started to come at the expense of current conflicts – long-term at the expense of the here-and-now.  Thankfully we were able to realize that over the last decade, correct it, and with help from Congress turn our attention to the fights we were in."
"The difference today is that, while such a singular focus made sense when we were facing off against the Soviets or sending hundreds of thousands of troops to Iraq and Afghanistan, it won’t work for the world we live in.  Now we have to think and do a lot of different things about a lot of different challenges – not just ISIL and other terrorist groups, but also competitors like Russia and China, and threats like North Korea and Iran.  We don’t have the luxury of just one opponent, or the choice between current fights and future fights – we have to do both, and we have to have a budget that supports both.  That means funding a force with the right size, readiness, and capabilities to prevail in today’s conflicts while simultaneously building a force that can prevail in the future – recognizing that future force won’t exist unless we take actions today.  That’s what this budget submission was designed to do, and we need your help to do it."
"I thank this committee again for overwhelmingly supporting the Bipartisan Budget Act that set the size of our budget; our submission focuses on the budget’s shape, and we hope you approve it.  I know some may be looking at the difference between what we proposed last year and what we got in the budget deal, but I want to reiterate that we’ve mitigated that difference, and that this budget meets our needs.  "
"In this context, I have serious concerns with a proposal from one of the defense committees to underfund DoD’s overseas warfighting accounts by $18 billion, and spend that money on programmatic items we didn’t request.  While I don’t expect this committee to consider such a proposal, I have to say that this approach is deeply troubling, and flawed for several reasons.  It’s gambling with warfighting money at a time of war – proposing to cut off our troops’ funding in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria in the middle of the year.  It would spend money on things that are not DoD’s highest unfunded priorities across the joint force.  It buys force structure without the money to sustain it and keep it ready, effectively creating hollow force structure, and working against our efforts to restore readiness.  It doesn’t address the much bigger strategic risk DoD faces of $100 billion in looming automatic cuts; in fact, it’s a step in the direction of unraveling the Bipartisan Budget Act, which provided critical stability that DoD needs now and desires for the future.  And it’s another road to nowhere, with uncertain chances of ever becoming law, and a high probability of leading to more gridlock and another continuing resolution…exactly the kind of terrible distraction we’ve seen for years, that undercuts stable planning and efficient use of taxpayer dollars, dispirits troops and their families, baffles friends, and emboldens foes.  I cannot support such maneuvers as Secretary of Defense."
"The budget deal was a good deal – it gave us stability, and for that we remain grateful.  Doing something to jeopardize that stability would concern me deeply.  The greatest strategic risk we face in DoD is losing that stability this year, and having uncertainty and sequester in future years.  That’s why going forward, the biggest concern to us strategically in the Congress is averting the return of sequestration next year so we can sustain all these critical investments over time."
"By working together, I am confident we can succeed, because in many ways we already have.  If we think back to those defense investments and decisions that changed the course of our nation’s and our military’s history for the better – and not just in technologies like GPS, the Internet, and satellite communications, but also in other areas, like jointness and the all-volunteer force – they were all able to benefit our security and our society because they garnered support across the aisle, across branches of government, and across multiple administrations."
"That same support for what’s in this budget is essential today to address the security challenges we face and seize the opportunities within our grasp.  We need your support in the decisions that our senior military leaders and I are advocating for.  We need you to work with us, and not tie our hands, when it comes to pursuing smart and critical reforms.  And we need you to provide adequate, stable, predictable resources, as only you can, by coming together as you have before – including, in the coming years, to avert the return of sequestration once again.  As long as you do, I know our national security and national strength will be on the right path, and America’s military will continue to defend our country and help make a better world for generations to come."

     Thanks for that short introduction.  I like it.
"     Secretary James, General Goldfein, distinguished general officers, members of the broader Air Force community and industry, it's just great to be here, and it's good to be among familiar faces."
"I want to start by commending the Air Force Association for all it does on behalf of the 600,000 men and women of the United States Air Force, Air Force Reserve, and Air Force National Guard.  AFA has helped make the United States Air Force the most technologically advanced, most operationally adaptable, and most powerful aerospace force in the world, able to project power anywhere at any time throughout the globe.  I want to thank all AFA members, past and present, for their hard work and truly outstanding support."
"     I next want to say that I'm more than a little nervous.  This is the first time that the Air Force Association has ever invited me to speak at their symposium, and I was preparing my remarks, and I kept asking myself:  How do I address a crowd that lives by a pretty stark binary choice:  Live in fame, go down in flames.  "
"That's downright intimidating.  So I looked for some inspirations from some previous speakers.  And speaking at the first-ever AFA event in 1947, the year the Air Force was born nearly 70 years ago, Dwight Eisenhower described the assembled group as a combination of, quote, ""design and production men of genius,"" unquote.  Along with, quote, ""masters of the application of air power, whose imagination and energy made the skies broad avenues in the victory of war.""  He obviously lived in the ""live in fame"" school of thought."
"     But in all honestly, I didn't need a lot of inspiration.  I get inspired every time I encounter this do-or-die thinking; every time I visit an air base, wherever that might be.  Like the time I was at Anderson Air Force Base on Guam.  I was headed to my plane after a very nice visit there, and I was accompanied by Brigadier General Toth, who at the time was a one-star."
"And as we approached the airfield, I spotted a pair of B-2 bombers sitting on the ramp, surrounded by some ground crew and maintainers.  And I turned to General Toth and said, ""Hey, would you mind if we go look at those airplanes up close?""  He said, ""No problem.""  So we raced over to the B-2s.  We got out of our vehicles.  We started walking toward a young Air Force security policeman standing watch over the B-2s."
"     I said, ""Good morning, Airman.  I'm Bob Work.  I'm the Deputy Secretary of Defense.  I'd like a closer look at the bombers, if I may.""  Now, I could see the wheels starting to turn in his head.  He composed himself looked me right in the eye.  And I am not kidding.  And he replied in a courteous, but firm voice:  ""Well, I am Airman First Class Taylor.  I am not permitted to allow anyone, including the deputy secretary of all defense, to approach these aircraft without prior approval of my flight chief.  And General Toth, you are not on my access list."" "
"So he said, ""Please step away from the nuclear stealth bomber.”  And then, for good measure, Airman Taylor confiscated the film of my assigned photographer who had taken a picture of me taking to Airman Taylor but had the B-2s in the background.  And then it stuck me like a thunderbolt or a JDAM.  Airman First Class Taylor knew that he was either going to live in fame or go down in flames."
"     But he stepped up and did what he thought was right, guided by his training and his instructions and let the cards fall as they may.  And so in doing -- and in so doing, at least in my mind, he lived in fame."
"     Now, I love to tell stories like this because they portray the true secret weapon of the United States joint force, our people.  So in the spirit of all Airman Taylors and our remarkable Air Force, and in the broader joint force, let me say that I hope this speech emphasizes some Air Force fame and that I leave here today with no telltale trail of smoke."
"     But first, let me get two things off my chest.  Too often, I hear commentary to the effect that our military is weakened because we are so inefficient.  And look, as with any large organization, DOD has a lot of management challenges.  And as the COO of the department, I am painfully aware of most of them."
"     But we have a unique mission.  And I tell this every time I talk with a group of people who don't work in the Department of Defense and don't understand what we're all about.  That mission is to recruit, organize, equip, train, educate, exercise and retain a joint force that is ready for war and operated forward to help preserve or enforce or compel the peace, depending on what our president asks us to do."
"     And while we will -- while we will always try to be efficient, for a mission as important of ours, we judge ourselves first and foremost by our effectiveness.  Because the prospect of failure is unthinkable to all of us."
"     And lets make this clear.  We're pretty damned effective.  This department and the Air Force produces the finest, best-trained, best-led, most adaptable, most lethal fighting force this world has ever seen."
"     And every day, our military operates on a global scale and at an operational tempo that no military can match or even come close to matching.  Regardless of the problems we face, and look, we all know there are many, we should never forget that.  Because if we do, our enemies surely will, and that will be a bad day for the United States of America."
"Now, I also get mad as hell when I hear somebody say the department is some kind of aging, ponderous organization that has lost its ability to innovate.  Nonsense.  I would say other words, but we're in polite company.  I strongly believe, and I know the historical record will back me up, that since its formation in 1947, the Department of Defense has been an engine of innovation that should be the envy of any organization, past or present, government or commercial, anywhere on this planet."
"And you know what?  The United States Air Force has been one of the key reasons this was so.  I was at the Aspen Strategy Group when somebody started saying that the Department of Defense could no longer innovate.  And Richard Danzig, a former secretary of the Navy, said:  Wait just a second.  Consider a second lieutenant who joined the Air Force in 1953 and who retired in 1993 as a four-star.  I was one lucky second lieutenant."
"But over the course of that one career, that officer would see the transition from propeller to jet, the development and perfection of air-to-air refueling, the development and fielding of intercontinental range bombers, the incorporation of air-to-air nuclear missiles, air-to-ground nuclear bombs, the development of high altitude spy aircraft like the U-2."
     And my heart goes out to the crew that had to bail out yesterday and especially to the family who lost their loved one.
"But the development and fielding of intercontinental ballistic missiles, the move to space, the development of high-altitude Mach 3 spy planes like the SR-71 Blackbird, the development and employment of guided munitions, the perfection of the suppression of enemy and air defenses, the development of air battle management command and control platforms, Stealth, air-launched, even ground-launched nuclear cruise missiles."
"And by 1991, the demonstration of the power of what we now call the Combined Air Operations Center, which I'll talk about in just a moment."
"     So people think we can't innovate?  Please.  Look, we're constantly tinkering.  We're constantly innovating.  We're constantly experimenting."
"     I think the problem is that people conflate the idea of innovation with the idea of organizational agility.  And I think we all can agree that we need to be more agile.  But when it comes to innovation, I'd put us up against everyone.  Drop the mic, boom, period, end of story."
"     And that's why I want to focus the balance of my remarks on Air Force leadership during times of dynamic technological disruption that can cause profound shifts in the military competition.  Because that, ladies and gentlemen, is exactly where we are today."
"     First things first.  Since World War II, our national security strategy has always striven to achieve a comfortable measure of what I'll call comprehensive strategic stability, a word that was coined by an Air Force colonel who taught at the Air War College."
"     It has three pillars:  strategic deterrence, conventional deterrence, and managing the strategic environment.  Those three things have to be in balance for us to achieve comprehensive strategic stability.  So let's start with strategic deterrence."
"From day one in 1947, the U.S. Air Force has been all about the strategic deterrence mission.  First, President Truman and then President Eisenhower dramatically increased Air Force funding and the Air Force greatly expanded its bomber fleet, creating the first -- world's first truly integrated global attack force."
"Now, this burgeoning Air Force -- airborne arsenal required new organizational constructs.  This was the hey-day of the Strategic Air Command.  Now, those of you who know me know I'm a huge movie buff.  Two of my favorite moves are ""Strategic Air Command,"" Jimmy Stewart, B-36 Peacemakers, B-47s, and June Allyson.  What's not to like?"
"     But the one I really like is ""Dr. Strangelove,"" because Slim Pickens, he got to live in fame and go up in flames by riding that nuclear bomb down onto the Soviet Union."
"Now, Eisenhower also made ICBM program a top priority and under legendary Air Force General Bernard Schriever, the ICBM program became the new Manhattan Project, and by the late 1950s the Air Force would turn out first the Atlas, then the Titan, then the Minuteman that still serves us today."
"Ike was the one who ordered up the U-2 spy satellite so we could determine exactly what the nuclear balance was; the first reconnaissance satellites, once the U-2 became vulnerable; and the command and control installation in space to allow us to fight through a nuclear exchange.  All of these were under Air Force leadership and management."
"     Now these new weapons demanded new doctrine and war plans, yet every theater commander at the time had their own plans to serve their own immediate objectives, and it required U.S. Air Force General Nathan Twining, chairman at the time, to go against his own service's desires and to get Ike to order the services to develop one target list, what is now, or was known as the single integrated operational plan, or SIOP."
"     All of you know how this story goes.  Some six decades later, the Air Force continues to operate two of the three legs of this strategic triad, which underwrites our strategic deterrent.  The triad is aging, and it's harder to maintain, and we're going to have to update it.  But there are thousands of Airman Taylors out there -- I've met some of them -- who are making sure these systems remain safe, secure and reliable and, God forbid, if necessary, to respond if the president calls."
"We got out of balance in the 1950s.  As successful as the strategic deterrent force was, the Korean War proved that strategic deterrence was not a substitute for conventional deterrence.  That said, when Ike became the president, he was told they would need 92 NATO divisions to deter and if necessary repel a Warsaw Pact attack against Western Europe."
"For Ike, that was a total non-starter.  There was no way that we were going to have a standing army that big.  So he gambled that a smaller army, equipped and trained to employ battlefield nuclear weapons, and supported by new fighter bombers like the F-105 Thunderchief, the wonderful Thud, could deter and if necessary defeat a Soviet attack for much less cost."
"     And the new systems and new operational and organizational constructs that resulted were all part of what we now know as Eisenhower's New Look strategy, and what we refer to as the first offset strategy."
"Now fast forward to the 1970s.  As the U.S. emerged from Vietnam, we faced three big problems.  And, wow, there are echoes of this today."
"     First, there was a rapidly modernizing Soviet military, and it no longer had a three-to-one advantage.  We were worried it might have more. Second, the Soviets had achieved nuclear parity, and they had a new operational concept, designed to defeat the first offset strategy.  That was to blast through NATO's front lines with successive echelons of armored forces, opening a fissure so that an operational maneuver group could go deep into NATO's rear before its leaders could resort to nuclear weapons."
"     Both of these circumstances undermined the premise of the first offset.  And third, at home, we had budget constraints, serious budget constraints, because we were coming out of the Vietnam War."
"Now if that was not enough, the character of war was changing, and the Air Force led the way in this also.  It was marked by a very broad shift from unguided weapons to guided conventional weapons, especially at the tactical level of war.  A lot of people forget that we dropped 10,000 guided munitions over Vietnam between 1968 and 1972 -- excuse me, 28,000 guided munitions, 10,000 of them in the last year of the war in 1972."
"Five thousand were assessed as having been direct hits; another 4,000 achieved effects on targets; another 1,000, maybe 500 didn't guide -- didn't -- missed the target for some reason; operator error or equipment error."
"Then in 1973 the Yom Kippur War provided dramatic evidence of advances in surface-to-air missiles, and Israel's most advanced fighters, flown by the top pilots in the Middle East, if not among the world's best, lost their superiority for at least three days due to a SAM belt.  And Israeli armored forces were savaged by ATGMs, antitank guided munitions."
"U.S. analysts cranked their little models and extrapolated that the balloon went up in Europe's central front and we had suffered attrition rates comparable to the Israelis.  U.S. tactical air power would be destroyed within 17 days, and NATO would literally run out of tanks."
"     The first offset no longer worked.  So we went under a second offset. Defense Secretary Harold Brown and his Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Bill Perry, set about devising a new offset strategy.  Now the first thing was just to give all our tactical systems a competitive edge by embedding modern digital electronics."
"That's what made the AIM-7 the AIM-7.  The vacuum tubes in the AIM-7s in Vietnam did not work nearly as well as we had hoped or we needed them to.  So by embedding these digital electronics, advanced computing and better C3I, all of our tactical systems would get better."
"     But the real advance occurred when they said, look, let's take all of these technologies and apply them at the operational level of war -- the campaign level, combining airborne, high resolution synthetic aperture radar, and moving target indicator radars, facilities that could fuse all this information, and both airborne and ground-launched missiles carrying new, guided munitions, to strike at the second and third echelons before they reach the forward line of troops."
"Now they did not use this exact terminology at the time, but what they were describing is what we now call an operational-level battle network, consisting of three interconnected grids:  a sensor grid; a command, control, communications and intelligence, or C3I grid; and an effecter grid.  And it was visionary Air Force and Army leaders who saw the breathtaking potential of this vision."
"Teaming with DARPA, they developed a program called Assault Breaker, new capabilities that looked deep and shot deep.  What AWACS and the F-15 and AIM-7 did for Air Force air superiority and air warfare, these leaders hoped that Assault Breaker would do the same for ground combat on the inner German border."
"We demonstrated Assault Breaker in 1982 at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.  And when the Soviets got wind of this demonstration and understood the results, the impact was profound.  In less than two years, Soviet Marshall Ogarkov famously said that reconnaissance strike complexes, the Soviet and Russian term for battle networks, these could achieve the same destructive effects as low-yield tactical nuclear weapons."
"As one strategist said, the Soviets now, quote, ""Believe that their American rivals were scientific magicians.  What they said they could do, they could do,"" unquote.  The Soviets would have been even more shaken if they knew about a little project code name Have Blue, a new aircraft developed by engineers at Lockheed's Skunk Works.  Nearly invisible to radar and infrared sensors, it would become what we all know is the F-117."
"     And at the same time, the Air Force was developing Navstar, the precursor to the global positioning system which would link all blue forces and the entire battle network in time and space.  Now, that program -- and I was chiding Jamie Morin, who I understand is going to be given an award tonight, PA&E, the precursor for CAPE, said ""GPS is too expensive, you got to get rid of it."""
"     And in the midst of this, Bill Perry got on a helicopter.  It was in a blinded condition.  They took off, flew around, landed back on the same spot.  Perry asked the pilot:  ""How did you do this?""  And he said, ""I was navigating entirely by GPS, Navstar.""  And the light came on for Bill Perry immediately, not only for navigation and timing, but for GPS-guided weapons that could hone through the very clouds that were obstructing the pilots vision."
"     And GPS survived.  Leaders like Army General Donn Starry and Air Force General Bill Creech, among others, took the technological sauce of Assault Breaker to cook up whole new technological and operational constructs known as air-land battle and later NATO's follow-on forces attack."
"     Now, this is where the story gets real interesting for me.  Battle networks, up until Assault Breaker, were generally defensive in nature.  I can go back through the British home air defense system; the Navy's carrier -- carrier air -- fleet air defense system; the semi-automated ground environment, continental air system; the North Vietnamese integrated air defense system; and Assault Breaker were essentially defensive networks."
"     But Air Force officers said:  ""If we can make an offensive battle network in which we apply guided munitions throughout the depth and breadth of the battle space, there will be a true revolution in military effects."""
"     Now, long advocates of centralized application of airpower, Air Force officers instinctively had always argued and instinctively knew that you would need a battle network brain that could fuse all the information coming from the sensor grid, come up with a plan to achieve desired effects, and then convey that plan to be effects grid, the ATO."
"     And the brain, although we didn't call it that the time, is what we now know as the Combined Air Operations Center.  And we saw its stunning potential as the brain of an offensive battle network in Desert Storm."
"So theater-level conventional battle networks employing guided munitions were the centerpiece of what we now call the second offset strategy.  And they provided just as the Air Force officers projected, an astounding increase in U.S. fighting power that has served us for the last 25 years."
"But our competitors have looked at our advantages.  They've studied them.  They've looked for our weaknesses.  And as result, the second offset is wearing thin, just like the first offset before it.  Unsurprisingly then, the overwhelming conventional dominance that we have maintained across domains for the past 25 years is eroding.  In some instances, faster than others, but still the general trend is not something we just want to occur naturally."
"Consequently, as early as 2012, DOD started thinking about a third offset strategy simply to restore the margin of operational and tactical advantage that underwrites conventional deterrence.  So the first question that I always get:  Well, what are we trying to offset?  Pretty simple, most of our combat powers in the United States.  We no longer have large concentrations of forces in the theaters they might fight.  That gives our potential adversaries an initial advantage in time and space and probably numbers."
"     Second, our great power competitors have now achieved rough guided munitions parity, something that we haven't really had to deal with in quite some time."
"     And third, they know how important it is and how powerful our networks are, so they are spending an awful lot of money to pay for counter-network technologies such as electronic warfare, cyber and counter-space, because they know how central the space constellation was to the second offset."
"We call all of these things shorthand A2AD, but those are what we're trying to offset.  And the next natural question was:  ""Well, how are we going to achieve this?  There is a lot of different alternative futures.  What are we going to do?"""
"     Well, the Defense Science Board looked at all of the different technologies that were out there, and they said there is one thing that will improve the performance of the battle network more than any other, and you must win the competition because you were in it, whether you like it or not, and that is exploiting advances in artificial intelligence and autonomy that will allow the joint force to assemble and operate advanced, joint, collaborative human-machine battle networks of even greater power."
     And we believe strongly that this will help restore the margin of operational superiority and strengthen conventional deterrence.
"Now these will be composed of five key means.  We can talk about it in question and answer if you want, but generally:  learning machines; human-machine collaboration, which means using advanced computers and visualization to help humans make faster, better and more relevant decisions; assisted human operations, which means plugging every pilot every soldier, every sailor, every Marine into the overall battle network; human-machine combat teaming, new ways in which manned and unmanned platforms operate; and networked-enabled autonomous weapons -- all of them connected on a learning C3I network."
"     And we believe this vision is very well matched for an evolving era of technological dynamism, as well as warfare where challenges or multidomain and multifunctional and operations, especially cyber, E.W., and guided munitions salvos move really at high speeds.  These speeds are going to shrink the human-based OODA loop, and we're have to go after these technologies to fight fire with fire and buy back the time for our humans to make decisions that will allow us to prevail at the tactical and operational level of war."
"     Now, let me make one thing perfectly clear.  Offset strategies are not about technology per se, so it drives me crazy when people say, ""Oh, the third offset strategy is A.I. and autonomy.""  Wrong.  Offset strategies are about technologically enabled operational and organizational constructs that provide the joint force with an advantage, primarily at the operational level of war, but also the tactical, thereby strengthening conventional deterrence."
"     And we're starting to see examples of both.  General Hyten, Secretary James, General Welsh, the first organizational construct of the third offset is the JICSpOC, the Joint Interagency Combined Space Operations Center.  It is designed to perform battle management and command and control of a space constellation under threat of attack.  It has to fight through those attacks and provide the space support that the joint force relies upon.  We've never had something like that before, because we've never needed something like that before.  But it is the first step in the third offset to start to readdress and to extend our margin of operational superiority."
"     There are also new operational constructs like the U.S. Army's concept of Multi-Domain battle, which I'm going to be talking to the Army about at AUSA in a couple of weeks; and Navy's idea for electromagnetic maneuver.  All have the potential to once again transform the way the joint force fights."
"     So for me, this is an exciting time to be in the Department.  This is a time of intellectual foment, reflected by the Air Force's operational concept, which is shot through with third-offset thinking.  And I believe sets the Air Force on a course that will help lead the way."
"     But there is a specific area that I think the Air Force naturally can help to advance third offset thinking and serve the joint force well.  We need ideas on how to connect sensing and effects grids through a command and control grid that is multi-domain, multifunctional and coalition-friendly."
"As General Hal Hornburg once said, as the commander of ACC, ""If you can't control it, you can't command it.""  And Air Force thinkers have been thinking about this since, literally, World War II.  We need Air Force thinkers to expand the idea of the CAOC, and think in terms of building a joint learning C3I network that can mesh operations across domains, across functions, with allies, and sometimes across regions."
"Airmen think in terms of space, cyberspace and air.  This thinking comes naturally to you.  And I hope you can lead the joint force into a new way of thinking, where air superiority effects might originate from under the sea, or land superiority is made possible through 380-degree -- 360-degrees, sorry -- math challenged -- I am a Marine, so give me a break multidomain and multifunctional effects.  And maritime superiority that's achieved by cooperative operations at sea, on land, and in the air."
"     So I, before all of you, I would like to publicly commend the chief for taking this challenge up.  It's the most important thing we have to understand.  And we need a warfighter thinking about it all the way.  I also have the I.C. thinking about it in terms of the intelligence flow.  But we must have a warfighter approach just like we had going from the first to second offset, when we said, ""What is the brain that will make this work?  And what are the connections, the central nervous system, that will allow us to wield this battle network effectively?"""
"Now, this may sound too optimistic, but I believe this isn't too different from the airmen who did it on the hot dusty ranges of America's west, as they created new ways to combine capabilities during the test and training revolution of the '70s and the '80s.  Coming out of Vietnam in the early 1970s, a group of fighter pilots realized that if a pilot could survive the first 10 combat sorties, their odds of surviving the bulk of their tour went up dramatically."
"The driving idea was to fly realistic war scenarios, to blood fresh pilots and get them past those first 10 missions, a totally new concept in air training.  And the result was Red Flag.  Wow.  You go back and read the history.  In the first four years of Red Flags, we lost 24 aircraft to ground and air accidents.  We were using telephone poles to mimic fuel lines."
"     We had airmen sitting up on top of hills firing off bottle rockets to simulate SAM launches.  But the result is what we know today, Red Flag, which is the preeminent training ground for air warriors of all stripes."
"     The point is, it's going to take mavericks like those who were willing to push against inertia to drive innovation.  In the case of Red Flag, these were pilots who came fresh out of Vietnam.  And for them, it was a matter of blood.  They had lost friends and colleagues.  And they weren't going to allow it to happen again if it was at all possible."
"     So in spite of all bureaucratic obstacles, they succeeded.  And we need that same attitude in the Air Force today."
"     So once again, people complain to me, ""Work, you're just talking about another revolutionary affair; this is transformation in sheep's clothing, blah, blah, blah.""  It's all a load of crap.  It's about empowering the Airman Taylors, because we know we have the best people in the world.  And we have made it a national priority since World War II to never allow the Airman Taylors to go into combat without the greatest technological edge we could provide them."
"     Marry up our people with advanced technology, and you will have a force that will dominate any adversary, any time, in any alternative future."
"     And that's why in the third offset we emphasize human-machine collaboration, and human-machine combat teaming.  Because for us, the human is central.  And it is our greatest strength and our greatest trust."
"     So we need the Air Force, along with the Army, Navy and Marines, to give all the Airman Taylors in whatever uniform they're wearing time to experiment; to fail and learn.  And then we need to get out of their way, because they're going to tell us what we need to know, and they're going to tell us how we're going to live in fame."
"     In conclusion, let me quote Eisenhower again, because for an Army general, he sure did understand the Air Force.  He said, quote, ""The United States Air Force is a young organization.  From the beginning, it has been young in spirit and outlook, manned by doers and zealots, impatient of frill and dogma, who measure traditions, their contributions to the present, and rejected those that no longer earned their way."""
"     I have nothing more to add to Ike's sentiments, except that I wholeheartedly agree.  There must be, and I hope there will always be a place for this kind of thinking in our department and in our Air Force.  And the best we can do is give our people the raw materials, the oil, the canvas and the brushes, and turn them lose and see what type of beautiful things they can create."
"     May the airmen who serve our nation always be young in spirit and outlook.  May God guard and guide them as they fly, fight and win.  Aim high, Air Force.  Live in fame or go down in flames."
     Thank you very much.
"     (UNKNOWN):  Thanks very much, sir.  We have time for a few questions here."
"     Q:  We tightly controlled first and second offset technologies.  How do we overcome problems associated with not only being unable to protect third offset technologies, but also not necessarily being the best or having the best third offset technologies?"
"     MR. WORK:  This is a very, very, very good question."
"     First of all let me describe the third offset very much like the rifle, telegraph and railroad revolution.  The railroad and the telegraph were driven by commercial interests, and they changed society and ultimately changed the way war was fought."
"     Similarly, today A.I. and autonomy is being driven by commercial interests.  We have A.I. and autonomy starting to change our society and the way we live, and it will inevitably have the same impact on war that the rifle, telegraph and railroad revolution did."
"     And as the question implies, because they are commercially available, all competitors are going to have them.  So it's going to be much like the interwar period.  Everyone knew that there were advances in aviation.  Everyone knew that there was mechanization.  Everyone knew there was a thing called the radio."
     But only the Germans put all of the pieces together to have an operational and organizational construct called Blitzkrieg that allowed them to dominate the field of battle for about three years.
"     Now, the thing about that, this is what now we're faced with.  It's the person who can put them together in operational and organizational constructs and then train the force and exercise the force to be ready to employ them.  And we've got a damn big advantage in that."
"When we said we wanted own the night, we owned the night within 10 years.  When we said we were going to go after guided munitions, we went after guided munitions in a big way.  When we said we were going to use a space constellation in support of operational tactical commanders, after three decades of using it to support the national command authority for nuclear war, we were ready to do it because our people had already thought it out."
"     You go out to the JICSpOC right now and watch the experimentation.  We are putting it all together.  And that is why -- look, it's not the technology.  Who gets the technology to the field faster?  Doesn't matter.  If it matters, it only will matter is if we can employ it to tactical and operational effect on the battlefield."
"     So this is going to be a competition of fast followers.  There are going to be people who see somebody do something and say, ""Whoa, I can do that.  In fact, I might do it a little differently and I will do it this way,""  And as long as we're a fast leader, that's okay."
"     But it is a way we get it to the field faster than our opponents, and constantly keep them in a tail chase.  And that's why I am relatively confident that we'll do okay."
"     Now, are we going to get technologically surprised?  You're damned sure we are.  We're going to be technology surprised.  So although we must strive to be a fast leader, we better be a fast follower.  And that's why I say we've got to get better at agility, organizational agility.  We've got the innovation part down pat, but we've got to be better and more agile without question, and that is how we are going to do this in the third offset."
     Q:  Thank you.
"Sir, you directed the standup of the electronic warfare executive committee 18 months ago.  After receiving the Defense Science Board's assessment of the status of electronic warfare across DOD, do you feel that the DOD has increased its understanding and prioritization of electronic warfare and electronic magnetic spectrum operations?"
"     MR. WORK:  No, not yet.  Look, there's four areas in which we struggle within the department because they go across so many different programs and across all the services, across all the components, across all the COCOMs.  That's electronic warfare, space, cyber and nukes."
"     And because of that, up to this point all of the investment has been decentralized, which is okay as far as it goes.  But the reason why we set up the XCom was to say, ""Hey, look, if we're going to set ourselves up for a competition and set us up to be more agile, we have to have a better view at the enterprise-wide level of how this stuff is all coming together."""
"So in the 18 months that we have had the XCom and now the CIMB, the Cyber Investment Management Board, we now at least have a clear understanding of where we're headed across the enterprise in terms of investment."
"     And, for example, there is a big debate going on in the department -- is stand-in jamming better than standoff jamming?; What is the combination?  We've got to work through all of this.  So I would say the XCom is the first step.  Tell us how we're employing our resources, then we'll ask the next step:  How should we change the way we are doing this?"
"     And it's going to make the services a little uncomfortable because we're going to have to go at an enterprise-wide level and we're going to have to be directive.  And this generally is where in the DMAG, things become -- DMAG, the Deputy Management Action Group, this is where things get sporty."
"     Offsets tend to be revolutionary as opposed to incremental improvements, which can force change to existing doctrine and organizational structures.  How do you envision the third offset changing our doctrine for how we conduct war and -- and focus our force structure?"
"MR. WORK:  Well the first thing is a lot of people worry about the Terminator.  They worry about Skynet.  Look, what this is going to be is a gradual implementation of narrow A.I. throughout the battle network.   So it will appear initially to be gradual, but if Fingers (General Goldfein)) is able to figure out a vision for a learning C3I network in which all of the narrow A.I. is contributing to better, faster knowledge, and connecting the sensor grid to the effects grid, then that is when you'll see the major revolutionary step."
"Just like we've had guided munitions at the tactical level of war since 1942, but it wasn't until Desert Storm where Air Force officers said ""Let's harness this power at the campaign level,"" that there was a big change just like Blitzkrieg in World War II."
"So my answer will be in the next five to 10 years, we're going to try a lot of experimentation, at least this is what I hope.  We have resource challenges, I think you know all about them.  But we need to try a lot of experimentation and do the hard intellectual thinking which will say where is the jump point; where is the knee in the curve where the performance of the joint battle networks really begin to be revolutionary, instead of evolutionary?"
"And we'll look to people like Bill Creech and (FNGRs ?) and many, many, many other officers in the joint force to help us figure this out.  Look, I couldn't be prouder of our Air Force.  Over the last 15 years, in terms of conventional combat power, without question the Air Force has been reduced the most, and that is because we needed to build up our space capabilities.  We needed to build up our ISR capabilities, and we needed to build up our cyber capabilities."
"     The only reason why the Air Force is able to operate as it does today is because of the leadership and the people that are in this organization.  So I admire all of you, whether you wear the uniform or you serve as a civilian in the U.S. government service in the Department of Defense, or you serve as civilian and U.S. government service in the Department of Defense, or you're in the defense industry that supports us."
     You are all patriots.  I have very high esteem and regard for each of you and God bless you all.  I think I am getting the hook.

"STAFF:  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  Thank you for joining us today."
"This afternoon, Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment Ellen Lord will provide an update on the department's acquisition reform and innovation effort.  She will have an opening statement, and then we'll take your questions.  We do have a hard stop at 1:00, so please be respectful with your questions so everyone will have a chance.  We have a very large audience today."
"Ma'am, over to you."
"UNDERSECRETARY OF DEFENSE ELLEN M. LORD:  Thank you, Mike."
"Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  I appreciate you being here today."
It's been a little over a month since I provided an update on the department's decision to suspend Turkey from the F-35 program.
"Today I will first provide a brief update on our acquisitions policy reform goals and objectives, and then for the first time I will talk about acquisition innovation, which I think better characterizes our effort.  Then I'll be happy to take your questions."
"Since we last spoke, Secretary Esper was confirmed.  I meet weekly with him, including this morning, where I briefed him on major defense acquisition programs, counter-UAS activities, modernization and sustainment of the nuclear enterprise, and F-35 acquisition and sustainment.  We discussed acquisition reform and innovation, and how we are reducing timelines and lowering costs to provide the best capabilities for our men and women in uniform."
I'm thankful for his leadership and support of the acquisition community.
"Our reform, acquisitions, policies, all of our effort directly support our National Defense Strategy and our warfighters."
We at DOD are grateful for Congress passing a two-year budget agreement that provides the budgetary certainty the department needs to implement the National Defense Strategy.  The department cannot go back to the unpredictability of a continuing resolution.  Our men and women in uniform deserve better.
"So, the A&S mission is enabling the delivery and sustainment of secure and resilient capabilities to the warfighter and international partners quickly and cost-effectively.  Under this mission are six A&S goals supported by priorities in each.  I will step through each goal and list a few of the priorities."
"Number one:  Recruit, develop and retain a diverse acquisition and sustainment workforce.  We want to modernize the acquisition workforce talent, management tools and processes, as well as deliver content consistent with adult learning.  A great example of this modernization is the TEDx DAU event recently held at Fort Belvoir."
"Two:  Enable acquisition innovation.  Create, train and implement the adaptive acquisition framework.  For example, the rewrite of 5000 and development of software pathways.  Enable contracting at the speed of relevance.  In other words, be creatively compliant to use the simplest acquisition authority and contract type possible."
"Three:  Build a safe, secure and resilient defense industrial base.  Address impacts of prohibited foreign investments.  On the defensive side, we have CFIUS, Countering Foreign Investment in the U.S., and FIRRMA, Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act.  However, I want to go on the offense.  We're going to do this with a trusted capital marketplace."
"Four:  Ensure safe and resilient DOD installations.  Enhance the quality of military housing, ensure installation energy resilience, and cyber-secure our facilities."
"Five:  Increase weapons system mission capability while reducing operating costs.  Under this, improve F-35 execution, development, production and sustainment.  Enhance weapons systems' cyber-resiliency."
"Six:  Promote acquisition and sustainment initiatives with key international partners.  Enable timely foreign military sales deliveries via contracting, dialogue with industry, tech release and plans for exportability.  Partner with interagency and industry stakeholders to advance shared equities."
I'd like to highlight some of our accomplishments.
"On middle tier of acquisition, since November 2018, we have expanded from zero to more than 50 programs.  We're scheduled to publish formal policy in December, and I'm happy that we're seeing positive results for our warfighters, taking an average of over two years out of each of the programs."
"As part of our software acquisition and practices report -- we briefed you in May -- in cooperation with the CIO, the DOD Enterprise DevSecOps Reference Design was released this month.  This guide provides implementation and operational guidance to all DOD components to allow them to immediately adopt modern software development practices and speed the delivery of high-quality, secure and effective warfighting software capability to match the speed of operations."
Mike can get you a copy.
"A&S is now issuing new functional policies on mission engineering and intellectual property and assisting the -- with the re-issuance of several other functional policies.  By October 2019, we expect to formally stand up an OSD intellectual property cadre.  They will develop DOD policy within the whole-of-government effort to address concerns on data rights."
"Secretary Esper, Secretary Pompeo and the president have all spoken about the impact Chinese intellectual property theft is having on our national security, American commerce and the defense industry.  Again, we need to go on the offense to protect our technology versus merely acting defensively."
We continue to rewrite DOD 5000.01 and DOD Instruction 5000.02 with the goal of having signed policy by December 2019.
"On acquisition innovation, DOD acquisition is known for being expensive, with excessive cost overruns; flow, many years from R&D until capability is provided to the warfighter, and burdensome, with overregulation of services and industries."
"DOD acquisition innovation is being implemented within four broad categories:  one, restructuring acquisition, policy and governance; two, contracting at the speed of relevance; three, strengthening and securing the defense industrial base; and four, effective training of the acquisition workforce."
"Successful implementation of these acquisition change efforts will reduce timelines, lower costs and improve quality while rapidly introducing new technology to enhance capability for our warfighters."
"For example, in contracting at the speed of relevance, we have seen a 15 percent reduction of clauses in the DFARS, from 352 to 298, a 60 percent reduction in DFARS publication backlog, from 128 to 50, and a 50 percent reduction in procurement administrative lead time, from 32 to 16 months for multiple pathfinder projects."
"As we continue to leverage other transaction authorities in middle tier, as I mentioned earlier, we will continue to make a very significant difference."
"To secure the DOD supply chain, the department is creating the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification, CMMC program, in collaboration with Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab and Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute, as well as industry."
"The CMMC establishes security as the foundation to acquisition, and combines the various cyber-security standards into a unified standard."
"The CMMC framework will be made fully available in January 2020, and by June 2020, industry will see CMMC requirements as part of requests for information.  By fall of 2020, CMMC requirements will be included in requests for proposals and will be a go/no go decision."
"I continue to meet with our industry partners.  I meet one-on-one with prime CEOs monthly, jointly with major defense contractor leadership teams and senior DOD and service representatives, and more broadly with the industry trade associations."
"On July 31st, I had my most recent tri-association meeting as part of my ongoing engagement with industry.  We discussed the ongoing efforts between the government and industry to increase the security, reliability and resilience of our defense industrial base and our collective effort to execute the National Defense Strategy.  We also discussed the ongoing reform efforts within A&S, including our adaptive acquisition framework and the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification, and we highlighted the first cohort of our Industry Exchange Program, run by our Human Capital Initiatives Office.  The program was very successful in providing industry and government participants with a view on how the other side works and how we can work better together.  We will follow up again with another -- another of these exchange programs."
"Regarding the Military Housing Resident Bill of Rights, DOD and the military departments are finalizing a Military Housing Privatized Initiative, MHPI, Resident Bill of Rights, resident responsibilities document and common lease framework, which should be ready for publication and implementation by October.  Throughout the process to draft the proposed Resident Bill of Rights, department leaders have engaged Congress, military and veterans service organizations and the housing partners for input. Residents were also asked for input through an online survey."
"This is a step towards improving the trust and accountability of our leadership to provide safe, healthy homes for our military families renting privatized housing."
"On the PFAS Task Force, let me start by underscoring how important this issue is to the department, which is why we have stood up a task force led by Assistant Secretary of Defense Bob McMahon and has members from every service and OSD strongly engaged.  Last week, the task force presented Secretary Esper its 30-day update, which included operating principles on how the department will approach this issue in an aggressive and holistic way."
Mike can get you a copy of this.
"Let me be clear, the department remains absolutely committed to the health and safety of our men and women in uniform, their families and the communities in which they live."
"Regarding the Trusted Capital Marketplace Program, as I briefed you before, this is a public-private partnership that will convene trusted sources of private capital with innovative companies critical to the defense industrial base and national security."
"Since we last met, we stood up our team to manage both capital vetting requirements and industry outreach and matching efforts.  We have identified the first industry sector target goals, and we hope to have an industry outreach event in October which will focus on small UAS.  I can't provide any details on dollar amount or company names or numbers, but I'm encouraged we're moving forward."
"On the F-35, following Admiral Winter's retirement, I'm excited to have Lieutenant General Fick at the JPO.  Hopefully next month, he and I will have a joint press briefing here together to talk fully about the F-35 program, challenges and opportunities."
"We reached a handshake agreement with Lockheed Martin on the next F-35 lot buy, and we continue to negotiate those details.  When final, we will make an announcement providing all of the details."
"In closing, I remain fully committed to consistent and timely engagement with Congress, and have consistently met with professional staff members and members outside of hearings to talk about programs, reforms and to answer their questions.  Out of respect for the budget process, I will not comment on any proposed legislation or budget details."
"With that, I look forward to your questions."
STAFF:  Aaron?
"Q:  Okay, Aaron Mehta with Defense News."
"On the I.P. group that you're standing up, how much -- you say that it's part of the -- going on the offensive idea that you have to deal with China's I.P. theft.  Obviously, I.P. sharing has been an issue between Pentagon and industry, as well, getting that trust going."
How much of that group is looking just at China and how to defend I.P.?  And how much of that is working out the question of sharing I.P. with industry?
MS. LORD:  The group is really focused on how we as a government-industry partnership work together to address intellectual property.
"My experience says that typically we have problems with intellectual property when we don't clearly define what is owned by industry, and what will be owned by government at the outset of a program, so a lot of this really has to do with good program planning.  We've leveraged a lot of work that the Army has done, and we've come together as a department to establish policies that we can all work with."
"Q:  And then just on the -- the TCM, initially when you talked to us about this you said you thought it would be operating in July.  What's the -- the reason for the delay?  And does that affect the potential funding at all?  Because now it's off into the next fiscal year."
"MS. LORD:  I don't think it affects the funding, because most of the funding is going to come from outside of government."
"The reason that we held off to October was we found out that we build a model, and it wasn't such a good model.  We were going to do a lot with websites and a lot of inputs and outputs, and the more we talked, the more we realized the value is getting government together with industry, as well as capital providers, and describing what the challenges are we have and what we really need.  So we scrapped the idea, frankly, of a complicated, expensive website, and decided that what we wanted to do was to have face-to-face meetings and do more of them on very, very focused topics."
STAFF:  Jeff?
"Q:  Thank you.  Can you say -- sorry.  Jeff Schogel, Task & Purpose."
Can you say whether any Turkish pilots or maintainers have requested asylum in the United States since the -- the end of their -- the United -- DOD ended their participations?
MS. LORD:  Not to the best of my knowledge.  I'm not aware of any.
Q:  (inaudible).
"And on the Gerald Ford, it has these electro -- electro -- electromagnetic weapons elevators.  Given the problems on this ship, do you expect these type of elevators to be on other aircraft carriers?"
"MS. LORD:  Right now, the Navy is looking through that very, very carefully, so I would defer to the Navy on that."
STAFF:  Marcus?
Q:  Good morning.  Thanks for continuing to do these briefings.
"You mentioned earlier that you briefed Secretary Esper about the nuclear enterprise, and since we've last met, Boeing has said it will not bid on GBSD, so essentially leaving one competitor.  I was wondering, what is the -- the impact of Boeing's decision not to bid?  Is OSD going to get involved?"
"And does the department plan to take any action to ensure that Northrop's corner on the solid rocket motor business doesn't impact programs in the future, and I think specifically about how the cancellation of the G -- GMD Program (inaudible)?"
"MS. LORD:  Hey, that's a five-part question, I think there."
"Bottom line, right now, the GBSD procurement is open, so I'm not going to comment on that, other than to say, we continue to have dialogues with Boeing."
I'm not going to constrain any markets until we see where things fall out.  And we'll see what we get for proposals and how we move forward.
Q:  How about with the GBI?  Do you plan to do anything there to ensure that there's competition moving forward?
MS. LORD:  I think that we have a lot of opportunity for competition with GBI.
STAFF:  Justin?
"Q:  Okay, thank you.  Justin Doubleday with Inside Defense."
"Just on the Redesigned Kill Vehicle program that was canceled last week, one of the features of that program was the government acted as the systems integrator to the program."
"Could you just comment on the efficacy of that kind of acquisition strategy after the fact?  And for the next-generation interceptor, do you think you'll go forward with a similar acquisition strategy?"
MS. LORD:  I think we are rethinking that acquisition strategy.  No firm decisions have been made.
"But typically, in my experience, when the government directs certain sources versus letting the market play out, it doesn't serve government well and it doesn't serve industry well."
"Q:  Do high-profile failures like that kind of make it more difficult to -- you know, kind of move forward with major acquisition programs, and how you kind of wrestle with that issue?"
MS. LORD:  I think we need to learn.  We all have things that don't work out as we anticipated.  The key issue is to learn from them and move forward.
"Q:  Thank you.  Carla Babb, Voice of America."
"You mentioned that you updated Secretary Esper on the F-35 acquisition as well and I know when you were speaking to us before, you said there was 900-plus parts that Turkey had been building for us that we were going to be looking elsewhere to find."
"Can you just update us on where we are?  I know that Turkey was supposed to be out by March, but had that moved faster?  Is it mostly U.S. companies?"
"MS. LORD:  Those 900-plus parts will all be sourced in the U.S. initially.  We are well down the pathway, have been working it for almost a year now, in one form or another.  And we still are on the path to be out of Turkey by the end of March 2020."
Q:  Do we have a list of some of these companies?  Is that somewhere where we can see that?
"MS. LORD:  In terms of where the new parts are going?  Let me work on getting that for you.  Let me just make sure legally I don't have any issues with that, because that really is Lockheed Martin sourcing it; it's not the government's sources."
STAFF:  Lee?
"Q:  Hi.  Lee Hudson, Aviation Week."
"On middle-tier acquisition, since the strategy -- updated guidance isn't going to be issued until December, in the interim, how are you updating Congress on projects that are classified levels here?"
"MS. LORD:  We talk to Congress all the time, both through mid-tier briefings and then on acquisition updates.  We just had a large group from the HASC and SASC staffers here last week where we talked about it."
Q:  Okay.
"And do you think that's sufficient?  (inaudible) conference, those briefings?  Is that issuing proper documentation, formal documentation on updates?"
MS. LORD:  I'm not sure what proper documentation is that we're not --
Q:  It's like --
MS. LORD:  -- submitting.
"I think it's very effective to talk about where we are with the programs and how we're moving forward.  And, frankly, I find the dialogue extremely useful."
So there's been an ongoing dialogue.  There's nothing been held back.
STAFF:  Tony?
"Q:  I'll stay on Section 804.  One of the concerns we're hearing from Capitol Hill is they're worried the services might expand this authority too much and have programs in it for which the authority wasn't really intended, large and dense."
What type of oversight do you think you need to provide to prevent that from happening?  Or do you think that ought not to be prevented from happening?
MS. LORD:  This is very much a part of our policy which we have been developing in conjunction with the services.  So I think we're really having a best practice in the building of reaching out from OSD and working arm-in-arm with the services on new policy so there will be no surprises.
"What we do is reserve the right at OSD, in my office, to say that a particular program is not suitable for middle-tier acquisition."
"However, I think we have learned that words are very important.  And we have not had as much message discipline in the past when talking about middle-tier.  Because you can take a subcomponent of an MDAP, whether it be a center system or something else, and you can do mid-tier acquisition on that one subsystem that can buy you a lot of time back in the program and mature it."
"The key is that we have in the policy, is to clearly articulate at the beginning of the middle-tier program what the onboarding path is back to an MDAP, if it is overall an MDAP, and when certain data will be available."
"So with all of what we do, we're being very, very data-driven.  And we've learned through just getting out there and doing it.  And recall back in April of 2018, I said that we were going to try and prototype, if you will, middle-tier acquisition and that we would, you know, learn by doing.  Well, we're in the messy middle right now.  So I think it's been very good because we've driven to the real conversations."
"So moving forward, we retain the responsibility within Acquisition and Sustainment to say whether or not a program is suitable for middle-tier acquisition."
I think we are getting capability down-range to the warfighter faster because of this.  And we need to carefully implement it.  And we continue to talk to staffers and members about how we are using it.
STAFF:  And we'll just go --
"Q:  Okay, great.  Hi.  Leigh Giangreco, Capitol Forum.  Thanks again for doing this.  Appreciate it."
"There was an interim rule that came out in April prohibiting the acquisition of certain magnets from North Korea, Russia, China and Iran.  I'm just wondering if more recently you've heard any serious concerns from industry about the ability to comply with that rule.  And if that's the case, what are the next steps?  Because correct me if I'm wrong.  My understanding is that rule is pretty much a mandate from last year, the NDAA, correct?"
MS. LORD:  Yeah.
"We continue to look at the fragility of the defense-industrial base, especially around some of the components four, five, six layers down in the chain.  And we talk with industry about where there are issues and problems."
"We're using some of the authorities Congress has given us:  DPA Title III, IBAS, (inaudible)."
Q:  (inaudible)
"MS. LORD:  So Defense Production Act, Title III.  IBAS, we will get you what that acronym is.  I'm violating my own rule here."
(Laughter.)
"But basically, these are authorities that allow us to put money into the industrial base to stand up capabilities for which there's not a clear, robust business model right now to keep the capability there for our defense purposes."
But what we've been doing is working with the implementation of the 13806 Defense Industrial Base E.O. report.  And we are getting presidential determinations that allow us to spend money against certain areas.  So we can get you a list of all the presidential determinations.  That's one way we fund it to get things going.
But we do continue to talk to the Hill about where we have concerns.  And a large focus of our industrial policy team is to make sure we do work in those areas where we need a softened processing of some of those items versus actually getting them initially.
"And again, these are things that might come into the Trusted Capital Marketplace where we need capital infusion to stand up capability."
Q:  But is there -- are you hearing any concerns from industry either about standing that up or the -- the lag time between standing that up and --
MS. LORD:  I have not personally heard about some of the other things that you mentioned.
"Q:  Hi, Lara Seligman with Foreign Policy."
"I wanted to ask just a follow up on Marcus' question and just ask you if you could elaborate maybe on some concerns that you might have on any indications of Northrop potentially having a major stake in all of the legs of the nuclear triad, whether that raises any concerns from the DOD or industrial base perspective."
And are you potentially having -- are you potentially considering having the Air Force run that program?
"MS. LORD:  Right now, again, the RFP is out, proposals are not in, so I'm not going to comment on that until we see what we get for proposals."
"Q:  And I guess related to that, to follow up then, the UTC merger that's going to be happening.  Are you -- is the -- are you considering -- is the government considering intervening?  Do you think that there will be an intervention into that, as well?  Do you see a consolidation of the industrial base?"
"MS. LORD:  Well, there's a process we go through with any of these mergers or acquisitions, and it's actually a process that I thought was a little murky on our side when I first came in."
"So we've established a process now, when we get a call or we hear in the media that a merger or acquisition is taking place, we go out with a request to all of the components and services about what business they have with each of the two companies and whether they see any problems with limiting competition where there's just two of them.  And then we partner with either the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission to step through and see if there are any issues."
"We are working through that process right now, and what we would typically do, would put consent orders in and so forth if we have concerns.  There are no major concerns that I know of right now."
STAFF:  Ryan?
"Q:  Hi, Ryan Browne, CNN."
"I just had a question about the Trusted Capital Markets and why you chose a small UAS as, kind of, the initial project there.  Is that because it was considered a high risk of an adversarial investor coming into that sector or --"
"MS. LORD:  It's because where we are right now in terms of having our entire U.S. marketplace eroded, and also because it's very intuitive, people can understand what these small quadcopters are and so forth."
"So essentially, we don't have much of a small UAS industrial base because DJI dumped so many low-price quadcopters on the markets.  And we then became dependent on them, both from the defense point of view and the commercial point of view, and we know that a lot of the information is sent back to China from those.  So it is -- it's not something that we can use."
"So number one, small UAS are important to us, so we want to rebuild that capability.  We actually have had a lot of work going on in the department about architectures for small UAS, whether they be fixed wings or quadcopters.  So we thought it was a good time to stand it up."
"Plus, if we meet our defense needs, we feel that there are simpler versions that would be very, very attractive for the commercial market, as well.  So there was a great pathway there for industry."
STAFF:  Travis?
"Q:  Yeah, I wanted to just follow up on the Trusted Capital Marketplace, as well and make sure that I understood what you were saying."
"If the -- there's not a website that would be the vehicle that would be linking venture capitalists and these small companies, then what you're saying is that the Department of Defense, in face-to-face meetings, would be linking them up.  Is that correct?"
"MS. LORD:  We are -- yes, we are going to be in different cities around the country convening groups where we would invite the capital providers, as well as the industry representatives.  We're working on who all those people are right now.  And then we would provide a mechanism for them to work with one another."
"Now, the idea is we do not promise business to any of the businesses that would be there, but these are areas where we definitely have a strong demand signal."
"What we're working on right now is how we, as DOD, can invest a little bit in many of these companies as well, so they could be branded as having DOD contracts.  We think that would be helpful."
Q:  So is it accurate to say that it does not -- something that would be stood up on a particular date but more as a -- as a process moving forward?
And were there any expectations from Congress about how you worked with these small companies?  And do you think that this would fulfill those expectations?
MS. LORD:  It will be a series of events with an ongoing process.  It's just not going to be all done through a website as we initially anticipated.
And I think Congress is extremely interested in this because it's obviously generating business as well as bringing capability to the Department of Defense.
STAFF:  Sandra?
Q:  Thank you.  Sandra Erwin with SpaceNews.
I wanted to ask you a question about the launch service procurement.  We have -- I was wondering if you've had any talks with the Air Force.  The program has come under legal challenges.  There's possibly going to be language in the NDAA.  And I'm -- I'm just curious if you think that the Air Force should be making any changes to make it more competitive.
"MS. LORD:  So, I talk to the Air Force all of the time and launch services is something that's of particular interest to us.  I think we have been very transparent and very consistent with what the process has been for launch services and we plan to continue with that."
"Now, we will see how things go and adjust as necessary, but there are no changes imminent."
Q:  Thank you.
STAFF:  Megan?
"Q:  Hi, Megan Eckstein, USNI News."
"Back to the Trusted Capital Marketplace, I wondered how long DOD plans on focusing on small UAS and then what the process is like to identify other technology areas and kind of how you may rotate through those?"
"MS. LORD:  We have a whole list of other areas.  And we would like to have a second event in January, but we plan to do this every couple of months."
STAFF:  Ashley?
"Q:  Hi, Ashley Roque with Janes."
"Since you were last year, the U.S. has withdrawn from the INF Treaty, the Navy is testing the Tomahawk with the Mk 41, the Army is considering their ATAC as its replacement."
"Is there a larger acquisition plan in place to get these types of capabilities, or is it all just sort of on the services at this point looking at the different weapons?"
"MS. LORD:  This -- we, at the department level, look at what requirements are.  That goes through the Joint Staff and then the services decide on specific programs."
"The services right now are establishing capability that each of them sees a demand for.  However, we do talk about our capability in its entirety all of the time as a group."
"We, now with the new cadence of meetings with Secretary Esper being here -- we have both the service chiefs and the service secretaries in with all of the unders every Monday morning and then on Monday afternoon.  And on Monday mornings, we talk about critical metrics and where we are on programs.  In the afternoons on Mondays, we talk strategy.  And so in both of those forums, we bring these up."
"So to answer your question, the services are doing -- are developing capability.  But the entire department is watching that.  So everything we do will be complementary and will meet one another's needs."
"We're really in this interoperable, multi-domain battle now.  You have to look at command and control and, kind of, E.W. across the entire department to go fight together."
STAFF:  Go ahead.
Q:  Andrew Clevenger with C.Q.
"Regarding the I.P. group you were talking about standing up, do you anticipate requiring any new authorities from Congress on that?"
MS. LORD:  Not that I'm aware of right now.
"Congress actually mandated it, I believe it was in the '17 NDAA, that we did stand up this intellectual property cadre.  So it is in response to legislation."
Q:  Have you gotten any feedback on your proposal or how you're moving forward?
"MS. LORD:  We've been informing the Hill all along.  We just discussed it late last week with staffers, so we have support at this point in time. We'll continue to brief."
Q:  Thank you.  Vivienne Machi with Defense Daily.  Thanks for being here.
"A quick clarification:  I'm embarrassed I missed this, but have you made a decision as to where the Turkish F-35s will go?"
MS. LORD:  That is still under discussion right now.
"Q:  And then just on the unified cyber standard, can you elaborate a little bit on what else needs to be done at this point before January 2020?  Have you already, sort of, established the format, the process?"
"MS. LORD:  We -- we have used the industry associations, PSC, NDIA, AIA, have a lot of listening sessions, if you will.  And also taking what the Navy has done some work on and then AIA had done a little bit of work, and coming up with a standard and actually going through the process of how we will apply them, what that will mean to procurement, how we have industry audited and so forth."
So we're literally going through the implementation and what it will take.
"Q:  And would there be a substantial difference for small businesses versus major contractors, or --"
"MS. LORD:  Well, I think what is particularly utilitarian about how we're doing this is there are five levels of this standard, and when you have a program, different subsystems can be held at different levels.  So in other words, the entire system doesn't require a rating of a 4.  Different parts can have a lower and then higher amount.  So if you have a hardware portion that really doesn't have a cyber-security requirement, there won't be much levied on that."
"That being said, we are extremely concerned that we support small business with this, because we know small business is where most of our innovation comes from.  So to that end, we've been encouraging small businesses to work with the industry associations to learn about it."
We -- I always think of our industrial policy team as the big help desk for DOD.  So I'm hoping that industry will call in where they have challenges.  Our small business group is particularly focused on it.  So we are trying to help people help themselves and work with us.
"Q:  Kasim Ileri, Anadolu Agency."
"Part of my question was asked, of course.  But Turkish jets, what are -- as they are still Turkish property, what are the Turkish -- what is being done with those Turkish jets at Luke?  Where are they now?"
MS. LORD:  They are still at Luke.  And we are working through a variety of different courses of action right now on how we work through that.
Q:  And when do you think the formal removal procedure will be completed and (inaudible) Turkey?
"MS. LORD:  I -- we are thinking about a year from now, as we work through the production, sustainment and follow-on development memorandum of understanding, which is the overarching document for the partnership."
STAFF:  Rafael?
Q:  Hi.  Good afternoon.  My name is Rafael Salido from Efe News.  Thanks for doing this.
"I was wondering, we've been talking about China.  As I'm sure you're aware, China controls the -- the market of the rare earth with our (inaudible) component.  Is the DOD concerned that this escalation between China and the U.S. may affect the -- your military power?  And what is -- what is the DOD doing to (inaudible)?"
"MS. LORD:  We have been focused on rare earths for quite some time.  In fact, that was one of the findings of the 13806 report.  And in fact, we have several -- I think we have five presidential determinations right now on rare earths."
"The challenge is really the processing of them and having facilities to do that.  Because quite often, China mines them elsewhere and brings them back to China to process them."
"So we are looking at a variety of mechanisms to stand up processing facilities.  One, I think, of the highest potential avenues is to work with Australia.  When I was in Australia this summer, we had discussions about rare earths and whether or not we could work with Australia to stand up a facility that would take care of our DOD needs, but a variety of other international needs, as well.  So a variety of avenues we're pursuing."
Q:  So -- so the DOD is concerned about the escalation between both countries?
"MS. LORD:  We're concerned about any fragility in the supply chain, and especially where an adversary controls the supply."
STAFF:  Jack?
Q:  Jack Detsch with Al-Monitor.
Can you tell us if there's been any impact from the F-35 removal -- program removal on Turkey's FMS cases -- any other FMS cases they have with the U.S.?
"MS. LORD:  We are keeping the F-35 in Turkey separate and distinct from any other activities with Turkey.  It was very clearly an S-400 issue with F-35, and outside of that, if we were going to talk about CAATSA sanctions and so forth, State Department has the lead on that, separate and distinct."
"Q:  So -- and at this point, can you say that the process towards the removal of Turkey from the F-35 program, is that now irreversible?  Because I don't think we had clarity on that in July."
"MS. LORD:  The S-400 and the F-35 are incompatible.  Turkey is a strategic ally of ours, a strategic partner for us, so we always continue to talk."
STAFF: Lalit?
"Q:  Lalit Jha, PTI."
"Two summers ago, U.S. had acknowledged that it will sell Sea Guardian drones to India.  What is the status of that?  When do you think you will have them?"
"MS. LORD:  We continue to work with India on that.  That's under the framework of DTTI, the Defense Technology and trade initiative, I think.  We can check on that acronym for you."
"Ajay Kumar was just over here about a month ago, and we continue to work through that.  I can get you some updates on it, if you're interested."
"Q:  Yeah, if you can get us some (inaudible)."
"MS. LORD:  Yes, we can take that."
STAFF:  Back row.
"My question is in regard to Japan and the F-35, preventing the movement on their request to be a formal partner.  And then, are they in line to receive any of the work that is available now with Turkey's exit from the program?"
"MS. LORD:  Japan is an FMS customer.  The partnership actually closed to any other partners in 2002, and was formally documented in 2004 because of the money all the partners had paid in to that time.  So there is not a partnership opportunity for any of the other countries."
"That being said, we continue to work with all of our FMS customers on their concerns and what they think they'll get as a benefit from that.  If you recall, we did have a FACO, a final assembly and checkout, facility in Japan that they are balancing down a little bit now."
"But very, very important to us.  We continue to work closely with them."
"Q:  Nothing in terms of new -- new work outside of the FACO facility, as in regards to Turkey's exit?  There's nothing --"
"MS. LORD:  Initially, those 900-plus parts, we are sourcing all in the U.S. because the U.S. is paying all the nonrecurring engineering, and we made the decision to pull out while Turkey -- talking with our partners.  So we said, to be expeditious and keep the program on track, we were going to source all of those parts initially in the U.S."
"That being said, competition is our friend, and we're always looking for more strong, integrated supply chain partners, so there's always the possibility."
STAFF:  Right here.  Go ahead.
Q:  Hi.  Brian (inaudible) with Reuters.
Can you speak to the conversations about building on that American supply chain for the small UAS market?  I know that's been an issue because a lot of the parts are coming from China in small drones.  So how large is DOD's UAS program?  How many are you acquiring each year?
MS. LORD:  Yeah.  I have the data.  I don't have it with me.  We can get that for you.
"But what we would like to have are U.S. designers and manufacturers of small UAS, because not only do we have a need for that in the Department of Defense, we know it's a very, very large commercial industry.  So we think that we can catalyze that activity and have a safe and secure supply."
"Q:  And I know Senator Murphy put in a provision into the NDAA about banning an all-Chinese drone -- software, parts, all of that.  Did he have any conversations with you or your department about that?"
"MS. LORD:  Actually, (inaudible) Murphy's a great partner for us.  Is that who you're talking about?"
Q:  Senator Chris Murphy (inaudible).
"MS. LORD:  Oh, I'm sorry."
"We -- I have not, but my team has, and we continue to look at entity lists and so forth.  Right now, I'm not aware of anything above -- beyond DJI."
"Q:  But is it a concern to be able to comply with the, you know -- there's no software and no parts, no nothing from Chinese?  I mean, this is -- just how long until you're going to be able to comply with that without applying for a waiver?"
"MS. LORD:  Well, we do have a waiver process right now, I think, as you know, and that's why we want to get this Trusted Marketplace going, is to make sure we understand where we might have any gaps."
STAFF:  Do you have any closing comments?
MS. LORD:  No.  Just appreciate everyone taking the time to come and talk.  We will be back next month to talk F-35.  Thank you.
"STAFF:  Thanks, everybody.  Have a good day."

"*Small business
** Woman-owned small business"
MR. DEASY:  Good morning.  
"So as Elissa said, I’m Dana Deasy.  So I have overall responsibility for the DOD CIO [Chief Information Officer] activities across the Department of Defense as, I think, some of you have written in the past.  One of the major programs I lead is the digital modernization for the overall Department of Defense, which has four key components to it.  One of those is cloud; the others being A.I. [Artificial Intelligence] -- which is why Gen. Shanahan's here with me -- as well as next generation command control communications, as well as cyber.  I always like to point that out because our cloud strategy sits as part of much broader digital modernization program.  "
"We wanted to bring you all together today to give you an update on where we are at on the overall program, and have a couple of very specific conversations today, the first one of which is the recent announcement that has come out in the press regarding Secretary Esper.  As you know, he assumed his role as secretary of Department of Defense approximately three weeks ago, and you have all heard that in assuming that role, one of the things he has said is that he is going to personally take a hard look at the overall JEDI [Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure] program. "
"The other thing I want to -- I'll talk more about that in a minute.  The other one is there's a lot of narratives going on, on JEDI, and what we wanted to do today was kind of set the record straight on some of these narratives.  There is a couple of really key narratives in there, and I'm going to walk you through those narratives, and then that's going to get to the conversation on the warfighter."
"So first on Secretary Esper.  So Secretary Esper made a commitment during his confirmation hearing that he would take a look at the overall JEDI program.  People have picked up this word, quote, ""pause"".  There is not a pause on the overall JEDI program, meaning that we are still a number of weeks away from completion of the overall evaluation.  Now, some of you are going to ask about the fact that I had stated earlier that we were looking towards a date in August, and I've always used the expression ""not earlier than August"".  "
"Because a lot of our attention and time has been placed on the Federal Claims Court, which you know we came out with a very positive ruling on that.  We are now able to pivot our full attention, the energy of everybody's time and efforts back towards the completion of the evaluation.  It's a highly-technical evaluation at this point that we are going through with the finals.  That still is going to take a number of weeks to complete, so therefore, the continuation of the JEDI evaluation work has not been paused.  That work continues on."
What is occurring is Secretary Esper has asked to go through a series of sessions to fully comprehend the overall JEDI program.  I want to give you some real specifics as to what's going to be taking place over the next several weeks.
"So we have put together a series of education programs that allow him to get deep understanding.  As you can imagine, when he was secretary of Army, in that role he was aware of the JEDI program, but in that capacity he did not have to have a complete, deep understanding.  In his new role, given that this is a large acquisition program, you would expect any new secretary taking over the DOD to want to have a -- a strong understanding of any major acquisition program.  So that's exactly what we're doing here. "
"So some of the things we're going to be discussing with him over the next several weeks is why does the DOD need an enterprise cloud?  We're going to get into a deep conversation of what are the activities we're trying to solve for, what is the urgency around this, how to support the warfighter.  "
"We're going to get more into that conversation with Gen. Shanahan today.  What are the security implications, how does this help the security standpoint, what are the securities from a commercial cloud standpoint, et cetera.  So we're going to have a session around that. "
"Then we're going to follow on sessions around, how does JEDI fit into a much larger overall Department of -- Department of Defense enterprise cloud strategy?  That is a mouthful.  So we're going to explain to him, what is the overall strategy for the Department of Defense when it comes to enterprise cloud?  Where does JEDI fit into the much larger strategy?  And we're going to have a bunch of questions I'm sure we'll go back and forth with on that.  "
"And then finally, we're going to have a deep set of discussions on the JEDI program itself.  How was it created, who were all the people involved, what were the things that we needed to consider bringing into an RFP [request for proposal] process, how was that constructed, what's the selection criteria. "
"And you can imagine, there will be probably a series of follow-on questions and actions out of that.  This is going to be an iterative process.  You're going to see, we're going to start very high and then we're going to go into a lot of very specifics.  "
"He needs this because he obviously has a role, to weigh into the overall direction of this program.  And for him to be able to do that, he needs to first go through a series of deep education sessions.  So that's what we'll be doing with him over the next number of weeks.  While, in parallel, we are still continuing through the technical evaluation process as part of our overall source selection. "
"Two, out on the DOD website, we put out what is called the Enterprise Cloud Fact Sheet.  I think this went up sometime here in the last 24 hours, that's available to all of you."
"And what -- why have we done that?  So there has been, I mentioned earlier, a number of narratives that have been picked up in the media, about the cloud program.  What we've tried to do is literally take those narratives, and have put facts behind them. 
Let me just give you one such example.  One of the narratives says that the DOD is doing a single cloud, that we're going to pick a vendor that's going to run all the DOD cloud.  It's going to receive a $10 billion award and they're getting a 10-year contract.  So that's a narrative that's out there."
"The fact is, we already, today, have a number of clouds.  We're already spending well in excess of half a billion dollars annually on a multiple number of clouds inside the Department of Defense.  "
"The winner of this actually receives $1 million, not $10 billion.  It is a two-year contract with a three-year --- three-year plus two-year extension.  And so if you were to execute all the extensions, and if we were to pivot workloads, we believe it could, over a 10-year period, generate up to $10 billion."
But in no way is this is a $10 billion cloud.  It is technically a $1 million award with a two-year contract with extensions that follow on.  That will be complementary to other cloud awards that we will continue to do across the Department of Defense.
"Finally, the last narrative that continues to get a lot of play is, this is not in the best interest of the warfighter.  So today, what we want to cover is setting the record straight, that the warfighter is absolutely waiting for this.  This is an imperative to what they need, each and every day, to defend and to execute their missions. "
"And to that end, I've asked Gen. Shanahan to join today.  As you know, Gen. Shanahan heads up A.I. for the Department of Defense, the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center.  What he's going to do is, spend some time walking you through why this matters to the warfighter. "
"LIEUTENANT GENERAL JACK SHANAHAN:  Well, thanks.  "
"Good morning to everybody, for those who don't already know me.  I'm Lt. Gen. Jack Shanahan, the director of the Joint A.I. Center, or the JAIC.  And before that, I was -- served as the director of Project Maven under the under secretary of defense for intelligence. "
"The warfighter needed enterprise cloud yesterday.  Dominance in A.I. is not a question of software engineering.  But instead, it's the result of combining capabilities at multiple levels: code, data, compute and continuous integration and continuous delivery.  All of these require the provisioning of hyper-scale commercial cloud. "
"For A.I. across DOD, enterprise cloud is existential.  Without enterprise cloud, there is no A.I. at scale.  A.I. will remain a series of small-scale stovepipe projects with little to no means to make A.I. available or useful to warfighters.  That is, it will be too hard to develop, secure, update and use in the field. "
"JEDI will provide on-demand, elastic compute at scale, data at scale, substantial network and transport advantages, DevOps and a secure operating environment at all classification levels."
"I can speak from three years of personal experience as the lead for Project Maven, and now as the director of the JAIC.  While we moved fast in Project Maven, delivering the first A.I. capabilities to a combat theater within six months of standing up, there is no question whatsoever that both Maven and the JAIC would be much further along right now with A.I. fielding, had we had an enterprise cloud solution in place as originally scheduled. "
"We have spent far too much time, over the past two years, striving to gain access to data for training our algorithms, updating fielded models, site by site, deriving ad-hoc solutions to bring real-world data back to allow dynamic retraining of fielded models, and cobbling together one-off, bespoke cloud solutions to meet mission requirements. "
"For these reasons and more, both Maven and the JAIC plan to be among the very first projects to migrate to JEDI. "
"Enterprise cloud provides a solution for the deployment of software and A.I., enabling instantaneous and continuous deployment of updates to a global enterprise.  A single instance of an A.I. application can be used by an entire enterprise, and updated for all at the same time."
"An enterprise cloud allows A.I. cycle speeds that can be measured in updates and across an entire enterprise in hours as opposed to in months, six months or maybe even a year. "
"The ability to run entire A.I. pipelines in the cloud will be critical for success.  From data acquisition to labeling, continuous training, test and evaluation, integration, deployment and even as far as human-machine teaming with continuous dynamic feedback. "
"The top A.I. companies are, first and foremost, cloud, data-centric organizations with a continuous development culture where integrating, managing and analyzing data at scale is the lifeblood of the organization.  That's where we want to be and need to be with our enterprise cloud solution. "
"The Joint Common Foundation, or JCF, as part of the JAIC that we're building, that is going to be an enterprise cloud environment.  It's a platform that will provide data, tools, environments and access to other certified platforms, to enable software and A.I. engineers to rapidly develop, evaluate, test and deploy A.I.-enhanced solutions to the warfighter. "
"The JCF is designed to lower the barriers to entry, democratize access to data, eliminate duplicative efforts and increase value added.  That platform will reside on top of the JEDI infrastructure. "
"JEDI will include cloud capabilities that are able to operate out of standalone portable hardware even in the absence of communications links.  It will resynch with the rest of the JEDI cloud as soon as communications are restored.  This hub-and-spoke model means that local military equipment that is connected to the JEDI cloud hardware could still operate and be used to execute missions in a degraded, disrupted or a denied environment, extending enterprise cloud, in other words, all the way out to the tactical edge. "
"And finally, this is not merely an A.I. issue; It is also about joint all-domain war fighting, taking advantage of emerging technologies to develop new operating concepts for a kind of warfare that will look completely different than what we've experienced for the past 20 years."
"In this future high-end fight we envision a world of algorithmic warfare and autonomy where competitive advantage goes to the side that understands how to harness 5G, A.I., enterprise cloud and quantum, when quantum's available, into a viable operational model, all part of the department's transformation from a hardware -- hardware-centric to an all-domain digital force.  This digital more -- modernization is a war-fighting imperative that demands a palpable sense of urgency, and it's one that will be fueled by an enterprise cloud solution."
"So with that said, I think we can turn it over for questions."
STAFF:  We can start from here. 
"Q:  Okay. Thanks, Patrick Tucker from Defense One."
"There's been a lot of public speculation lately, in part because of the president's Twitter feed, and also because things that you see on some news channels that -- people urging the president of the United States to personally intervene in this contract and cancel it.  So without getting into the politics of it, can you tell us what would happen in the event that JEDI were, by fiat or for some other reason, the program was canceled before being awarded, or asked to recompete?  Like, what would be the effects of those two, however unlikely, eventualities?"
"MR DEASY:  So all I can say is it is our job right now to educate the secretary as to why we need a cloud.  In doing so, we will make it very clear as to what it means to the warfighter, what it means to even, you could say, efficiencies across the Pentagon.  "
"In having that conversation, he will have a good understanding of what are the consequences, honestly, if we were to take a decision not to continue with JEDI.  But I can't speculate today, nor would it be appropriate for me to try to describe those consequences."
Q:  Okay.  How have -- can you give us a sense of how he would get a sense of the consequences?  (inaudible)
"MR. DEASY:  So I'll -- I'll -- I'll -- so what we're going to do over the next several weeks is we are actually going to bring people in to these sessions.  So we're going to bring warfighters in.  We're going to bring the military services in.  We're going to bring combatant command participants in.  For example, U.S. Cyber Command, and we're going to bring technical and legal experts in, as well. "
"So part of the education -- you know, I always believe that some of the best way you educate is to make it real world, and so we're going to bring people that can talk about the real-world implications and the importance of the cloud.  So that's how we're going to bring it to life for him.  "
STAFF:  (inaudible)
"Q:  Oh, yes, so in the -- at the beginning you mentioned your previous comments about August being the early -- the earliest.  Do you still -- is that -- is it still possible for August, or are you now going..."
"MR. DEASY:  No, as I said, you know, you have to remember how many months we were tied up on the federal claims side of that, which redirected a lot of energy and a lot of people's attention towards that.  Obviously, very pleased with the outcome of that.  But that work, necessary to do that, has caused us to have to, you know, spend now additional time to complete the evaluation process. "
"One thing I've been consistent on from the beginning is, we've got to get this right.  So we are not going to rush to a decision.  We're going to spend whatever time that the evaluation team needs to spend, to make sure we are picking the best technical solution at the right price with the right delivery criteria that will meet the needs of the warfighter.  "
"And we already know, in looking at the timeline, what it's going to take to accomplish that, that we are going to go past the end of August."
"Q:  Justin Doubleday, Inside Defense.  "
"You mentioned these sessions in terms -- you said weeks, weeks-long.  Do you have a schedule?  Can you say kind of like, you know, four weeks from now, you'll be done with this schedule of sessions?  Or what's the schedule? "
"MR. DEASY:  So we have an outline, and I walked you through the outline.  What I believe will happen, just like any learnings happen, is that we will take him through, he will ask a number of questions, he will probably even ask a number of action items.  And we'll take out of that meeting, we will bring those back.  And this will be an iterative process. "
"So right now, the reason I'm not going to try to predict an end date, it's all going to be to the level of depth we go into, to the number of follow-up questions and follow-up actions he'll give us.  And that's why it would not be appropriate to try to put a guesstimation on when that will complete. "
"Q:  Okay.  And when you came into the department last year, I think you also did your own review of the JEDI cloud program.  And I'm wondering, what were you looking at?  What did you find during that review? "
"MR. DEASY:  Yeah.  What I was looking for, was stepping back – saying okay, tell me how you went through the process of gathering requirements.  You know, how -- what -- what was the basis for this RFP.  And so a lot of time I spent earlier, I was understanding just that.  What was the warfighter requirement, what was the tactical edge requirement, how was it that programs like Maven was going to use it. "
"Spent a substantial amount of time, understanding the security implications.  How was it, we were going to set up this.  What were the security requirements we were putting into the RFP.  Spent a lot of time, understanding how were we organized to actually do the RFP.  "
"How were we organized -- because you know, obviously, this was a new process for me, joining the Department of Defense.  How does the acquisition process work, what was the timeline for that, what was our selection criteria.  So those would be the things that I was looking at when I came on board. "
STAFF:  Do you have anything (inaudible)? 
Q:  Yes.  Emily Birnbaum with The Hill newspaper.  
"First question would be, are -- do you think that you're going to bring in the top contenders, the companies AWS [Amazon Web Services] and Microsoft?  And the second question would be, could you offer some examples as to how this cloud solution is going to help on the battlefield, just..."
MR. DEASY:  Sure. 
Q:  ... some like little illustrations. 
"MR. DEASY:  I'll let Gen. Shanahan handle the second part of that.  To the first one, when you say, ""Bring in""..."
Q:  During this review process. 
"MR. DEASY:  You mean to participate in the review?  No, absolutely not.  We -- we -- you should -- I should stress that we need to keep these processes separate.  Educating the secretary is one process, so he can weigh in and be informed in the direction he wants to go forward with this, which is separate from the sourcing selection process.  So those will be run separately. "
"LT. GEN. SHANAHAN:  On the other side, so yesterday, I took -- I stay very closely connected to Maven, still.  And I got my -- an update yesterday.  And we were talking about Afghanistan.  And when I -- and I can't get into a lot of specifics in here, but the case they have is they're -- they're -- they're developing something called ""smart system"" in Project Maven, which is an A.I.-enabled ops-intel [operations-intelligence] fusion system along with another system that Special Operations Command is using on the operations side, how -- showing how you can bring ops and intel together.  "
"And the op tempo, the pace of operations in Afghanistan is so -- it's higher than it's been in an awful long time right now, and they were giving me very concrete examples of downrange using these capabilities.  But the -- the more they're using them, the more data they need, the more data they're actually pulling off the battlefield.  But there are specific instances of having to get all of this data -- there's no common data fabric.  Somebody has to actually clean that data, and if they want to use that to help then retrain the algorithm that's been fielded, they've got to do a bunch of steps to it.  They don't have time to do that.  It's -- it's site-by-site, and one of the task forces in a different location is bringing enormously important information and data, but there's no simple way to share that with another part of -- of Afghanistan, or another part of the task force.  An enterprise cloud solution helps address all of that.  That's one piece of it."
"And to get even, let's say, more specific and to a place where JEDI is -- or enterprise cloud is fully fielded, that hub-and-spoke model -- let's say you have the central JEDI cloud, then you have, maybe, portable data centers that are downrange, a little bit -- you know, a bit bigger than sort of, you know, a breadbox, think CONEX [container express].  And then all the way down to a portable, truly, two-man portable cloud compute solution that anybody could stay connected to.  "
"The beauty of that is not only are you getting access to -- to all the benefits of the cloud down to the very edge of the battlefield; as you're collecting data, that data can then go back into that portable cloud, connect to the big CONEX all the way back to -- to the cloud, so everybody is benefiting from that.  And if you get disconnected, as is going to happen in combat, especially in a high-end fight, you still have what you had at the point it was disconnected.  When it suddenly comes back, you have all of this now being -- being connected across the entire enterprise."
"So it's really -- it -- it really gives people access to more data, better data, faster data than one-off each site’s trying to come up with their own solutions.  That's a -- that's my quickest example that I can give you.  "
"MR. DEASY:  Yeah, I'll add one thing onto that.  It's interesting.  As I've gone out -- after joining the Department of Defense I had a chance to go out and meet with just about all the combatant commands, and they'll walk me through, obviously, their technical challenges they're faced with.  And I will point out, I'll say, ""But we have a -- a number of clouds.""  And I made a comment earlier at the beginning of this today.  We are not short on clouds in the Department of Defense, and that somehow has gotten lost in this narrative.  And they'll say, ""Yeah, but we don't have an enterprise approach.  We have a bunch of siloed solutions we built.  We have lots of vendors we're using for cloud solutions, but we've never stepped back and created a holistic solution.""  And that is -- that is causing challenges out in the field."
"I've been invited, for example, some time over the next several weeks I will -- I will be going to Afghanistan, and the reason they want me to come out and spend some time with the forces is to actually see the problem of what he was -- what Gen. Shanahan was referring to by having siloed data, by having these clouds that have not been connected up in an enterprise manner -- to actually see how it's impacting the warfighter."
Q:  Good morning.  Thanks for doing this.  Amanda with CNBC.  
"Sir, can you say if this is a break with bureaucratic process of awarding a contract?"
MR. DEASY:  I'm not sure I follow.
"Q:  So right now, with this particular contract, is it a break with the normal bureaucratic process of (inaudible)"
"MR. DEASY:  No, and the reason I say that is we have not stopped our selection process.  I think what JEDI is going through is common to other large programs.  You're going to have protests.  You're going to have -- you're going to have people that are going to weigh in.  We have a new secretary.  And as I said earlier, I would absolutely expect him, on a program of this scale, to want to completely understand that.  "
"It's not a break from the standpoint -- we got work to do, we're continuing with that.  We're not stopping anything.  While, at the same time, we are educating the new secretary on this. "
Q:  Is there anything else in your portfolio that you're aware of that Secretary Esper's going to get a deep...education session…
"MR. DEASY:  Yeah, so I mentioned up-front, that we have this digital modernization program that consists of cloud as a foundation, A.I. as an enabler, C3 -- command, control, communications -- next generation of that, and finally, cyber."
"He is going to have a series of ongoing deep dives across all four of those portfolios.  So actually, all we're doing is we're accelerating his deep dive on the cloud.  "
"But we've got, coming up in the next month or two, a deep dive, for example, on the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center.  We just did one a number of weeks ago on command and control and communications.  So this is just one of a series of deep dives.  "
"Q:  Aaron Gregg with The Washington Post.  Based on your conversations with Secretary Esper, is amending the RFP to go multi-cloud for JEDI, something that's on the table?  And do you have the workforce in place to implement that? "
"MR. DEASY:  So, right now, we have not modified, changed anything in the work we are doing on JEDI.  We are still proceeding through the sourcing -- selection -- source selection process. "
"All we are doing with Secretary Esper is educating him through that outline that I shared before.  At the end of this process, he will obviously be at a point and a position to weigh in with his thoughts and views on this.  We obviously will need to incorporate his thoughts and views on that at that time. "
"But at this point, no, there is no changes to the direction.  The only thing we are doing is educating the new secretary while completing the evaluation program. "
STAFF:  (inaudible). 
"Q:  I've got a couple questions.  How come you all didn't do this sooner?  I feel like this would've been a thing you could have done months ago that would have helped quell the rash of misinformation, disinformation out there.  So what precipitated this...."
(CROSSTALK)
"MR. DEASY:  Yeah, I will -- I will tell you, one of the things that we have to delicately balance is the source selection process, and what you should and should not say publicly when you are in the middle of a source selection process.  You're dealing with that. "
"More importantly, when the protests started and we went through the whole series of the GAO [Government Accountability Office] review and then the Federal Claims Court review, during that time, we have to -- we have to be very careful about not getting ahead of or interfering with either of those types of processes. "
"So it would have been inappropriate for us, in the middle of those, you know, GAO and Federal Claims Court processes, to have had the conversation we're having today. "
"Q:  Sure.  And Mr. Shanahan, on -- one of the examples you gave when you were talking earlier, was about the deployment of algorithms across DOD's hundreds -- probably, or more -- networks.  Do you have other examples?  You talked a little bit about the tactical edge, but where JEDI would just basically crush whatever systems, processes you have now and make you guys more lethal? "
"I think that's something that gets buried a little bit in some of the other stuff that comes up, but it's hugely important for explaining why we need this enterprise-wide cloud.  If there are other examples you can share, I'd be happy to hear it. "
"LT. GEN. SHANAHAN:  Well, a couple of thoughts.  Day-to-day, my main interest, of course, is in A.I. because of the position I have, the position I held before.  And I've been down this path long enough and far enough to know, you cannot get to true enterprise A.I. solutions without an enterprise cloud.  That's what the biggest -- biggest AI companies are doing exactly that, just tend to do -- they also tend to be the biggest cloud companies and there's a lot of reasons for that."
"But just the entire pipeline -- and -- and I just remember the days of -- of Colonel Cukor who led Project Maven sending a crew site by site by site to install that first algorithm, but even worse, having to go back site by site to then put updates into that."
"And then how do we get the real world data back to make that algorithm better?  Because it always -- it always will change based on real world data, but that will all be made so much better, so much faster, so easier with an enterprise cloud solution."
"It's not -- it's not going to completely eliminate the challenges but it gets a long way there.  But just in general to -- to your -- kind of the broader question here is any war fighting operation period having an enterprise cloud solution that has -- that allows interoperability -- right now, there are questions of cloud A is not interoperable with cloud B, what does it take to make that happen?  How do I get data from over here to data over here?"
"I think we're seeing real tangible examples of that playing out in Afghanistan right now and that's in a fight that we're largely calling counter -- counter-terrorism, counter-insurgency.  Imagine the speed of operations in a fight in the -- in the Pacific where you just do not have time to figure out how do I get my data, clean my data, move it from point A to point B?"
"If I am a warfighter, I want as much data as you could possibly give me, let me use my sort of algorithms to sort through it as fast as -- as -- at machine speeds, let the machines do that but the humans think, the cognitive piece of this."
"I -- it's really hard for me to do that without -- without an enterprise cloud solution.  I mean everybody is exploring different sort of cloud solutions, but again, they're -- they're tend to be bespoke and what we're looking for is a joint enterprise solution."
"The whole idea of joint all domain command and control which the joint staff J-6 has now been chartered to lead across functional team, that is going to rest on the backbone of a, you know, enterprise cloud solution."
"Q:  And just -- just really quick, the -- the -- the point about adversaries ramping up their investment, we've seen China do this with investing $10 billion recently in their own A.I. efforts.  I wonder how important if you can -- qualify how this compares to other adversaries that we're dealing with now and how that ..."
"LT. GEN. SHANAHAN:  We don't want to waste any more time moving forward because we know our potential adversaries are -- are doing it at -- at their own speed, whether it's Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, SenseTime, they're all coming up with their own cloud solutions and -- and then don't get me wrong, I don't want to make them 1,000 feet tall, they're going to have their own cloud interoperability challenges."
"But the level of investment and the number of people they're putting at the problem, they're moving at a very rapid pace and what I can't afford to do is slow down anymore.  We -- we -- we want to move equally fast and actually outpace them and they do -- they -- they're taking a very similar approach, they know the importance of an enterprise cloud solution to what they're doing with artificial intelligence."
"And Russia's not -- not that far behind, a little bit different approach in how they do it, but in general, your point is well taken that we've got to -- we've got to keep our speed up."
"MR. DEASY:  I want to bring this to light, you asked a question about how -- what this could really be as far as a game changer.  So just think about your own personal iPhone or Android device.  You get updates almost daily and that's because you're all connected to a cloud and those updates can be pushed down to you."
"Think about something like Maven today and all of the various sites that we're now starting to put that out on.  And as we start to have new warfighter upgrades, new capability that help them in the fight, think about how we have to push that out today."
"Because they sit on all different platforms, different clouds, not integrated.  Think how slow those upgrades go.  Think about if they were all on the enterprise cloud.  Now we can push out a new update to the warfighter and they can get it instantaneously, versus the approach we have to take today because we have so many disparate clouds.  "
Q:  Good morning.  Ryan Tracy with the Wall Street Journal.  
"What is the role of the commander-in-chief in deciding the future of this contract?  And also, why, for at least the first two years and the minimum $1 million, are you choosing a single awardee?"
"MR. DEASY:  So we hoped today, just through all the examples we've talked about with the warfighter and the disconnected, siloed data non-integrated clouds, that that's very apparent that the enterprise cloud is trying to solve for the fact today we cannot give the warfighter the data they need on the battlefield in an integrated way, updated application capability in real-time.  We have to learn how to do that.  This is not going to be the only cloud we're going to have across the Department of Defense.  We are always going to have a number of clouds, but to do enterprise cloud at scale all the way out to the disconnected warfighter."
"Remember what he – Gen. Shanahan said.  You've got to have cloud, and you're going to have a forward command, and then you're going to have the disconnected warfighter.  We have to learn how to start to integrate that, and then over time, we will bring more and more cloud providers into that."
Your other question about...
Q:  What is the role of the commander-in-chief in deciding the future of this contract's program?
"MR. DEASY:  So there is a separate team that is responsible for the technical selection of the outcome of who we're going to use, and that provider.  That is separate.  His role is to fully understand why we need a cloud, why this approach, and that we have done this approach in the right, appropriate manner.  And then his role is to look at that and decide if any changes to that approach needs to take place.  That is his role here."
Q:  So he could have a role in deciding whether it goes forward or not.  
LT. GEN. SHANAHAN:  Does the commander-in-chief...
"Q:  The commander-in-chief -- I'm sorry, not -- not the secretary."
"MR. DEASY:  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm thinking secretary."
Q:  I’m asking about the president.  Sorry.  What -- what's the role of the president...
MR. DEASY:  None.
Q:  ... in deciding the future of this contract?
MR. DEASY:  Not -- not in this particular contract.  I'm sorry.  I was thinking...
"LT. GEN. SHANAHAN:  Secretary, yeah."
"MR. DEASY:  Secretary.  You guys are probably all going, ""What is he saying?"" (Laughter.)"
LT. GEN. SHANAHAN:  That would have (inaudible)
MR. DEASY:  No.
(LT. GEN. SHANAHAN ?):  Because -- yeah.
MR. DEASY:  Let me be perfectly clear. I was referring to Secretary Esper in all that.  As far as the commander-in-chief -- not involved in source selection process and not involved in all of these efforts that we are doing with Secretary Esper. 
"Q:  Could he -- you know, he is the commander-in-chief.  I mean, could he say -- could he give an order to -- change it and -- you know, how does that work?"
MR. DEASY:  I -- I would not be in a position to...
MR. DEASY:  ... speculate on that. 
"Q:  Jacqueline Feldscher with Politico.  Given the president's apparent interest in this, has there been any thought here at the Pentagon or any requests from the White House to do these sort of education sessions with someone at the White House, in addition to Secretary Esper?"
"MR. DEASY:  So you should know that for several months now, one of the roles that I played, as to leading this, is to go out and offer education sessions to a number of people across government.  So I continue when asked.  We'll field calls from Congress.  I will go over and meet staffers.  I will meet with whomever is asking to get more education on this.  "
"So for the last -- let's see, I've been here now, what?  Not quite a year and a half -- I have been giving ongoing education sessions – to people as they've asked for them."
"Q:  And so if the -- the source selection review process finishes before Esper's education sessions are done, will you award the contract while these sessions with Esper are still ongoing?"
"MR. DEASY:  No, we will not.  Obviously, we -- we'd need to ensure that he is fully-educated.  Right now, that hypothetical question is highly doubtful we'll even find ourselves in that situation."
"Q:  A couple Esper questions, and then for general.  As part of the transparency effort here under Esper, did he approved today's session and the fact sheet you put out?  Realizing he's been in Mongolia with horses but)."
"MR. DEASY:  No, did we -- did I personally sit down with him and discuss the nature of what we were going to go through?  No.  You know, did I say to him when we first met, ""Sir, I believe we need to have further discussions with the press.  We need to clarify some of the myths that are going on out there, especially around the importance of this to the warfighter.""?  I said, ""Absolutely, we need to do that.""  But did he go through this narrative today?  Absolutely did…did not.  "
Q:  But he approved you going out to -- and conceptually doing this?
MR. DEASY:  He -- he is supportive of educating everybody on what it is we're trying to achieve here and the importance of the cloud.  
"Q:  Now, overlaying all this is an enigma wrapped in a cloud -- the I.G. [inspector general] investigation.  Whatever they're doing, they have been -- they've been cagey on this.  It's ethical -- or violations, or whatever.  But to what extent is that a pacing factor?  Do you need some clarity end -- end report like, the Shanahan-Boeing report before you can..."
MR. DEASY:  Right.
Q:  ... with a -- an award?
"MR. DEASY:  So on that front, what I've said in -- consistently in -- in talks with Secretary Esper is the fact that before we take any final decision, we will obviously consult with the I.G. on this.  I mean, our role right now is to let the I.G. -- you know, they need to be independent.  They need to complete their process.  But if we get to the point where we do not have an I.G. report, before we would issue any final award, we will obviously have a conversation with the I.G.  We will consult with them and in having that consultation, decide if there's anything that they're sharing with us that would give us reason to pause before it can continue on with award."
"Q:  Okay, that's fine.  General, on the -- can you real-world example?"
LT. GEN. SHANAHAN:  Yup.
"Q:  The world is fixated on Iran right now, and the Persian Gulf.  To what extent would a enterprise cloud help CENTCOM [U.S. Central Command] cobble together -- you know, NAV Fifth Fleet, Air Force's Central Command, ships in the region, commercial traffic -- I mean, how would it help share information?"
"LT. GEN. SHANAHAN:  Yeah.  Yeah, I would even make it more -- broader than that statement, is any combatant command in the world would be better connected with an enterprise cloud solution.  So rather than -- rather than -- we -- we tend, just the way we've been operating absent a -- an enterprise cloud -- so these individual clouds -- even when we have individual cloud solutions, right?  We're just getting into a world of that, versus stack by stack, hardware stacks somewhere downrange.  The idea of putting that together so different -- different fleets can communicate, different air forces, Air Force communicates with fleets, communicates with -- with divisions.  Yes, all made -- all made better by the ability to have an enterprise cloud solution.  "
Q:  So...
"LT. GEN. SHANAHAN:  And -- and I would say, you know, of course CENTCOM, but I wouldn't limit it to CENTCOM.  This is a global combatant command, warfighter requirement that Gen. B.J. Shwedo talked about, Joint Staff J-6..."
Q:  Yeah.
"LT. GEN. SHANAHAN:  ... when it was -- is when he was talking about the importance of JEDI to warfighters.  Same point that he made.  This is something that everybody will benefit from, and dare I say it?  That INDOPACOM [U.S. Indo-Pacific Command] maneuvering units can talk to CENTCOM maneuvering units through an enterprise cloud solution, which I say is not a trivial task, unfortunately."
"Q:  Could I ask you, is Maven -- you mentioned, it's being moved -- is Maven being transported also to the CENTCOM region, the AOR [area of responsibility]? "
LT. GEN. SHANAHAN:  Yes. 
"Q:  Iran region, the Iran"
"LT. GEN. SHANAHAN:  Well, Maven is in the entire Middle East region right now, in deployed locations. "
Q:  Part of this expansion...
Q:  ... Mr. Deasy? 
LT. GEN. SHANAHAN:  Yes.  
Q:  Interesting story in itself. 
"LT. GEN. SHANAHAN:  Yes.  And so the very -- very briefly sort of, just to put a couple of these things together, is we look at, how do we get to a cloud solution with Maven.  It was an extraordinarily hard thing to do because we didn't have one.  We had to rely on USDI's [Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence] intel authorities to take advantage of the cobbled-together solution using one of the existing cloud solutions, just for proof of concept. "
"Now, I'm experiencing the same thing, building the Joint Common Foundation in the JAIC.  We've had to go out and take some really convoluted paths to get just the beginnings of some cloud so we can show, as Mr. Deasy saw when he visited us over at our location, to see what that common foundation is capable of doing. "
"Without an enterprise cloud solution, this is -- this is far too complicated.  I can make that a lot easier by the cloud office, the Cloud Program Office, taking care of most of the administration pieces of this.  And we just go out and provision the cloud. "
Q:  Thank you.  That's clear. 
"MR. DEASY:  And let's not lose the fact that when people think of cloud, they think of this storage environment, they think of this compute capability where all this data is stored.  I would say it's what you put on the top of a cloud that really matters.  "
"And the fact that we're going to be able to build applications in a more consistent way because we're going to now have a methodology and a road map by having an enterprise cloud to build differently.  The fact that you're going to build applications differently, which means that you can secure them in a very different way versus the multitude of ways that we build applications today on a disparate number of clouds.  And I don't want that to get lost in this narrative as well. "
"LT. GEN. SHANAHAN:  And if I might, that answers part -- I'm going to answer part of what you were asking earlier, too.  I think this is a point that I didn't raise earlier.  If a unit is deploying somewhere, you know, let's just say into theater; it doesn't have to be on-ship, but let's just say Army, Marine unit, and they're taking a portable device, a compute device.  Each one of those today is built on a different operating system at a baseline.  So if you want to put some apps on top of that before you deploy, it takes an awfully long time.  "
"In the proposed hub-and-spoke model, those portable devices will have a commonality to them, but very easy to build apps on top of them and just deploy them as quickly as you need to, to get down-range.  "
"As Mr. Deasy was alluding to, as we build out a platform for the Joint Common Foundation, our whole intent -- I used the word or the phrase earlier -- is democratizing access to data.  There is no reason in the future why a Marine or a soldier in a forward location in a combat outpost in Afghanistan, can't do his or her own app as long as we've given them that common foundation, built on an enterprise cloud solution. "
"Imagine that scenario, where I need something right now, the data's out there.  Today, they just can't access the data.  It's too hard to do, the data's dirty.  If we can get them to do that, they can actually start doing apps for wartime reasons in a much, much quicker timeline. "
STAFF:  Did any of those dial-ins join us? 
"Q:  Yes, I had a follow-up.  Just on Jackie's -- to follow up on Jackie's question, have you actually briefed anyone senior at the White House?  Yeah, done educated -- I know you said you did Congress and ..."
MR. DEASY:  I continue to brief a number of people across government. 
Q:  And do you have any sense of how long this education process for the secretary...
"MR. DEASY:  I think that was the question Justin had asked earlier.  There is not an end timeline.  And one of the reasons it's difficult to predict, though we have an outline, just think about the way that you learn.  There's a series of follow-on questions.  I'm sure they'll give him -- he'll give us follow-on actions, things he'll want to understand deeper.  We'll come back to him. "
"So I -- all I can say is, it will be an iterative cycle.  We have an outline on the approach, but I can't predict what the end date will be. "
"Q:  I have a follow-up on my earlier question.  You'd spoken before about how having more than one awardee for JEDI would create unnecessary complexities, as you put it.  Does DOD, based on your current cloud workforce, have the people in place to do something like that?  If you were told by Esper tomorrow..."
MR. DEASY:  Yeah. 
"Q:  ... ""We want to go multi-cloud,"" could you do it? "
"MR. DEASY:  So understand, we will have a multitude of clouds.  What we're trying to  describe today is, if you think about everything just said – Gen. Shanahan said, think about the complexity of what it's going to take when we bring in the first cloud provider, to set up the unclassified, the classified, the Top Secret, CONUS [continental United States], OCONUS [outside continental United States], Forward-base, disconnected warfighter.  "
"Just pause for a second, think about the complexity of setting that up.  We've got to learn how to do that with somebody. It doesn't end there.  That doesn't mean we're going to end up with just a single cloud provider.  That's why I have stressed, the two-year break with a three-year extension, with a three-plus-two.  That was done by intentional design, that as we learn how to do this, then we can start to bring in additional cloud providers. "
"To your specific question, we will source the appropriate talent we need for whatever the permutation, whatever is going to be the end state.  So we will make sure we're successful, in sourcing the right talent. "
Q:  Thank you. 
Q:  (Inaudible).  
"So the way that this is structured intentionally, does this give DOD, in a way, a sense of pivoting if the first contract goes out for the million, say two years, and then two years later, someone else -- you could essentially recompete and have another..."
"MR. DEASY:  Yeah.  I mean -- I mean, you know, this is -- this is a standard procurement process.  And then at the end of the two years, we have decisions we could do.  We could obviously extend.  What we will do, I can guarantee you, is we will look at the state of the marketplace. "
"I mean, one of the reasons that I chose the two, three, three, two is if you kind of look at where cloud technology is going, the natural maturity of the cloud marketplace is every two to three years, there is major breakthroughs.  "
"So it's very much by design, that we say we need these break points.  Because there could be new technology from a completely different player, that can help us in the enterprise fight that Gen. Shanahan talked about, that we're going to want to bring in.  "
"And we're going to use those natural break points to do just that.  Scan the marketplace, evaluate new technology offerings.  Based on whoever we have, decide if that's the best course to stay with, or to bring in multiple. "
"You know, all you have to do is look at the evolution of technology.  And I think we can all safely say, the market's going to look very different, next two years, three years after that, three years after that, which is why we constructed it the way we did."
"Q:  Okay.  So in terms of financing that, are you hoping for a more competitive price point, the next time you go back..."
"MR. DEASY:  So what I can't get into is, obviously, the source selection process.  Suffice to say that the way we are constructing this, we are going to get very, very competitive pricing.  And the way we've set this up, with the two plus three plus three, is it will always keep us at the forefront of the most competitive pricing. "
"Q:  Okay.  One of the narratives, or questions that people keep asking me about is this one of centralizing this entire thing with one provider, does that create a central target and thus a vulnerability going forward?  Can you address that idea?"
"MR. DEASY:  Yeah, so first of all, in answering that, there's a huge assumption there that everything we do across the Department of Defense can sit on this one cloud, that's simply not the case.  Think about the fact we already have a multitude of clouds. We already have a very large installed internal base of IT applications and systems."
"One of the things that we spend a lot of time talking through is A, we've got to make it simple for people to get access to and to put new application capability up on to the enterprise cloud, but we have this ongoing tension of we've got to make it simple for people to use but we've got to make sure they're always using it in the most secure manner."
"So there's a number of safeguards we have in our selection process through the RFP, and that we will be doing with the help of U.S. Cyber Command, NSA [National Security Agency] and DISA [Defense Information Systems Agency] that will constantly allow us to stress test our commercial environment to make sure it's secure."
"LT. GEN. SHANAHAN:  And -- and I can tell you from my own -- getting my own education in the two years of -- of directing Project Maven, I got deep into the cybersecurity aspects of it, and then both on physical security to see what these clouds -- I mean their -- their entire business model is based on consumer confidence that their data is going to be protected."
"So physical security is incredible and then virtual security in terms of terms I didn't even know existed two years ago -- sharding and striping and sending data out into -- and encrypting data at rest -- and then the idea of -- of 1,000 attack surfaces versus protecting a much more narrow -- I won't say it's only one attack surfaces -- there are advantages to cybersecurity having a -- a -- a limited cloud -- a number of cloud providers for that reason."
"There's a -- nothing is ever invulnerable, nobody would ever claim that, but there are -- the -- the -- the money, the time, the people they place on -- on security across these enterprise cloud companies today, it's an enormous amount of resources they put against it."
"And I think if Gen. Nakasone was here, he would echo that from his role as the Director of NSA and Commander of Cyber Command.  He knows -- knows a lot more about cybersecurity than I do and I think he would echo ... "
"MR. DEASY:  Yes, on of the conversations Gen. Nakasone and I have all of the time is because of the multitude of clouds, these siloed, independent -- independently configured environments that have been established over a number of years that, where he said this is -- this enterprise cloud actually helps us to become more secure than the  environment you have with a multitude of clouds that are set up in a variety of different ways."
"Q:  Can I ask you -- on the source selection process, I know you -- you can't get too much into it, but this building has had great success in the last few years of (inaudible), becoming protest-proof basically, not losing protests."
Can you give a feel for the size and scope of -- of this source selection team?  Is it a team of like 30 individual operations that will be ...
"MR. DEASY:  Yeah, that would be inappropriate for me to start to describe the team, the makeup of it, other than to say that they come from a variety of parts from the Department of Defense, they all come with the necessary expertise you would expect a team to have to be able to properly evaluate cloud providers."
Q:  You're not part of that team ... 
"MR. DEASY:  No, I am not."
Q:  ... you're -- you're not the source selection authority ... 
"MR. DEASY:  No, I am -- I am not."
Q:  And Gen. Shanahan is not?
"LT. GEN. SHANAHAN:  No, I'm as far removed to that as I could possibly be.  Thank you."
"STAFF:  All right, I think we have time for one more."
"Q:  Well, can I have two really short ones?  The first is on IT, like workforce stuff.  I know you guys have a hard time hiring technical talent sometimes, a big issue for you guys.  When we talk to smart people from the valley and whatnot, that want to come work for the government, one -- their cloud native, they're used to working in those kinds of systems and they say it's a huge barrier."
Does this address that?  Would that address that so you might get a better pipeline of smart people coming in?  
"And then secondly, when it’s operational, will you get a mandate down to the departments to ensure that they begin migrating and or would that cause some of the existing clouds to kind of go away to get under the same architecture?"
"MR. DEASY:  Yeah, so both of those -- the first one, one of the things I'm really excited about and I've seen this throughout my career is when you have a world of just about every type of technology platform -- and the Department of Defense has accumulated over the years just about every technology platform -- think about staffing, hiring, retaining for that variety."
"Now imagine in a world where we now start to have a much more standardized environment with latest, greatest technology that is constantly being updated, that is highly attractive to young people, that's exactly the environment they want to come in with.
They want to come in and work with the latest technology, they want to be able to use those skills.  Those skills obviously we then have to work really hard to retain them, but that's what they want to work on.  And so this is a world that we want to create for a lot of reasons, one of which is just from a workforce standpoint, it's just a lot easier to manage and maintain those individuals."
Your part two question was?
Q:  When it’s operational issue some kind of mandate to ... 
"MR. DEASY:  Oh, there's a government at large mandate and we call it a -- you know, cloud smart strategy across all of government of -- the philosophy that I have -- share with the Department of Defense is, you know, we have two worlds."
"I use these terms, we have a green field and we have a brown field.  The brown field is all of the technology that we've created over a number of years.  Now, you should not hold that we're going to simply lift all of that technology and drop it into a cloud.  It simply does not make sense."
"We are going to have to go through a very thoughtful process of what of our existing applications would make sense to lift and shift over?  We're going to look at such things as natural break points in the technology, where you are going to do upgrades on the infrastructure."
"And so we're going to have a methodology of how you go through and select the appropriate existing applications to re-port to a cloud.  Then there's green field -- green field are the things we haven't created yet today.  These will be the new ideas, the new problems that we'll have to help solve for the warfighter tomorrow."
"All the services right now are moving towards a cloud first mindset that says when you're going to start something new, the bias will be to build it onto a cloud first.  It could be JEDI or it could be a unique environment based on the requirements of the warfighter, but yes, our bias will be in the future to move to a cloud-first mindset."
"STAFF:  All right, thank you gentlemen, is there anything you wanted to leave the group with?"
"MR. DEASY:  No, just thank you for your time and -- and hopefully this helped to dispel some of the narrative out there."
LT. GEN. SHANAHAN:  Thank you.
MR. DEASY:  Thank you.

"
"Thanks, John, for that introduction, and, more importantly – where’d John go? – for your many years of service, many years of friendship to me, and wonderful service to our country over so many years, and leadership of this great institution."
"I also want to thank CSIS for hosting this important conference, and I want to commend my Deputy Secretary of Defense – Bob – and General Paul Selva – guys, thanks for holding the fort down last week – for their leadership and hard work in leading the technology investment thrusts we call the Third Offset Strategy.  I’ll speak about that, but of course, in this speech I also want to speak about about innovation in all its dimensions – of which technological innovation is a piece, a very important piece.  Because being more innovative in every way we can is critical to the future success of our military and our Defense Department."
"Today, we have the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  There’s no other military that’s stronger, more capable, more experienced, or frankly, more innovative.  That’s why our military edge is second-to-none.  And it’s a fact every American ought to be proud of.  "
"But it’s also a fact that our military’s excellence isn’t a birthright.  It’s not guaranteed.  And we can’t take it for granted in the 21st century – we have to earn it again and again.  And that’s what this is all about:  innovating to stay the best.  And I want to talk to you today about how we’re doing that in some different areas – our technology, our operations, our organization, and above all, our people."
"And right now it’s imperative we do so, because we live in a relentlessly changing, and fiercely competitive world.  There’s the faster pace of change, which sets up a fierce competition between the present and the future; competition with other nations, not only with us, but also with each other; and competition with terrorists and other malefactors for whom we are the game to beat – if they can – even if only in one place and at one time."
"Technology is one example of such change and competition that many of us have long been familiar with.  When I began my own career in physics decades ago, most technology of consequence originated in America, and much of that was sponsored by government, especially the Department of Defense.  Today, we’re still major sponsors, but much more technology is commercial.  The technology base is global.  And other countries have been trying to catch up with the breakthroughs that for the last several decades made our military more advanced than any other.  And much of the frontier of innovation is commercial, leading to additional sources of competitive dynamism outside our five walls."
"Against this background, your Defense Department is confronting a world security environment that’s also dramatically different than the last generation, and even the generation before that.  Indeed, the U.S. military is at this moment addressing five major, unique, and rapidly evolving challenges.  We’re countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe.  We’re managing historic change in the Asia-Pacific – the single most consequential region for America’s future.  We’re strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s continued nuclear and missile provocations.  We’re checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Gulf, and protecting our friends and allies in the Middle East.  We’re accelerating the certain and lasting defeat of ISIL – destroying it in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, and everywhere else it metastasizes around the world, even as we help protect our homeland and our people.  And at the same time as all of this, we’re preparing to contend with an uncertain future – ensuring that we continue to be ready for challenges we may not anticipate today."
"We don’t have the luxury of choosing between these challenges – we have to do them all.  And as the world changes and complexity increases, we’ll have to change, too – how to invest, how we fight, how we operate as an organization, and how we attract and nourish talent."
"As we do, we have to be able to move fast, because the advantages we expect to derive from each innovative cycle today will not last as long as they used to.  All the commercial and global change that’s occurred across the technology landscape has made repeated and rapid cycles necessary, and made high-end tech a lot more accessible to competitors.  "
"Think about it.  While the Cold War arms race was characterized by the inexorable but steady accumulation of strength – with the leader simply having more, bigger, or better weapons – today’s era of military competition is characterized by the additional variables of speed and agility, such that leading the race now frequently depends on who can out-innovate faster than everyone else, and even change the game.  In the area of investment, it’s no longer just a matter of what we buy.  Now more than ever, what also matters is how we buy things, how quickly we buy things, whom we buy them from, and how rapidly and creatively we can adapt them and use them in different and innovative ways – all this to stay ahead of future threats and future enemies technologically."
"That’s why I’ve been so intent as Secretary of Defense not only to plant the seeds for a number of different technologies that we think will be determinative in giving us a warfighting advantage for the future – more on those in a moment – but also to be more innovative and agile in all aspects of DoD:  in our operations, in our organization, and in the talent management of our all-volunteer forces. "
"In each of these four areas, I – along with the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Service Chiefs, all our excellent Combatant Commanders, and the Defense Department’s civilian leadership – have had a lot of help.  We’ve had help from Washington think tanks like CSIS, from our defense labs and industry partners, and also from many innovative Americans who understand the innovation imperative and who aren’t in our community now, but understand the need for our mission of national security and want to help.  And all of us have been pushing the Pentagon to think outside our five-sided box and invest aggressively in innovation."
"And I want to focus on that in the rest of my remarks – the clear strategic imperative we have to innovate in each area, how we’ve been innovating so far, and how we need to innovate going forward."
"Given the topic of this particular conference, I’ll start with technology."
"The strategic imperative to innovate technologically is well-known to those who’ve been paying attention, and that’s many of you here at CSIS.  Nations like Russia and China are trying to close the technology gap with the United States, and as I noted, high-end military technology has diffused – sometimes becoming available to countries like North Korea and Iran, as well as non-state actors.  And at the same time, our own reliance on technological systems like satellites and the Internet has grown, creating vulnerabilities that our adversaries are eager to exploit."
"To stay ahead of these threats, and to stay the best, we’re pushing the envelope with research and development in new technologies like data science, biotech, cyber defense, electronic warfare, robotics, undersea warfare, autonomy, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and much, much more.  And I’ll repeat yet again, since it keeps coming up, that when it comes to using autonomy in our weapons systems, we will always have a human being in decision-making about the use of force."
"Now we’re making some serious investments here.  Just to remind you, the latest budget I’ve proposed – a budget I strongly encourage Congress to pass when they return to Washington next month – will invest $72 billion in research and development in the next year alone.  That’s more than double what Apple, Intel, and Google spent last year on R&D combined."
"This budget marked a strategic turning point for the Department of Defense, with our Third Offset Strategy driving a wide range of new, innovative technological investments in order to advance and sharpen our military edge.  We’re making these investments because we aren’t yet exactly certain what, or where, this offset is going to come from – it could be one area of technology, or several.  Remember, previous offset strategies were generational successes, reflections of the security environment of their eras, and were only recognized as such after the fact.  Today, speed and agility are key, and because of the world we live in, the next offset will not look like previous ones.  And it may not even end up being what we might consider a traditional ‘offset’ strategy at all.  That’s why we’re seeding these investments in lots of different technologies – so we can see which ones germinate, how they develop, what they produce, and how we can use them most effectively. "
"And in addition to these critical investments, it’s important to note how DoD is innovating technologically – how we’re innovating technologically – by creating technologies from within, by bringing in technology from without, and by repurposing technologies and capabilities we already have.  Because different entities are focused on each. "
"Within the Defense Department, we have dozens of DoD labs and engineering centers across the country – each one home to great technological innovators, both civilian and military, who work closely with a very innovative defense industry that’s long supported us and kept us on the cutting edge.  And they’re continuing to do so today, across a wide range of critical technologies.  For example, our Navy labs are developing and prototyping undersea drones in multiple sizes and with diverse payloads – which is important, since among other reasons unmanned undersea vehicles can operate in shallow waters where manned submarines cannot.  Also, our Army labs are working on gun-based missile defenses, which can help defeat incoming missile raids at much lower cost per round than more expensive interceptors – imposing higher costs on the attacker.  And our Air Force labs are pioneering applications for neuromorphic computing – that is, hardware, software, and systems inspired by the working mechanisms of the human brain – which offers the prospect of overcoming the limitations of current computing architectures, and enabling information superiority in air, space, and cyberspace."
"As I said, America’s innovative defense industry is a key partner in this – because, remember, we don’t build anything in the Pentagon.  That’s not the American way.  The Soviet Union tried that, and it didn’t work out very well for them.  "
"Today, with more technological innovation happening in the commercial sector, we need to be able to identify and do business with companies outside our traditional defense orbit as well as those within, and welcome them into our defense technology community.  That’s why last year I created our Defense Innovation Unit-Experimental, or DIUx – to help build bridges with startups and other commercial technology firms located in innovation ecosystems across the United States, and help us more quickly adopt technologies that can help our troops accomplish their missions.  DIUx opened its doors last August with a West Coast office in Silicon Valley, and since then, we iterated and launched DIUx 2.0 in May, and opened a DIUx East Coast office in Boston, and established an outpost in Austin, Texas.  One important area where DIUx recently solicited proposals is in micro-satellites and advanced analytics – leveraging the revolution in commercial space and machine learning to transform how we use space-based tools and advanced data processing to provide critical situational awareness to forces around the world.  And it also adds resilience, by the way, to our national space architecture."
"Meanwhile, under the guidance of the Strategic Capabilities Office, or SCO, we’re also changing and adapting how we use existing platforms and technologies already in our inventory – giving them new roles and game-changing capabilities to confound potential opponents.  As some of you know, I created SCO in 2012 when I was Deputy Secretary of Defense – putting Will Roper, by the way, in charge of it, Will – and earlier this year, I lifted the veil on several of its projects that we’re investing in, such as the arsenal plane, a new anti-ship capability for the SM-6 missile, and swarming drones on the sea and in the air.  In fact, this technology took a large step forward just this week.  You’ll be hearing more about that in the months to come"
"A prominent theme of SCO’s work is spearheading creative and unexpected new ways to use our existing missiles and advanced munitions across varied domains.  One example of this I want to highlight – it’s something that we haven’t talked about publically before today – is SCO’s project to develop a cross-domain capability for the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS.  By integrating an existing seeker onto the front of the missile, they’re enabling it to hit moving targets, both at sea as well as on land.  With this capability, what was previously an Army surface-to-surface missile system can project power from coastal locations up to 300 kilometers into the maritime domain.*"
"Going forward, as these and other investments yield new weapons systems and warfighting capabilities in the coming years – some of them much sooner than you might think – they’ll need to be demonstrated so that they’re effective in deterring future conflict.  And it will be important to ensure they are allowed to run their course.  We have to protect the most promising, and integrate those concepts and ideas into our programs, rather than let them be uprooted just because they’re new – which is always a tendency in tight budgets."
"Of course, how we use technology is just as important as the technology itself, if not more, which is why we’re also investing aggressively in operational innovation.  Our plans and operations must account not only for the evolving challenges we face from our competitors, but also the opportunities afforded by new capabilities as they come on line – so technological and operational innovation must go hand-in-glove."
"Here, the strategic imperative is rooted in the fact that while we’ve spent the last 15 years innovating expertly – and I’m very proud of it – in how we kill terrorists and counter insurgencies, we did so to some extent at the expense of our expertise in full-spectrum warfighting.  Other nations have gotten good at that over the years, and in some cases they’ve been devising new methods to try to counter our advantages and pre-empt us from being able to respond – not just by developing high-tech weapons, but also by crafting operational approaches such as hybrid warfare techniques."
"For these reasons, we’ve been reinvigorating our training across the services to return to full-spectrum readiness, and we’ve been re-thinking how we operate to find new advantages against potential adversaries – including by changing and adapting how we might fight with friends and allies.  For example, in Europe, we’ve been working with our NATO allies to adapt and write a new playbook for our Strong and Balanced strategic approach to Russia – one that takes the lessons of history and leverages our alliance’s strengths in new, networked ways to counter new challenges like cyber and hybrid warfare; to integrate conventional and nuclear deterrence; and to adjust our posture and presence so we can be more agile and responsive.  And in the Asia-Pacific, we’ve been modernizing our alliances, strengthening new partnerships, and helping to build a Principled and Inclusive regional Security Network."
"This rubber meets the road in how we’re revising our actual plans for potential operations themselves.  Now, we’re always updating our plans and developing new operational concepts to account for any changes in potential adversary threats and capabilities, but we’ve also updated our core contingency plans to make sure they apply innovation to our operational approaches – including ways to overcome emerging threats, such as cyberattacks, anti-satellite weapons, and anti-access, area denial systems.  And at the same time that we innovate in our plans to counter these conventional threats, we’re also ensuring that – with respect to potential confrontations with nuclear powers – we continue to sustain America’s nuclear deterrent as we recapitalize our nuclear triad and infrastructure.  "
"Overall, we’re building in modularity that gives our chain of command’s most senior decision-makers a greater variety of choices.  We’re making sure planners take into account how to prevail if they have to execute their plan at the same time another contingency is taking place, so they don’t fall into a trap of presuming the one they’re planning for would be the only thing we’d be doing in the world at that time.  We’re injecting agility and flexibility into our processes, because the world, its challenges, and our potential opponents are not monolithic, and we have to be just as dynamic to stay ahead of them.  And we’re prioritizing transregional and transfunctional integration in our plans – which is an imperative considering that conflict doesn’t segment anymore, and the challenges we face today are less likely than ever before to confine themselves to neat regional or functional boundaries.  This was one of the Goldwater-Nichols reforms I proposed here at CSIS nearly seven months ago, and it will be coordinated on my behalf by our Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Joe Dunford – whom, by the way, we’re very fortunate to have in his job.  Recommending him to President Obama was one of the best decisions I’ve made as Secretary of Defense."
"The result of this is that we’ve revised all of our war plans to ensure we have the agility and ability to win the fights we’re in, the wars that could happen today, and the wars that could happen in the future.  And while I can’t say more – and if any audience can appreciate why, a CSIS audience can – I’ll tell you that I’m very proud of this evolving family of plans."
"Now, innovation in technology and in operations are necessary for us, but they’re not sufficient – because at the pace today’s world demands, we can only succeed in these by being an agile organization that nurtures innovation in all its forms.  So we’re also investing in innovative organizational structures and practices. "
"The strategic imperative here is that DoD must be an organization that better fosters innovative thinking and ideas that can help us to stay ahead of our competitors.  The Defense Department is one of the largest organizations in the world, and as many of you know well, we can be pretty bureaucratic and slow-moving, where it’s easy to default to the status quo of continuing to do things the same way we’ve always done them.  But we can’t afford that in today’s security environment – we need to be a place where thinking differently is welcomed and fostered, not where good ideas go to die just because they happen to be new."
"Over the last few years, I’ve created a number of entities to help signify and drive innovation throughout DoD – including SCO, DIUx, and the Defense Digital Service.  And I most recently created the Defense Innovation Board, to advise me and future leadership on how we can keep growing more competitive.  "
"As you know, the Defense Innovation Board is one of several advisory boards that report to me, each with a distinctive mission and membership chosen for a distinctive kind of expertise.  The Defense Science Board, of which I was long a member, is comprised of scientists and technologists with deep expertise in weapons systems and defense R&D.  The Defense Policy Board, on which I also served – and which, by the way, we’re grateful that John Hamre chairs – has a membership with exceptional foreign and defense policymaking experience.  The Defense Business Board, to name another, has members who understand DoD’s vast business enterprise and practices.  The Defense Innovation Board has a different membership and a different role – its members were chosen for their record of innovation outside of the Defense Department, and for their ability to suggest innovative approaches that have worked in their leadership experience, and that might be applicable to us.  "
"The Innovation Board is chaired by Google Alphabet’s Eric Schmidt, and its membership represents a cross-section of America’s most innovative industries, organizations, and people – people like Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, LinkedIn’s Reid Hoffman, Code for America’s Jennifer Pahlka, astrophysicist Neil Degrasse Tyson, Mike McQuade from United Technologies, and retired Admiral Bill McRaven, now chancellor of the University of Texas.  And I’ve charged them and the rest of the board to help keep DoD imbued with a culture of innovation – to support innovators themselves, the people in our defense enterprise who are willing to try new things, fail fast, and iterate – and to make sure we’re always doing everything we can to stay ahead of our competitors."
"At the outset, I gave them the very specific task of identifying innovative private-sector practices that might be of use to us in DoD, along the lines of our Hack the Pentagon pilot program, which invited hackers to help us find vulnerabilities in our networks and report them to us, similar to the bug bounties that several of America’s major companies already routinely conduct.  While this approach to crowdsourcing cybersecurity is fairly widespread in the private sector, our use of it in the Pentagon was the first time in the entire federal government.  And it was so successful, we’re now expanding it to other parts of DoD.  This is the perfect example of the kind of recommendations I’m looking for from the Innovation Board – things that are out there and that might be useful to us."
"Now, of course, not everything in the private sector will make sense for us, because we’re always mindful that the military isn’t a company – it’s dedicated to the profession of arms.  And so for important reasons, we’re not always going to be able to do everything the same way others do.  But that doesn’t mean we can’t look ourselves in the mirror and look around the country for new ideas and lessons we can learn, and ways we can operate more effectively.  "
The Defense Innovation Board held its first public meeting earlier this month and made some preliminary recommendations to me and the public about some innovative practices that might make sense for us to adopt.  And today I want to tell you about several that I’ve decided we’re going to do.
"First, we’re going to increase our focus on recruiting talented computer scientists and software engineers into our force, both military and civilian.  We’ll do this through targeted recruiting initiatives ranging from our Reserve Officer Training Corps to our civilian scholarship-for-service program that’s intended to help build the next generation of DoD science and technology leaders – all with the goal of making computer science a core competency of the department."
"Second, we’re going to invest more broadly in machine learning, through targeted challenges and prize competitions, and not through a new brick-and-mortar institution, but rather through a ‘virtual center of excellence’ model that establishes stretch goals and incentivizes academic and private-sector researchers to achieve them.  Since this is an area where both the academy and commercial technology companies have been making significant strides, I’ve asked DIUx to pilot this approach by sponsoring an initial prize challenge focused on computer vision and machine learning."
"And third, we’re going to create a DoD Chief Innovation Officer, who will act as a senior advisor to the Secretary of Defense and will serve as a spearhead for innovation activities, including but not limited to those suggested by the Defense Innovation Board – such as building software platforms and human networks to enable workforce-driven innovation across DoD at scale, sponsoring innovation contests and tournaments, and providing training and education that promotes new ideas and approaches to collaboration, creativity, and critical thinking.  "
"Many different organizations have recently embraced this position, and also started to regularly run these kind of innovation tournaments and competitions – including tech companies like IBM, Intel, and Google – and it’s time we did as well, to help incentivize our people to come up with innovative ideas and approaches, and be recognized for them."
"Going forward, I’m confident that the logic behind everything I’m talking about today will be self-evident to future defense leadership, as will the value of these efforts – but they also need to have the momentum and institutional foundation to keep going under their own steam and to continue to thrive.  We must ensure that we keep leading the way, and keep disrupting, challenging, and inspiring all of us to change for the better."
"And this brings me, finally, to how we’re innovating in terms of our people, and in the talent management of our all-volunteer force.  While it’s the last area of innovation I’m going to discuss today, it’s also the most important – because the fact is, our people are the source of every innovative thing we’ve ever done, are doing, or will do.  "
"Indeed, much more than our technology, operations, and organization, our people are the key to us having the finest fighting force – in our uniformed military, in our DoD civilian workforce, and in the defense industry that supports us.  And that means we need to compete for good people as far into the future as we can. "
"Now the good news is, there’s lots of opportunity here, as well as new techniques and technologies in talent management – such as the kind of advanced data analytics that underpin companies like LinkedIn.  But there are also challenges we face – in terms of the limitations of our current technology in the human resources area, and as generations and labor markets change.  Even so – so even as our force of today is outstanding – we must ensure that we continue to attract and retain the most talented young men and women that America has to offer in future generations of defense.  And that’s why we’ve been taking step after step to build what I call the Force of the Future.  "
"I’ve announced four different ‘links’ so far to the Force of the Future.  The first focused on building and increasing on-ramps and off-ramps for technical talent to flow in both directions – creating the Defense Digital Service, expanding the Secretary of Defense Corporate Fellows Program, and more.  This will let more of America’s brightest minds contribute to our mission of national defense, even if only for a time or a project.  And it will also allow more of DoD and the defense industry’s innovative military and civilian technologists – of which there are many – to engage in new ways with our country’s larger innovative ecosystem, especially the parts that may have no experience with, or even have hesitations about, working with defense. "
"Next, the Force of the Future’s second link focused on increasing retention among our ranks through increased support to our military families.  It’s often said that when you recruit a servicemember, you retain a family; after all, it’s no secret that military life is difficult, and can be especially tough on our military families.  And let me remind you that our force is largely a married one, with about 70 percent of officers and 50 percent of enlisted who are married.  Now, we can’t change the fundamentals of military service, but we can make some changes to make life easier for our married people – and increase the possibility that they’ll want to stay at that critical moment when they’re trying to reconcile military life and family life.  That’s why we expanded maternity and paternity leave, why we extended childcare hours on bases, and why we’re giving more families the possibility of some geographic flexibility in return for additional service commitments."
"After that, the third link to the Force of the Future focused on how we can make some common-sense improvements to military talent management – particularly for our officer corps.  In some cases, our current system proves too rigid.  It can limit the ability of our services to achieve the right force mix they need, especially at a time when we’re seeking to promote a wider range of experience, perspective, and training to strengthen the overall effectiveness of the force.  That’s why we want to give the military services the authority to do things like expand lateral entry for more specialties and adjust lineal numbers based on superior performance."
"And most recently, link number four to the Force of the Future made clear that this is not only about our military, but also about our civilian workforce.  When people talk about DoD civilians, they’re talking about over 700,000 talented Americans serving across the country and around the world.  More than 85 percent of them live outside of the DoD – D.C., excuse me – the D.C. area.  They fix aircraft, they operate shipyards and ranges, and more.  They do critical jobs, and without them DoD wouldn’t function.  So the goal here is the same as with our military personnel:  to make sure our future civilian workforce is just as great as the one we have today, in several ways – by directly hiring civilian employees from college campuses, by creating a new two-way civilian talent exchange program with the private sector, by expanding our scholarship-for-service program in mission-critical science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields, and more."
"Also, in addition to each of these links, over the last year we opened up all combat positions to women, and lifted DoD’s ban on transgender servicemembers, so that we can now draw on 100 percent of America’s population for our all-volunteer force – focusing purely on a person’s willingness and ability to serve our country and contribute to our mission, and giving everyone the full and equal opportunity to do so."
"Going forward, there will still be much more work to do – and you’ll soon be hearing from me more about the Force of the Future.  But these links span the spectrum of our opportunities, our challenges, and the lifetime of a member of our all-volunteer force – recruitment, retention, development, transition – and also our valuable civilian workforce.  And for the first time in a long time, DoD’s Personnel and Readiness office has a real, proactive agenda – a concrete action plan to guide its efforts, so that they’re doing more than just being reactive belatedly to issues that crop up.  And based on support for these efforts that I’m seeing in the military services and across our department, I’m confident that the implementation of all these initiatives will continue moving forward, and ensure that the Force of the Future is as great as the force of today."
"I’ve described today a lot of ways the Department of Defense is changing and will continue to change in the future, but I want to close by reminding all of you, all of DoD, and all of America that as we sit here this morning, our country’s strengths are undeniable.  "
"We have the best military, of course – spanning our people, our investments, our dedication to the mission, and the public support we receive from the American people – but there’s much more than that.  Our economy is growing.  We have world-class schools and universities.  We uphold the right values, which is one reason why we have an unrivaled network of friends and allies.  Meanwhile the operational experience of our force – hard-earned – is second-to-none.  And we have the greatest innovative culture on the planet.  When we’ve brought that innovative culture to bear in service of others – that is, to defend our country and help make a better world for our children – it’s long been America’s open military secret.  And we remain dedicated to doing so, and it can be so.  "
"We have a legacy of innovating, but that in itself is not enough.  That’s why we’re moving aggressively toward a more innovative future, and why everything I’ve talked about today is intended to ensure exactly that.  Going forward, our success will depend on whether we can keep it up."
"Like its predecessors, the next wave of innovation and advantage will be a generational success – and it’s only just beginning.  We probably don’t even know yet the names of the people who will make it a reality.  More likely than not, it won’t be by me or anyone from my generation.  Instead, it’ll be the generation that comes after."
"It’ll be junior officers and DoD civilians fresh out of graduate school – some of them here today, perhaps – who decide to spend a year outside of the department at Google or somewhere else, and work with an expert in data science or machine learning.  "
"It’ll be the software engineers and bioscientists who get to know our mission by working with one of our DIUx outposts, and then choose to do a tour of duty in the Defense Digital Service or working at one of our DoD labs."
"It’ll be the enlisted soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines who come up with new operational concepts for overcoming potential adversaries using advanced technologies that may not even exist yet, or defeating a terrorist group we haven’t heard of."
"They’re the ones – they’re the ones – who will end up reinventing and changing anew how we will deter, fight, and win wars in the future.  Our job is to give them the foundation, the right kind of Pentagon to help them succeed:  one that’s more agile and innovative than ever before.  As long as we do, they will ensure – like those who came before them – that our military remains the finest fighting force the world has ever known."
"[*Please note, due to an unfortunate error, the following paragraphs were omitted from this speech.]"
"DIUx and SCO share the characteristics of speed and agility, which has long been a focus of mine.  When I served as Undersecretary for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics at the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, it was imperative that we quickly get our troops in harm’s way the tools they needed to accomplish their mission.  We started the Warfighter Senior Integration Group, which is designed to bring together and bring to bear the full weight of the Defense Department’s senior leadership on addressing our most critical operational needs.  And we established a “fast lane” to rapidly field cutting-edge, much-needed capabilities, like mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles and inexpensive aerostat balloons equipped with cameras to help monitor the security of our forward operating bases. "
"Ultimately this evolved into what we in the Pentagon today call Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUONs) – or the things we need right away for fighting the wars we’re in now – and Joint Emergent Operational Needs (JEONs) – the things we need as soon as possible for a conflict that could start tomorrow.  As I’ve said before, the system is far from perfect, but it has injected some badly needed agility into the Pentagon’s notoriously slow bureaucracy – agility that I’ve been determined to enhance as Secretary of Defense.  And DIUx and SCO build on this legacy with their focus on quickly meeting the near-term needs of not only today’s, but also tomorrow’s warfighter."
"STAFF:  Hey, ladies and gentlemen.  Welcome.  I'm Lieutenant Colonel Dave Eastburn.  I'm the spokesman for Asia-Pacific Security Affairs here at the Pentagon, Defense Press Operations."
I'm going to go over some ground rules really quick.
"First and foremost, this is on-camera, on the record.  So I need to remind everybody to remove their badges, please."
"Having said that, this engagement is about the 2019 DOD report to Congress on the People's Republic of China.  I ask you focus your questions on that.  You'll -- once you're called on, you'll be given one question with a possible follow-up.  ASD Schriver will be making the decision on who to call.  Once he calls on you, please state your name and your outlet clearly."
"And this is a 40-minute session.  And ASD has a tight schedule this afternoon, so just know that we're going to be sticking to that."
"Do you have any questions of me before I go get ASD Schriver?  Okay.  Really quick.  It's Assistant Secretary of Defense Randall G. Schriver.  And I'll spell that for you.  It's R-A-N-D-A-L-L.  G as in Golf.  Schriver, S-C-H-R-I-V-E-R.  And he's the assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs."
Okay?  So no questions?  Be right back.
"STAFF:  So, good morning."
I want to thank you all for being here today for the department's brief on the 2019 report on Military and Security Developments involving the People's Republic of China.  This annual report is the authoritative statement from the United States government on military and security developments involving China.
"As the National Defense Strategy lays out, the strategic competition with China will be the primary concern for the U.S. national security for years to come.  Assistant Secretary for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs Randall Schriver is here to discuss China's security and military strategy with you.  And he will provide some opening remarks.  And I think Lieutenant Colonel Eastburn will help facilitate the engagement this morning."
"So with that, secretary?"
ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE RANDALL G. SCHRIVER:  Thank you.  Good morning.
"As was noted, yesterday, the Department of Defense submitted our annual report to Congress, which we refer to as the China Military Power Report.  And this report is our authoritative statement on how we view developments in the Chinese military, as well as how that integrates with our overall strategy."
"And, of course, this relates directly to what we do here at the Department of Defense in our implementation of our National Defense Strategy, which states that the United States will compete from a position of strength, while encouraging China to cooperate with the United States on security issues where our interests align."
So a few things to comment about the report.
"First of all, with respect to some of the military developments, we continue to see that China seeks to erode U.S. military advantages.  And seeks to gain and maintain influence.  And it backs these ambitions with significant resourcing, which translates into real capabilities and capacity."
"Our 2019 report finds that in the coming decades, China seeks to become both prosperous and powerful, and the report notes that China has a stated goal of becoming a world-class military by 2049."
Some of the specific areas of modernization:  China continues to grow its inventory of DF-26 intermediate-range ballistic missiles.  These missiles are capable of conducting conventional and nuclear precision strikes against targets -- both ground and naval targets in the Western Pacific and Indian Oceans.
"China has begun construction of its second domestically built aircraft carrier in 2018.  Their first domestically built aircraft carrier will likely join the fleet this calendar year.  And, of course, these carriers follow a foreign-acquired carrier."
"In 2017 and '18, China launched its first four Renhai-class guided missile cruisers.  This -- as well as having several more under construction.  We expect that the Renhai will enter operational service this calendar year.  This cruiser class will be China's premier carrier escort for blue-water operations, carrying an array of long-range, anti-ship cruise missiles."
"We also noted, at the Zhuhai Airshow this year in November, the PLA air force conducted a demonstration of its J-20 fighter, its fifth-generation, most modern fighter."
"Equally important to the equipment, China, in 2018, published a new outline for training and evaluation.  And this publication emphasizes realistic and joint training across all warfare domains and tasks the PLA to prepare for conflict aimed at, quote, ""strong military opponents."""
"There also continues to be continued emphasis on civil military integration.  Under the Civil Military Integration Initiative, China's leaders are incentivizing the civilian sector of the economy to enter the defense market to achieve greater efficiencies, innovation and growth."
"Our report also talks about China's continuing use of cyber theft, its targeted investment, its exploitation of private Chinese nationals' access to foreign military technology, all to support its modernization goals.  In 2018, we saw specific efforts targeting such areas as aviation technologies and anti-submarine warfare technologies."
"We also see China continue to pursue global access and -- and increase its global military footprint.  They -- alongside military modernization, they seek to have the ability to affect security along China's periphery and beyond."
"We believe China will seek to establish additional military bases overseas, as well as points for access.  Press reporting in 2018 indicated China sought to expand its military basing and access in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific."
"Regarding some strategic developments -- and it's important to note that all these developments occur in a larger context.  China's leaders are leveraging their growing diplomatic, economic, as well as their military clout to secure China's status as a great power, and with the aim of becoming the preeminent power in the Indo-Pacific."
"In 2018, China continued to implement long-range, state-directed planning, such as Made In China 2025, that challenges the economies of high-tech exporting nations to support China's development, including, indirectly, its military development.  They're also leveraging the One Belt One Road initiative to enhance its global role and to shape other countries' interests so that they align with China."
"After noticing the Made in 2025 and One Belt, One Road have caused some concern, China's leaders have softened their rhetoric and have sought to re-brand to some extent.  However, the fundamental goals of these programs have not changed."
"As our report described, China conducts influence operations -- we have a special section of the report that addresses that -- targeting media, culture, business, academia and the policy communities in the United States and other countries."
"It's also important to note, as our report does, that last year the Chinese Communist Party's Central Military Commission took sole authority of the People's Armed Police.  The People's Armed Police, of course, is the primary force for internal security.  And, of course, our concerns are significant when it comes to the ongoing repression in China.  The Communist Party is using the security forces for mass imprisonment of Chinese Muslims in concentration camps."
"With respect to China's approach to some regional disputes, we're concerned that China's leaders continue to take actions that erode the rules-based order and that they are willing to accept friction in pursuit of those interests."
The report finds that China continues to employ tactics designed to fall short of armed conflict and accomplish its -- its objectives and its goals along its periphery in a so-called gray-zone approach.
"In 2018 China continued its militarization in the South China Sea and, as been widely reported, placed anti-ship cruise missiles, long-range surface-to-air missiles and jamming systems on some of the outposts in the Spratly Islands."
This violated a 2015 pledge made by General Secretary Xi Jinping in the Rose Garden of the White House when he stated that China does not intend to pursue militarization of the Spratly Islands.
"China also continues to use coercive economic measures, both economic tools as well as military tools, to advance its interests and to mitigate opposition for -- from other countries."
"For example, in 2018 China used economic coercion by reducing overseas trade and tourism in an effort to influence domestic politics and political institutions in countries in Oceania, including Australia and Palau."
"With respect to Taiwan, China's overall strategy continues to incorporate elements of both persuasion and coercion and overall is destabilizing not only to Taiwan but to the entire region."
"Bowing to Chinese pressure in 2018, the Dominican Republic, Burkina Faso and El Salvador switched diplomatic relations from Taipei to Beijing.  The Chinese Communist Party seeks to diplomatically isolate Taiwan by stripping away its diplomatic allies."
"It also applies economic pressure by cutting tourism and redirecting investment, and it seeks to undermine democracy in Taiwan by meddling in its elections."
"And while China publicly advocates for peaceful unification, China has never renounced the use of military force, and continues to apply pressure through its posture, increasingly provocative exercises and operations."
"Our report also talks about U.S.-China military-to-military relations.  While the National Defense Strategy emphasizes competition, we certainly don't seek conflict with China and it doesn't preclude cooperation where our interests align."
"We continue to pursue a constructive result-oriented relationship between our countries.  And it's an important part of our regional strategy to have stable, constructive relations with China and a relationship which mitigates the risk of incident or accident."
"So this all sets a framework in which we're operating.  And as I said up front, our National Defense Strategy is aimed at dealing with these challenges."
"You're familiar with the pillars of our strategy:  seeking to increase the lethality of the joint force, strengthening partners and allies, and reforming the business practices of the Department of Defense.  Much of that will put us on a better posture to compete effectively and deal with these challenges."
"So with that, I look forward to your questions."
"Q:  Hi, Lolita Baldor with AP."
"I just wanted to get your -- sort of, a more detailed assessment on China's cyber activities."
"The U.S. has, for a number of years now, talked to them, spoken, taken steps to try and mitigate some of this.  Is it getting worse?  Are any of the actions the U.S. is taking having any impact at all?  And if not, what can the U.S. do about this, to stop the effects on technology stealing?"
MR. SCHRIVER:  I would say the -- the threat and the challenge is persistent.  The Chinese remain very aggressive in their use of cyber.
What's changed is our level of awareness and the steps we're taking to reduce our own vulnerabilities and working with partners and allies to do the same.
Q:  Just two quick questions.
One is you mentioned the -- the Chinese were using concentration camps.  Could you explain why you used that -- the terminology?
"And then also, separately, on Taiwan, there's been an increase in the pace of -- of transits of U.S. warships through the Taiwan Strait.  The French recently just completed an operation.  Could you explain what's behind the increasing frequency and the expansion of the types of ships from countries that are participating?"
MR. SCHRIVER:  Yeah.
"On the first point, the detention camps, given what we understand to be the magnitude of the detention, at least a million but likely closer to 3 million citizens out of a population of about 10 million, so a very significant portion of the population, what's happening there, what the goals are of the Chinese government and their own public comments make that a very, I think, appropriate description."
"With respect to Taiwan, the Taiwan Strait is international water.  We transit it as we see fit.  The Chinese transit as well, and we don't object to their transits because it's international water for -- for the use of all seafaring nations.  And so we'll continue to do that as we see necessary and expect that other countries would do the same, as it is international water."
Q:  (Lucas Tomlinson from Fox News.
Can you explain in what area of Chinese -- China's military they've made the most gains?
"MR. SCHRIVER:  They've -- they've had a very aggressive modernization effort that goes back at least two decades.  So, they've made progress in a number of areas.  I would say their power projection through ballistic and cruise missiles is an area they've made tremendous progress and they continue to develop enhanced capabilities in those areas."
"But, really, it wouldn't be limited to that.  And I think in -- particularly in new domains, they've invested a lot in cyber, space, hypersonics, A.I.  So we're seeing a very aggressive modernization effort backed by resourcing.  For almost two decades, they've had near-double-digit growth in their official defense budgets.  Their defense budgets might actually be higher than that."
"So this is a -- a national effort that's resourced very well.  And it's targeted at them being as, the report says, the preeminent power in the Indo-Pacific."
Q:  And former Vice President Joe Biden says that China is not a competitor of the United States.  What is your response?
"MR. SCHRIVER:  I'll stick with the language in our National Security Strategy and our National Defense Strategy, which identifies China as a strategic competitor."
Q:  Can you talk about the PLA's presence in Tajikistan and how it influences Afghanistan?
"MR. SCHRIVER:  The -- I think the Chinese have growing interests in Central Asia in general and they're looking for partners that will train with them, give them access.  They -- I think they have a variety of interests there that may include Afghanistan, but I think they have broader interests in Central Asia."
I know the Russians are also paying attention to that.  And that could be a source of some friction there.
"We -- we certainly don't begrudge our -- our friends and partners in Central Asia for wanting a relationship with China.  But we would suggest that they keep an eye on what China's ambitions actually are and what kind of influence they're trying to exert, given increased access."
Q:  And is the Chinese military strategy to defeat the United States military conventionally?  Or do they believe they would have to use nuclear weapons in order to do that?
"MR. SCHRIVER:  I think as our report outlines, the Chinese strategy is to supplant the United States and become the preeminent power in the Indo-Pacific.  They also have known interests in particular contingencies -- potential contingencies -- East China Sea, Taiwan, South China Sea -- that they prepare for, as well as on their land borders."
"So we think they are directing their efforts at trying to prevail in those known contingencies, and that would likely involve dealing with the United States in some form, given our commitments in the region."
David?
Q:  David Martin with CBS.
"Do you expect China to continue militarizing the islands in the South China Sea?  And what, if anything, can the U.S. do about it?"
"MR. SCHRIVER:  I don't know what steps China will take beyond what they've already done.  I think those steps at militarizing the outposts are designed with a certain aim.  And they seek to operationalize an illegal expansive sovereignty claim; basically everything inside the Nine-Dash Line, or the entire South China Sea."
"So what we'd do about it is, we fly, sail and operate where international law allows, we're increasingly joined by other countries, to make sure that no one country can change international law and international norms, that that water remains international water; in other words, making that investment that the Chinese have made as insignificant as possible, particularly where their core goal is aimed at."
We also do capacity-building in the region so that our partners and allies have their own capability to monitor their territory that abuts against the disputed territories of the South China Sea.
"And I think what -- what we expect China will see as this unfolds, is they've taken steps that are destabilizing.  In response, they're getting more action from the United States -- freedom of navigation, presence operations -- joined by more and more countries in terms of presence, operations and activities in the South China Sea, more and more capable maritime Asian nations to deal with maritime security."
"And if they continue, potentially more cost imposition.  As you know, we disinvited them from RIMPAC because of their activities in the South China Sea, and there could be more cost imposition in the future."
Q:  Has any of that had any effect so far?
"MR. SCHRIVER:  The effect is -- the fundamental nature of the South China Sea hasn't changed.  We -- China has changed some facts on the ground with respect to the land reclamation and the infrastructure on these outposts.  But the effect that the Chinese seek, which is operationalizing this illegal expansive sovereignty claim, has not been achieved."
"Q:  (inaudible), (inaudible)."
"With regards to Taiwan and the increased pressure from the PRC, what can the U.S. do to provide more tangible substantial support to Taiwan?  And in particular, what is the current progress of the sales of the Abrams and F-16Vs to Taiwan?"
"And in general, have the U.S.-China trade talks affected this at all?"
"MR. SCHRIVER:  So, what we can do to support Taiwan is faithful implementation of the Taiwan Relations Act.  So that has a number of things included in it that relate directly to the military threat Taiwan faces.  We do provide Taiwan with weapons of a defensive character for their sufficient self-defense."
"We also maintain the capacity to resist force, should our national command authority ask us to do so.  So we look at our planning, we look at our own posture, our own capability."
"And we do a number of things to assist Taiwan in the defense service area as well.  We don't just sell them weapons that are required for their defense, we support training and we support the professionalization of the military, looking at reserve forces, et cetera."
So we'll continue faithful implementation of the TRA as the best mechanism to deal with the -- with the emerging China threat that they face.
"Yes, sir?"
"Q:  I want to quick, follow up on Taiwan:  the F-16 sale.  What in the report, what trends in the report, either modernization, tactical or intent trends, justify or give --- provide a rationale for the sale of additional new F-16s?  And where does that sale stand in terms of the requirements scrub going on?"
MR. SCHRIVER:  Sure.
"Well, I didn't comment on the -- the question on tanks and the possible sale of additional F-16s because we don't comment on potential sales that are still under consideration."
"But I think the threat environment is -- is evolving.  As I mentioned, the report talks about the possibility of the J-20 fighter coming online in 2019.  That's a fifth-generation fighter.  The efforts to diplomatically, politically, economically isolate Taiwan suggest that they need a boost in their own confidence and need to see the support of the United States and other friends and partners."
"But the threat is clear and evolving.  So the air threat, surface, submarine threat."
"China's own articulation of its goal to become a world-class military by 2049 also speaks to some of their ambitions associated with a capability to affect a Taiwan scenario, should their leaders ask them to do so."
So we -- we monitor that and look at the capabilities that would be appropriate for Taiwan's defense.
Q:  Another question.
"April 9th, the secretary said that China has fielded an anti-satellite missile unit to an operational Chinese unit.  I didn't see that mentioned anywhere in your report.  Can you square the circle?"
We do talk about China's space development and their interests.  I'm not going to talk about a specific milestone.
"We've obviously seen them conduct a test in the past; an anti-satellite test, which resulted in the space debris that we're still all living with."
So I --
"MR. SCHRIVER:  Well, then it's still there."
MR. SCHRIVER:  So I don't want to talk about a specific milestone.  But we do address in the report China's interest in space and their modernization efforts.  And we know they have a demonstrated capability in the past.
"Q:  Yes, thank you.  Dan Lamothe with the Washington Post."
"Economic colonization has been raised as a concern by the Pentagon, broadly, when it comes to China over the last several months.  The airstrips in Greenland come to mind as an example."
"What's the message to potential partners that are perhaps economically in a position where they need financial help?  You know, the United States assisted in that case, but they probably can't in every case."
"MR. SCHRIVER:  Sure, sure."
"Well, I think the track record is becoming more and more clear with China's predatory economics.  So I guess one of the messages is buyer beware.  If you're -- if you have these development needs and -- and China is offering solutions, read the fine print, make sure you understand the terms of the deal, and make sure you understand the track record that has resulted in countries losing, to some degree, sovereign control of their own country because they're indebted to China and find themselves under enormous Chinese pressure and influence."
"I think we can offer alternatives.  We can also offer alternatives alongside our partners and allies.  So in many cases, development assistance can be produced not only from the United States, but U.S.-Japan solutions, U.S.-Japan-Australia solutions, et cetera."
"I don't think we're as concerned with the dollar-for-dollar side-by-side comparison with China, because what we offer are clean, transparent, scandal-free approaches that benefit the people of the recipient countries, not just a few of the corrupt elites."
"So we -- we need to brand that and market that in a way that countries understand that the choice isn't just one potential source of financing versus another, it's a -- it's a qualitatively different approach that benefits their country a lot more."
"Q:  Tony Bertuca, Inside Defense.  Thank you."
There is tension between U.S. firms that the Defense Department wants to bring into defense industrial base and those firms' desire to have access to the Chinese market.  Can you tell us what the department's message is for those companies about doing business in China?  Is it either/or?  What -- what do you have to say to those companies?
"We want a -- a level of awareness for any U.S. company doing business in China, and depending on the sector, where the vulnerabilities might be, and should those companies have an interest in -- in doing business with the United States Department of Defense -- part of the defense industrial base, understand that there may be potential trade-offs.  And -- and starting from a position of awareness gives private companies who make can their own decisions the ability to balance the pros and cons."
"I mean, I think we are very concerned about being vulnerable and closing those gaps.  It's been a focus of this department.  And at some point there might be discrete decision points that companies have to make."
But we start from a position of wanting to have a dialogue and -- and spreading the awareness and making sure that we understand and the companies understand what -- what those trade-offs may be in the future.
Q:  Can you speak a little bit more to the second topic about the Arctic and what that means specifically for the possibility of (suffering ?) from that region for deterrence?
"MR. SCHRIVER:  The -- the report has two special topics, influenced operations and the Arctic, and we've seen a lot of recent activity on the part of the Chinese to suggest growing interest on their part in the Arctic.  They've released their own policy.  They -- they became an observer to the Arctic Council.  They refer to themselves as a near-Arctic state.  They've announced a Polar Silk Road.  They are embarking on the construction of new icebreakers."
"So it's -- it looks like there's a lot of ambition and I think it's probably multifaceted in terms of their objectives:  potential access to resources, shipping routes.  But you mentioned an area that we will watch.  And whether or not that becomes an access point for -- safe harbor for strategic assets, such as ballistic-missile-carrying submarines, it is a possibility in the future and one we'll watch very closely."
"Yes, ma'am?"
Q:   Laura Seligman with Foreign Policy.
Can you tell us what efforts are ongoing to potentially bring China into some kind of new arms control pact to -- you mentioned IRBMs and other type of cruise missiles?  So what efforts are being pursued and what progress has been made?
"MR. SCHRIVER:  Well, our conversation at the Department of Defense has largely been about the destabilizing nature of China's developments and in particularly their deployments."
"If you look at how they're postured with their ballistic and cruise missiles, there's a significant percentage -- Admiral Harris, I think he used to say 90 percent of systems would be non-INF-compliant if they were in fact in the INF."
"So we're focused mostly on the destabilizing nature of that -- of those deployments, how we can adapt and respond to -- to that environment.  We'll work with our interagency colleagues at the State Department and White House if there's an interest in pursuing arms-control discussions with the Chinese."
"Q:  A question on the report, specifically, the report highlights China as the world's fastest-growing arms supplier with $10 billion particularly to the Middle East between 2013 and 2017.  Just -- is DOD specifically concerned about China's growing military sales in the Middle East and how that could impact military-to-military ties, when you look at, as you said, access or potentially crowding out the market for U.S. supplies that are (pretty ?) limited, such as drones, ballistic missiles, others such as that?"
I think our concerns would be multiple concerns.  I think you've mentioned some of them.
"It's potentially a tool for them to develop closer defense military ties, potentially, for future access.  Obviously, in some instances there is a competitive aspect to it."
"We have, of course, a process through which we review foreign military sales, foreign military financing, which is pretty rigorous and -- and incorporates a -- a broad variety of factors, to include the nature of the regime.  China is less disciplined, and so there's a proliferation risk, as well, to regimes that -- that we would regard as not necessarily responsible."
So there's a -- there's a variety of concerns.  I think the report just notes that as -- as a point of fact and something that we'll continue to watch.
Q:  Amanda Macias from CNBC.
"As the trade talks continue, and given the U.S. deficit which is largely financed by the Chinese and their ambition to develop in the South China Sea, which sees $3.4 million -- trillion in trade, I'm just wondering in your calculus, how is the U.S. set to compete with China, given everyone's bank account?"
"So, we do talk about a whole-of-government approach, in our National Security Strategy, to the China challenge.  We're focused, of course, the Defense Department, on aspects of that, and -- and we leave it to our interagency partners to deal with the trade issues and -- and economic issues."
"I think it is a different environment than when we've competed in the past with other countries or had -- adversaries in the past, that we do have close economic ties and -- and are very integrated.  And so we'll -- we'll have to take in -- that into account as we pursue this competition."
"And by the way, when we talk about competition, we don't say ""enemy,"" we don't say ""adversary.""  Our expectation is we can compete and not spiral into a conflict or any kind of military confrontation.  So we have an expectation that we can address the trade imbalances and the unfair trade practices while we're competing in the security sphere."
Q:  Hi.  Kristina Wong with Breitbart News.
"Can you discuss China's footprints right now in the Arctic?  How many icebreakers, patrol boats, research stations that they have right now?"
MR. SCHRIVER:  That's -- now you're -- you're getting into some very specifics I may have to -- may have to return to you on.
"But they are investing in all of those areas, including the large icebreakers.  They have one in the fleet that's operational, and I believe they have two more under construction, but I want to check that fact.  And then the smaller ice-capable patrol craft."
"So as a general matter, it's a -- it's an area of interest of theirs that we've seen them pursue through resourcing and through their activities, including diplomatic activities such as joining the Arctic Council as an observer."
"And again, we think they have multifaceted objectives:  resources, commercial routes, potential strategic interests."
"But the very specific numbers, I can get back to you on."
Q:  How are we adjusting to China increasingly using its coast guard and militia -- maritime militia to interfere with U.S. naval operations?
"MR. SCHRIVER:  We -- we're less interested in the color of the hull than the activity and the actions.  So what we're most interested in is China behaving in a manner that's respectful of international law and norms, and behaving in a manner that is not destabilizing and is more constructive.  So we're less interested -- again, if its coast guard and maritime militia or classic gray-hulled navy, if the design is to infringe upon the sovereignty of another country, to provoke -- to -- in -- in the -- with the objective of creating some sort of tension that results in a favorable outcome for them, any of that is -- is more concerning than the color of the hull."
Q:  Chia Chang with United Daily News Group Taiwan.
"If China invades Taiwan, will U.S. military help to defend Taiwan?"
"MR. SCHRIVER:  Our law says that any threat to Taiwan -- and -- and it's a broad definition of threat, to include economic threats, blockade, et cetera -- would be regarded with grave concern in the United States.  And the president would consult with the Congress on an appropriate response."
"I think our history is clear:  When Taiwan has been threatened, the U.S. has responded in an appropriate manner to help support Taiwan.  So I think in the future, if we were to -- I think it could be well-expected that we would want to see Taiwan be able to preserve its -- its status, free from coercion."
But the specific response would be that product of that consultation as our law directs us to do in that event.
"Q:  You said at the beginning that China's stated goal is to become a world-class military power by 2049.  If the U.S. is the definition of a world-class military power, does that mean China -- despite all this erosion in the U.S. military advantage, China is still decades behind?"
"MR. SCHRIVER:  I think as our report points out, there are -- they've had substantial progress in niche areas.  So I think they have areas of excellence such as ballistic and cruise missiles.  There's areas where they're making rapid progress, cyber and space."
"I think the report also suggests where they do need more work.  And -- and we do look at that as a department.  There are things that we do in terms of training, in terms of sophisticated integration of command and control and -- and intelligence, that they're not quite there yet.  The training is not as complex as ours."
"So there are things that -- that they would need to work on in order to achieve that status, but there are certainly areas where they've made a lot of progress and I -- I would describe as niche areas of excellence."
Q:  One -- one area you haven't mentioned is hypersonics.
"MR. SCHRIVER:  Well, our -- our report talks about it.  And we note that they've tested a hypersonic glide vehicle."
"It's certainly something that we're concerned about.  Our -- our budget request this year, for example, talks about need not only to defend against potential developments by other countries, but invest our own research and development in those areas."
So it's definitely something that we're tracking and trying to account for.
Q:  Is there an estimate for when it would become operational?
MR. SCHRIVER:  I don't have an estimate.
Q:  At what point will Chinese -- will the Chinese have as many advanced warships and submarines and large bombers as the United States?
"MR. SCHRIVER:  Well, in some instances, just the total numbers, it wouldn't be difficult for them to exceed.  But when you talk about the number of advanced -- so if you're talking about fifth-generation fighters versus fourth, or you talk about the new class of guided missile cruiser that's come online versus older platforms -- I'm not sure I can give you a precise answer on that."
"I mean, I think our hope is, through our own modernization, we maintain the competitive edge.  That what -- the first pillar of our National Defense Strategy is all about."
"And I would also note that the warfighting environment is changing.  We talk about that in our National Defense Strategy.  So our investment in some of these new domains, it may not be such a simple calculus in the future of how many platforms one side has or another.  It's about maintaining the technological edge, which we're committed to."
"STAFF:  Really -- really quick, Tony.  Just really quick.  Time for three more questions."
Q:  Does China have a nuclear triad?  You suggested in your report that the Jin class is operational.  Have they actually done deterrence patrols?  And is it accurate to say now China is one of the three nations on Earth with an operational nuclear triad?
"I -- I don't think I'd be prepared to use those words, but we're certainly tracking what they're doing with the -- with the ballistic-missile-carrying submarine.  And it looks as though, without get -- getting specific about a timeline that they're heading in that direction, so --"
Q:  Heading in what direction?
"MR. SCHRIVER:  Toward having -- having capable delivery systems in those three domains.  To have a true triad involves doctrine, it involves training, a lot of things.  So I'd -- I'd stay away from a specific point in time, but that's certainly something they're heading towards."
"Q:  Sir, Ben Kesling with the Wall Street Journal."
"You said that the -- the color of the hulls of the Chinese ships doesn't matter as much as the activity.  Does that mean that the U.S. military considers Chinese coast guard and Chinese People's Maritime Militia ships to be military vessels?  And if so, is that a -- is -- are they considered to be so at all times, or is there a threshold that they have to cross to be considered as such?"
"MR. SCHRIVER:  No.  As I said, it depends on the activity, with respect to how we regard them.  If they're engaged in provocation or infringement on another country's sovereignty, particularly our allies, then we would treat them differently than if they were doing what we would regard as more normal coast guard activities, or we don't have necessarily the equivalent of a maritime militia, but peaceful activities."
"So I'll just leave it at the statement I made.  We -- we are more concerned about the activity and the action, rather than the color of the hull."
Ma'am?
Q:  Lori Meyer with Washington Times.
So China has a significant involvement in Venezuela.  Are there significant matters about China's involvement that the department is concerned with?  And how is the department looking to counter such involvement?
"I -- I think I'll -- I'll leave the questions to Venezuela to, right now, our State Department and White House and our -- our Southern Command, which -- I know that the secretary just spoke to a group just before this session, so I'll leave it at that."
"Q:  Just a quick question:  You mentioned cost of militarization, of the outlook, and that China had not been invited to RIMPAC.  Do you see that continuing; that -- that down the road, China will not be invited to participate in RIMPAC this year or coming years down the road?"
And what other -- you mentioned other costs.  Is there some other type of costs that you see imminent?
"MR. SCHRIVER:  What I meant in that remark was that cost imposition is, sort of, part of the toolkit.  I don't know that there any plans to invite China to RIMPAC the next session of it.  But in the toolkit, we cannot only do the FONOPS, the presence operations, the capacity building, but cost imposition."
And it doesn't necessarily have to be on point:  China does something in the South China Sea; we do something in the South China Sea.  Cost imposition can be something else as long as we're tying it to their activity in the South China Sea in a way that they understand.
"STAFF:  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming out."
"Thank you, ASD Schriver.  I appreciate your time."
"If there are follow-up questions that you didn't get to, if there is someone that wasn't called on, please find me after.  We'll be back in the -- in the work spaces."

President Barack Obama today sent Congress a proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 Department of Defense budget request of $585.3 billion in discretionary budget authority to fund both base budget programs and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO).
"The FY 2016 base budget of $534.3 billion includes an increase of $38.2 billion over the FY 2015 enacted budget of $496.1 billion. DoD’s FY 2016 OCO budget of $50.9 billion is $13.3 billion – or about 21 percent – lower than the FY 2015 enacted level of $64.2 billion, reflecting the end of the combat mission and the continued drawdown of forces in Afghanistan. The combined request represents an increase of $24.9 billion or about four percent, reflecting the need to modernize the force for the future and respond to emerging security challenges."
"The FY 2016 budget supports the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) strategy, beginning with its three pillars: protect the homeland, build security globally, and project power and win decisively. The budget also reaffirms the five key priorities identified in the QDR. These include the rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region, a strong commitment to security and stability in Europe and the Middle East, a global approach to countering violent extremists, key investments in technology, and strengthening alliances and partnerships around the world.
	
	The budget proposes investments in the modernization of key capability areas, including nuclear deterrence, space, missile defense, cyber security, and power projection. The budget also resubmits a number of critical reforms proposed in the FY 2015 budget, including improvements to DoD business operations, force structure modifications, streamlining our base infrastructure, strengthening sexual assault prevention and response programs, and providing for service members and their families. The budget maintains a prudent balance among Joint force capacities, capabilities, and readiness, and continues to keep faith with service members and their families."
"As the department rebalances the joint force after 13 years of war, it confronts an uncertain fiscal environment in the absence of congressional action to reverse sequestration. The geopolitical events of the past year only reinforce the need to resource DoD at the president’s requested funding level as opposed to current law. As the budget makes clear, a return to sequester-level funding would be irresponsible and dangerous, resulting in a force too small and ill equipped to respond to the full range of potential threats to the nation."
"Highlights of the proposed DoD budget are outlined below and in the attached chart. The entire FY 2016 budget proposal is available at www.budget.mil. The department’s “FY 2016 Budget Request Overview Book” can be downloaded there as well. For more information, visit http://www.defense.gov/home/features/2015/0215_budget/."
Summary of the DoD Fiscal Year 2016 Budget Proposal
"The FY 2016 budget reaffirms the 2014 QDR strategy while taking account of recent destabilizing developments globally, including Russia’s aggressive actions in Europe and the threat posed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)."
"The budget request seeks $534.3B in base funding and $50.9 billion to fund Overseas Contingency Operations to combat diverse terrorist groups, to ensure a responsible transition in Afghanistan, and to balance today’s challenges with those we may face tomorrow at a time when potential competitors are developing advanced technologies and weapons to counter our traditional military strengths and our preferred ways of operating – particularly our ability to project power to any region of the world."
"
	The request also takes into account the strain that the military services have been under and the need to divest excess force structure in order to focus resources on high priority capability areas."
"
	
	Modernizing to Meet Emerging Requirements and Capabilities Shortfalls"
"The department’s investments in new technologies are designed to yield a force that achieves the nation’s security objectives and makes key investments to address challenges to U.S. technological superiority. The FY 2016 request continues an emphasis on improved lethality, survivability, sustainability, and affordability of next-generation weapons systems and equipment. The budget also invests in the vital capabilities highlighted in the QDR, including nuclear deterrence, space-based systems, power projection, missile defense, cyber security, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), and counterterrorism and special operations. Funding is requested for improved base resiliency, for space launch initiatives to develop an alternative domestic launch capability, and for advanced sensors, communications, and munitions."
"The FY 2016 request includes funding to purchase 57 Joint Strike Fighters ($10.6 billion), 16 P-8 aircraft ($3.4 billion), five E-2D aircraft ($1.3 billion), and development of the KC-46 tanker ($3.0 billion) and long range strike capacity ($1.2 billion)."
"Funding is also sought for nine new ships ($11.6 billion), the overhaul of the USS George Washington (CVN-73) ($678 million), Ohio replacement strategic submarine development ($1.4 billion), and improved littoral combat ship capabilities ($55 million).
	Additional funding is sought for investments in cyber security ($5.5 billion), for missile defense ground based interceptor reliability ($1.6 billion), for Army helicopter modernization ($4.5 billion), and for Reaper (MQ-9) procurement ($821 million)."
"
	Innovation and Reform"
"To promote continued innovation and reform and ensure that our forces can continue to operate anywhere, anytime, against any potential adversary, the FY 2016 budget request will also fund the Defense Innovation Initiative and its Long-Range Research and Development Planning Program -- including high speed strike weapons; an aerospace innovation initiative; railgun development; assured positioning, navigation, and timing; and high energy laser technology."
"Funds will also be devoted to a full review of DoD business and management systems and to improvements in financial auditability. During 2015, 90 percent of Defense resources will have budget statements under audit. Funding will also support Better Buying Power 3.0 to improve defense acquisition."
"
	
	Force Structure"
"The FY 2016 request preserves the major elements of the department’s force structure, which we assess as sufficient to execute the strategy. The budget proposes a modest reduction of 11,300 in total force military end strength in FY 2016 from current levels. The FY 2016 force structure is 1.3 million active duty end strength, 811,000 reserve component end strength, and 773,000 civilian full-time equivalents. The objective force remains 49 tactical fighter squadrons, 54 Army Brigade Combat Teams, 14 ballistic missile submarines, 450 ICBMs, 96 operational bombers (for a total of 154 overall), and a 304-ship Navy with 11 carriers."
"Organizationally, most of the requested funding for DoD is divided among the military departments: 23.7 percent ($126.5 billion) for the Army, 30.1 percent ($161.0 billion) for the Navy/Marine Corps, and 28.6 percent ($152.9 billion) for the Air Force. The rest of the proposed budget – 17.6 percent ($94.0 billion) – funds defense-wide programs and activities, which include the Defense Health Program, SOCOM, the intelligence agencies, the Missile Defense Agency, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and smaller DoD agencies."
"
	
	Readiness "
"The president’s request will enable America’s military services to continue their measurable – though fragile – progress in restoring full-spectrum readiness. The budget continues initiatives begun in the FY 2014 budget to transition from a force focused largely on current operations to one capable of meeting a broader set of missions. Investments in full-spectrum readiness will yield a more ready and capable force, one prepared to achieve mission objectives at any time or place."
"
	• For the Army, this means having the resources for a training plan that includes six additional fully ready brigade combat teams and full-spectrum training proficiency."
"• For the Navy, the FY 2016 budget will support maintenance periods that will make possible a healthy balance between presence and surge capability."
"• For the Marine Corps, the FY 2016 request will continue to grow crisis response capability and begins to address readiness issues of its non-deployed forces."
"• For the Air Force, the FY 2016 budget request will fully fund the Combat Air Force’s Flying Hours Program, which will support that service’s goal of achieving full-spectrum readiness for 80 percent of its combat forces by FY 2023."
"• For Special Operations Command (SOCOM), the FY 2016 budget increases flying hours program funding for Special Operations Forces (SOF) aviation, optimizes training and engagement opportunities, and fully mans SOF components at combatant commands."
"
	
	Continued Reform"
"The PB 2016 budget request resubmits important reform proposals from the PB 2015 budget. To make the most of limited resources, we are driving down the cost of doing business. Proposals include divestiture of the Air Force’s A-10 aircraft, a restructuring of Army aviation, authority for a new round of Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), and compensation reform."
"
	
	Compensation"
"Recognizing that the volunteer force is central to a strong U.S. military, the FY 2016 request keeps faith with the men and women in uniform and their families by continuing to provide a strong package of pay and benefits. The budget includes $0.7 billion in FY 2016 to fund a basic raise of 1.3 percent. The president’s budget also proposes a pay raise of 1.3 percent for federal civilians, including DoD civilians."
"In addition, the budget request acknowledges that personnel costs – including military pay and allowances, military healthcare, civilian pay, and family support -- account for half of the department’s budget. Those costs must be kept under control to allow the department to fund the required balance of force size, modernization, and readiness and training needed to meet the needs of today and tomorrow. As a result, the department is proposing steps in the FY 2016 request to slow the growth in military pay and health costs."
The request proposes to slow growth in the basic allowance for housing by requiring an additional four percent in out-of-pocket costs above the one percent authorized by Congress in FY 2015. Also proposed is a reduction in commissary operating costs and subsidy. Modest annual fees are recommended for TRICARE-for-Life coverage for retirees age 65 or older. Consolidation of TRICARE healthcare plans is also recommended with altered deductibles and co-pays to encourage greater efficiency. Additional changes are sought for the pharmacy co-pay structure to encourage use of mail order and generic drugs. These DoD proposals are similar to those submitted in the president’s FY 2015 budget proposal.
"
	It should be noted that these DoD proposals are entirely separate from, and were not informed by the work of, the recommendations of the independent Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC).
	Overseas Contingency Operations"
"The budget requests an additional $50.9 billion to support DoD’s Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) in FY 2016. The amount requested is well below the FY 2015 enacted OCO budget of $64.2 billion. It continues the decline in OCO funding needs that began after FY 2008, while reflecting continued operational demands on U.S. forces.
	Funding will support the continuing responsible transition in Afghanistan, including $3.8 billion for training and equipping of Afghan security forces to help sustain political, economic, and security gains in that country."
"Funds will also support continuing operations against ISIL, including $1.3 billion for the training and equipping of Iraqi forces and properly vetted members of the moderate Syrian opposition."
"Funding of $2.1 billion is requested for the Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund and $789 million for the European Reassurance Initiative, both of which were introduced in the FY 2015 OCO request and support urgent priorities."
"Another $7.8 billion is requested to fund the reset and retrograde of equipment used in military actions. With the end of the U.S. combat mission in Afghanistan, the administration will develop a plan to transition all enduring costs currently funded in the OCO budget to the base budget beginning in FY 2017 and ending by FY 2020. However, this transition will not be possible if the sequester-level discretionary spending caps remain in place."

"In one of the most significant tests of autonomous systems under development by the Department of Defense, the Strategic Capabilities Office, partnering with Naval Air Systems Command, successfully demonstrated one of the world’s largest micro-drone swarms at China Lake, California. The test, conducted in October 2016 and documented on Sunday’s CBS News program “60 Minutes”, consisted of 103 Perdix drones launched from three F/A-18 Super Hornets. The micro-drones demonstrated advanced swarm behaviors such as collective decision-making, adaptive formation flying, and self-healing."
"“I congratulate the Strategic Capabilities Office for this successful demonstration,” said Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, who created SCO in 2012. “This is the kind of cutting-edge innovation that will keep us a step ahead of our adversaries. This demonstration will advance our development of autonomous systems.”"
"“Due to the complex nature of combat, Perdix are not pre-programmed synchronized individuals, they are a collective organism, sharing one distributed brain for decision-making and adapting to each other like swarms in nature,” said SCO Director William Roper. “Because every Perdix communicates and collaborates with every other Perdix, the swarm has no leader and can gracefully adapt to drones entering or exiting the team.”"
"The demonstration is one of the first examples of the Pentagon using teams of small, inexpensive, autonomous systems to perform missions once achieved only by large, expensive ones. Roper stressed the department’s conception of the future battle network is one where humans will always be in the loop. Machines and the autonomous systems being developed by the DoD, such as the micro-drones, will empower humans to make better decisions faster. "
"Originally designed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology engineering students, the Perdix drone was modified for military use by the scientists and engineers of MIT Lincoln Laboratory starting in 2013. Drawing inspiration from the commercial smartphone industry, Perdix software and hardware has been continually updated in successive design generations. Now in its sixth generation, October's test confirmed the reliability of the current all-commercial-component design under potential deployment conditions—speeds of Mach 0.6, temperatures of minus 10 degrees Celsius, and large shocks—encountered during ejection from fighter flare dispensers."
"The “60 Minutes” segment also featured other new technology from across the Department of Defense such as the Navy’s unmanned ocean-going vessel, the Sea Hunter, and the Marine Corps’ Unmanned Tactical Control and Collaboration program."
"As SCO works with the military Services to transition Perdix into existing programs of record, it is also partnering with the Defense Industrial Unit-Experimental, or DIUx, to find companies capable of accurately replicating Perdix using the MIT Lincoln Laboratory design. Its goal is to produce Perdix at scale in batches of up to 1,000."

"Thanks, Raj. Thanks very much for that introduction. "
"Secretary Ash here from the state of Massachusetts, I like you already, Secretary Ash."
"OK. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks very much for joining us. It's great to be back in Cambridge today to open up the east coast node of the Defense Department's technology startup, the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental, DIUx. And with the Boston area's rich legacy of public service, not to mention its status today as a landmark hub of innovative thinking and innovative technology, we couldn't have picked a better place for our startup. "
"I created DIUx last year because one of my core goals as Secretary of Defense has been to build and in some cases rebuild the bridges between our national security endeavor at the Pentagon and America's wonderfully innovative and open technology community. That's important because we've had a long history of partnership, working together to develop and advance technologies like the internet, GPS, and before that satellite communication and the jet engine. Not only benefiting both our security and our society, but truthfully changing our entire world. And that cooperation among industry, the academy and government helped make our military what it is today, the finest fighting force the world has ever known. There's no one stronger and there's no one more capable, and that's a fact that every American ought to be proud of, and I certainly am. "
"But it's also a fact that our military's excellence isn't a birthright. It's not a guarantee. We can't take it for granted in the 21st century. We have to earn it again and again. And today, it's imperative we do so because we live in a changing and competitive world."
"Technology itself is an example of that change. When I began my career in physics years ago, most technology of consequence originated in America. And much of that was sponsored by the government, particularly the Department of Defense. And today, we're still major sponsors, but much more technology is commercial. The technology base is global, as Raj has noted, and other countries have been trying to catch up to the breakthroughs that for the last several decades made our military more advanced than any other. "
"Nations like Russia and China are modernizing their militaries to try to close the technology gap. And moreover, technologies once possessed by only the most formidable militaries have now gotten into the hands of previously less capable forces and even non-state actors. And at the same time, our reliance on things like satellites and the internet can lead to vulnerabilities that our adversaries are eager to exploit."
"So, to stay ahead of all these challenges, to stay the best, I've been pushing the Pentagon to think outside our five-sided box and invest aggressively in innovation of all kinds, technological, organizational, operational, and in the talent management of our all- volunteer force. "
"One way we're doing that is by pushing the envelope with R&D and new technologies. Like data science, biotech, cyber defense, electronic warfare, undersea drones and many, many, many others. And we're making some serious investments here. The latest budget I've proposed will invest $72 billion in research and development next year alone. And for context, that's more than double what Intel, Apple and Google spent on R&D last year combined."
"Another way we're investing in innovation is through people. We're building what I call on-ramps and off-ramps for technical talent to flow in both directions. So more of America's brightest minds can contribute to our mission of national defense, even if only for a time, or for a project. And so our military and civilian technologists for their part in the innovative defense industry that supports us already can interact in new ways with the entire innovative ecosystem. "
"Innovative technologies and people are necessary but not sufficient which is why we're also investing in innovative practices and organizational structures. The world we live in demands it. While the Cold War arms race was characterized by strength with the leader simply having more, bigger and better weapons; into today's era of technological competition is characterized by the additional variables of speed and agility. Leading the race now depends on who can out innovate faster than anyone else. It's no longer just a matter of what we buy, now more than ever it also matters how we buy things. How quickly we buy them, whom we buy them from. And how quickly and creatively we can adapt and use them in different and innovative ways. All this to stay ahead of future threats and future enemies. And to ensure we keep adopting more innovative practices in the future, I recently created the New Defense Innovation Board chaired by Google Alphabet's Eric Schmidt to advise me and future Defense Secretaries on how to continue building bridges to the technology community and how we continue to change to be more competitive. More on that in a few minutes. "
"Finally, one more way we're investing in innovation is by developing new partnerships with the private sector across America's many great hubs of unrivaled innovation. Places like Austin, Seattle, Silicon Valley and of course right here in Boston."
And that's where DIUx comes in. And that's why I'm here. 
"Over the last 11 months – since we first opened the doors of the West Coast office in Silicon Valley – DIUx has been a signature part of our outreach to the tech community. It's helped us connect with hundreds of entrepreneurs and firms – making great progress in putting commercially-based innovation into the hands of America's soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines. And it's helped us learn a lot too – identifying not only our successes but also our shortcomings. Both in how we engage with tech companies and in the tools we use to accelerate the uptake of technology in the Department of Defense."
"So two-and-a-half months ago we put that knowledge into practice. We took a page straight out of the startup play book by iterating rapidly and then launching DIUx 2.0 with several new features. It now reports directly to my office. It has its own contracting capability and budget resources. It has a new flatter partnership-style leadership structure led by managing partner Raj Shah – F-16 pilot and co-founder of successful technology startup. And with the opening of this office here in Boston, we've made in the DIUx 2.0 a nationwide release."
"Now, over the last 10 weeks, Raj and his team have been very busy. First of all, they've reorganized DIUx into three teams."
"They have an Engagement team which not only introduces the military to entrepreneurs but also – and more importantly – introduces entrepreneurs to military problems. We have some of the most exciting and consequential problems you get can in technology in our department and in our mission. Combined with our mission of defending this country, that's one of the strongest attractors for innovators and technologists who want to make a difference in the world. So the Engagement team is critical."
"DIUx also has a Foundry team, which works with technology that's either still maturing or that might need to be significantly adapted before we can use it. To do this effectively, they've launched a Warfighter-in-Residence program and an Entrepreneur-in-Residence program which bring together servicemen and women detailed from across the military with top engineers contracted from outside the military for focused design sprints, rapid prototyping and field trials. One of the first things they're doing is exploring the potential military applications of virtual and augmented reality technologies, which will continue to mature as tech companies’ major investments in these areas come to fruition. They'll also work on new applications for commercial space technologies, advanced aerial robotics and autonomous vehicles."
"The third and largest team is the Venture team, which is tasked with identifying emerging commercial technologies and exploring their applicability to potential military and civilian customers across the department. "
"Now, while they might sound familiar, I have to emphasize that there's a critical difference between what DIUx's Venture team does and what a venture capital firm does.: instead of making equity investments, the venture team makes R&D awards. But they're able to work with anyone, from two people in a garage or a dorm room all the way up to mature tech companies. They operate on a co-investment model – On any project that DIUx moves forward with, they aim to match funding and staffing resources with a customer organization within DOD. That way, they can ensure not only that the product meets the customer's needs, but also that they have a partner to drive post-prototype transition. "
"With these three teams – Engagement, Foundry and Venture -- it's important to note the value that DIUx 2.0 has to offer our department. Because of its tech scouting prowess and deep network with the technology and venture capital community, DIUx has a unique ability to identify and do business with companies outside our traditional defense orbit, including many so-called stealth startups that aren't even officially opened for business yet. This significantly enlarges our defense industrial base and helps existing DOD components who partner with DIUx to locate cutting-edge and best-in-breed technology, whether in a garage in Silicon Valley, a lab in Boston or a successful firm that's never worked with us before. And by rapidly capitalizing on that, DIUx can help the rest of DOD move much faster, delivering the fruits of America's unparalleled technology economy to the warfighter in weeks and months rather than years."
"That ability – to move at the speed of business is possible because the DIUx 2.0 team pioneered a new and an innovative method for defense acquisition. They did this working with experts from the Army Contracting Command New Jersey at Picatinny Arsenal – especially one of Picatinny's key leaders, Paul Milenkowic, who's here today – where is Paul? Where did you go, Paul?"
"Raise your hand, Paul. You're supposed to be up here. "
"Paul, well done. "
"They developed what they call a commercial solutions opening, which leverages expanded acquisition authorities for prototyping that Congress could fund last fall. "
"Here's how it works: To start, DIUx posts on their website a particular problem we need to solve that we think might have a commercially based solution – maybe we want to find a way to patch unknown cyber vulnerabilities in our networks, maybe we're looking for a way to quickly scale up production of the 3D printed micro drones that we're developing."
"Next, any interested company can share information on their technologies and how they propose to solve the problem. And if they're invited to, they then pitch their solutions to the DIUx partners, using the same pitch deck and short concept papers they use to pitch their venture capital firms or their private sector customers. It's a merit-based competition that's truly accessible. Any startup or commercial firm could submit a proposal. "
"From there, things can move very, very quickly. Once the most promising solution is identified, DIUx can then negotiate and execute fast, flexible, and collaborative awards with the goal to issue funding within 60 days of a first meeting with the company. And later, if the military customer is satisfied and wants to move to follow-on production, they can do so much more swiftly as well."
"This new approach is already generating lots of enthusiasm. Our military services, combatant commands and defense agencies like the speed and the agility it affords. Tech companies like that they can work with DIUx to design projects jointly, negotiate appropriate agreement clauses – including those concerning intellectual property rights – and move rapidly to make adjustments as needed. And there's value for everyone in being able to start with a problem set and a few perimeters, rather than having to meet a specific laundry list of predetermined and sometimes rigid capability requirements, which is how it usually works in defense acquisition. At DIUx, companies get the freedom to engage in the discovery process, which is often the most interesting part, and customers get more innovative solutions. "
"And more important than enthusiasm, this is generating results. Within five weeks on the job, Raj and his team developed and launched the Commercial Solutions Opening to begin work on 15 separate prototyping projects. And the first agreement was signed in only 31 days with a company named Halo Neuroscience. They've invented a wearable device that looks like a pair of headphones and uses non-invasive electrical stimulation to increase the brain's natural ability to adapt to training. These headsets will be used by teams from our special operations forces who will work with Halo to gauge how effective their device might be to improving marksmanship, close-quarters combat skills and overall strength training."
"And that's just the first project on the books – many more projects are expected to be finalized in the next few weeks, covering diverse technology areas ranging from secure network mapping to autonomous seafaring drones. And seven of their newest problem sets were posted in the last two weeks to develop projects for network end point inspection, high speed drone and multi-factor authentication, among others."
"So, the DIUx pipeline is brimming with possibility. And I expect this portfolio will continue to grow – and even more so because of our new presence here in Boston and the new people we recruited to lead it."
"First is Bernadette Johnson, who many of you know from her years as Chief Technology Officer at MIT's Lincoln Lab. She'll be DIUx's Chief Science Officer, ensuring the technical integrity of its projects and serving as chief liaison to our dozens of DOD and industry labs and other R&D organizations across the department."
"She'll be joined here by Air Force Reserve Colonel Mike McGinley. In civilian life, Mike is a lawyer specializing in cybersecurity. In uniform, he's been our leader of our Cyber Command's private sector partnership team – until now, that is, because Mike will be going on active duty and serving as military lead for the Boston office. And along with another senior partner to be named later this year, Bernadette and Mike will join Raj and the partners based out west to manage DIUx's efforts across the country. "
"That last part is important. DIUx has to be engaged nationwide because no two innovation ecosystems are alike. Each has its own unique value and expertise. And wherever innovation is happening, we need to be able to tap into it, and Boston is a perfect example of that. "
"In addition to being a hub of east coast economic growth, Boston is a beehive of activity for biotechnology and the biosciences. I think in decades to come, we'll look back and view the I.T. revolution as having been the recent past. The present and the future being also a revolution in the biosciences. We in DOD want to be part of that as well, because even though we don't have quite as much of a legacy here as we do in I.T. and aerospace, we know it can have a tremendous impact on the health and welfare and effectiveness of our troops. So that's part of the future we have to help build – together with our partners in industry and academia, as we always have. "
"And that's why I'm also announcing that DIUx is exploring ways to bring leading minds in the military and DOD to work on bio-defense and biological technology, together with world-class academic researchers, biotech companies and entrepreneurs, including those right here in Boston, like Eric Lander and the Broad Institute and others. And I look forward to their findings, so we can ensure that DOD is fully aware of the biosciences revolution that we're just beginning to live through. "
"Like San Francisco, Austin, Seattle, and so many other places, Boston is a technology hub of great importance – an ecosystem of companies, university and research institutions that exemplifies America's unrivaled innovative culture. And it's especially prominent in the union of biosciences, engineering and data, areas that together could yield new ways to fight infectious diseases, for example, or help develop new materials capable of regenerating, responding to their environment, or learning, evolving – all properties never seen before in human-made substances."
"Of course, the outcome of this will be just one of many ways we'll measure the success of DIUx. "
"The most important metric will be how much new technology is delivered to the hands of our troops. A high return on investment will mean improved warfighter capability, with innovative technologies being not only demonstrated, but incorporated into regular defense acquisition programs of record. That will require more companies that might not look for defense business getting into our game and also established defense companies having more access to talent. "
"We'll also gauge success in terms of access to technology leaders, the strength of relationships over time, and the ability to use these relationships to advance DOD missions – including the extent to which they take advantage of our on-ramps and off-ramps for technology talent, or perhaps create new ones. And in the long run, we'll look at how many DOD components adopt DIUx practices…particularly nontraditional acquisition mechanisms like the Commercial Solutions Opening. If DIUx is truly successful in catalyzing broader interaction between DOD and non-traditional technology firms as I'm confident it will be, then it will eventually put itself out of business since the department as a whole will be doing what DIUx is doing today."
"In fact we'd welcome that outcome because DIUx is, after all, an experiment as well as a path finder. We created it so we could try new approaches; learn what works and what doesn't. And iterate until we get it right. And we'll keep iterating together and learning from each other as we go forward."
"That brings me back to the Defense Innovation Board which I've charged with keeping DOD imbued with a culture of innovation in people, organizations, operations and technology…to support people who innovate, those creative figures in our department who are willing to try new things, fail fast, and iterate. And also to ensure that we're always doing everything we can to stay ahead of potential adversaries."
"And I have to say that Eric Schmidt has done a great job helping put together the rest of the board. In recent weeks I've announced some of the other members – including Reid Hoffman, the head of LinkedIn; University of Texas Chancellor and former commander of our Special Operations Command, Admiral Bill McRaven; and the noted historian of innovation Walter Isaacson. And today I'm announcing other amazing innovators who will join them. Leaders and thinkers who represent a cross-section of America's most innovative industries and organizations. "
"From the private sector we have Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos; Code for America's founder and Executive Director Jennifer Pahlka: Google's Vice President for Access Services, Broadband and Fiber Network, pioneer Milo Medin; Instagram CEO Marty Levine and United Technologies Senior Vice President for Science and Technology Mike McQuade. And they'll also be joined by several distinguished thinkers about innovation and technology including the Wharton School's Organizational Psychology Professor Adam Grant; Caltech Dynamical Systems and Bioengineer Professor Richard Murray; Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson; and three landmark innovators from right here in Cambridge: Harvard Legal Scholar Cass Sunstein; Computer Theorist, MIT Professor and co-founder of Applied Innovation Danny Hillis, and the President and Founding Director of the Broad Institute, Eric Lander."
"Some of the board members have already begun their preliminary work. Earlier this month they spent time with airmen in Nevada, sailors in San Diego and today they're meeting with soldiers in Fort Bragg where I'll join tomorrow, and visiting our Central Command and Special Operations Command Headquarters in Tampa. And they'll continue to work over the summer."
"At the outset I've given them the very specific task of identifying innovative, private sector, best practices that might be of use to us in the DOD – not unlike our recent ""Hack the Pentagon"" pilot program which invited hackers to help find vulnerabilities in our networks, similar to the Bug Bounties that several of Americas leading tech companies have.  While this approach to crowdsourcing cybersecurity is fairly widespread in the private sector, ours was the first in the entire federal government. And was so successful we're expanding it to other parts of DOD. This is a way in which you get the white hats to explore your attack surface rather than the black hats. They do it because they love their country or they want the thrill of the reward and it's extremely effective. We'd never done it before and we just did it. Perfect example of the kind of thing I'm looking for for the Innovation Board to recommend. We can't use all the ideas that everybody uses outside of the department, but there are going to be many that we can."
"Not everything in the private sector will make sense for us because we're always mindful the military isn't a company, it's a profession of arms. And for important reasons, we're not always going to be able to do things the same way, but that doesn't mean we can't look ourselves in the mirror and look around the country for new ideas and lessons we can learn for ways we can operate more efficiently. So the board will recommend a first slate of innovative practices by the fall, in time for me to review and determine which ones make sense for us to adopt."
"All of this is important because as we refocus on maintaining our enduring technological dominance in a new era – which is something we have to do in addition to all that we're doing today – crushing and defeating ISIL, countering Russia, China, maintaining deterrence on the Korean Peninsula, countering Iran's malign influence, everything else we have to do today. In addition to all that, we recognize that DOD, we must be innovative in the future in order to stay ahead of all our competitors. That's why I created the Defense Innovation Board and DIUx in the first place – to challenge our enterprise, to bring in new ideas, to open our doors to new partners and to push our existing bureaucracy to do better rather than keep doing the same things it's always done."
"As I mentioned earlier, our defense budget for next year makes breakthrough investments in a range of high-end capabilities – investments we need to stay ahead of potential opponents. But just as it's easy for us in DOD to default to the status quo, so also it is easy for Congress to do the same – to buy the same things they've always bought for us or to put up roadblocks to the organizational innovations that we need in order to disrupt and challenge and inspire the rest of our department to change for the better."
"We can't accomplish what we're trying to do in DOD without a willing partner in Congress, and I'm hopeful Congress will join us in trying to break away from the status quo, break out of our ruts and help keep our military the best and most capable in the world – so we can continue to keep America safe and secure. And I'm grateful to those in our partner committees that have done so, and there are many, and I hope others will get on board quickly."
"I want to close by saying this is a very exciting time. For those interested in foreign policy and national security, there are lots of interesting challenges and problems to work on. And it's also true for those interested in technology, but the intersection of the two is an opportunity-rich environment."
"Let me explain what I mean by that, though, because there are opportunities for partnership in every challenge we face. "
"Right now, as we sit here today, our men and women in uniform are working with partners from our worldwide coalition in more ways and with more and more power every day to accelerate the defeat of ISIL, which we will surely do, but we want to do soon. They're also training with our NATO allies in Europe to deter Russian aggression. They're sailing the waters of the Asia-Pacific as part of a principled and inclusive network of nations, ensuring that the most consequential region for America's future remains stable, secure and prosperous for all nations. They're standing guard 24/7 on the Korean Peninsula and countering Iran's malign influence against our friends and allies in the Middle East. And all the while, they're helping protect our homeland"
"In each of these missions, you can make a difference. Because whether it's machine learning technology that might be able to recognize and block ISIL's barbaric attack plotting on social media…or algorithms to help a self-driving boat track submarines…or biotech research that could one day help our troops recover from injury faster, technology is a critical part of everything we do. And it's critical to addressing every strategic challenge facing us today. "
"That's why DIUx matters. It has to do with our protection and our security, creating a world where people can live their lives, and dream their dreams and give their children a better future."
The importance of that never has been lost on the people of Boston. And I'm not just talking about the Minutemen.
"Think about the many members of Red Sox Nation who went on to serve our entire nation – from Ted Williams, who was a Marine Corps fighter pilot during the Korean War, to our Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff today, General Joe Dunford, who was born in South Boston and grew up in Quincy."
"Think about the Kennedy brothers, stories of heroism and sacrifice during World War II, and then consider the generations of Kennedy School grads who studied under Graham Allison."
"Think about the technologists at MIT, when decades past, developed computer navigation systems that not only guided ballistic missiles but also landed men on the moon…and then about their contemporaries at Lincoln Labs, Draper, MITRE and Raytheon, who continue to push the boundaries of what's possible."
This city is home to a tremendous legacy of service – one that will continue in a new way with DIUx. It's a testament to the fact that Boston has always been a place where great minds and great ideas come together to help advance the safety and security of our country. That's what we do every day in the Department of Defense.
"Contributing to that mission – helping defend your country and make a better world is one of the noblest things that a business leader, or a technologist, or an entrepreneur or a young person can do. And we're grateful to all of you here for your interest in doing that with us. "
Thank you.

"Thank you.  Well, I would just like to start by saying, and with apologies to the CNO who wrote an article on this today that Washington traffic is the most effective A2/AD network in the world."
"     I very much apologize for keeping you waiting.  And so I want to just dive right in.  I want to thank the AUSA, Secretary Fanning, General Milley, General Perkins for this opportunity.  I am honored to be invited here and speak with this important forum and with an organization that has done so much to support our remarkable American Army."
"     Now, in talking to General Perkins about what he wanted me to try to do today, he just asked me to kind of set the stage for the future operating environment as we see it and talk in terms of the reconceptualization and concept development that is occurring right now within the joint force and throughout the joint force."
"Over 27 years since the Cold War's ended, and as demonstrated convincingly in Operation Desert Storm, Operation Allied force, the conventional campaign and Operation Iraqi Freedom, the United States has enjoyed a remarkable run of unparalleled conventional dominance at both the tactical and operational levels of war.  During this period, we have had generally unimpeded freedom of action, access on the land, in the air, on the sea."
"     But now, competitors such as big competitors, like Russia and China, medium-sized regional powers like Iran and North Korea, they're developing capabilities and challenges and they contest us in all domains now; cyberspace, space, air, land, sea, under seas.  And this threatens to erode not only our operational advantage, but in some cases, our technological superiority and overmatch, which then impacts our ability to project powers over trans-oceanic distances."
"     Now, addressing this challenge is, in my view, one of the most if not the most important challenges facing the Department of Defense, and that is why Secretary Carter has directed us to take concrete steps to remain at the forefront of operational and tactical excellence, and changing the way we plan, changing the way we innovate, changing the way we invest and most importantly changing the way we fight."
"     Now, I don't have to convince this crowd among all the crowds that I talk to that war is won by humans and not technology, but at least since World War II, it is incontrovertible that our national security strategy and our national defense strategy has assumed that we will enter the battle with superior technology, or at least technology that is better than our competitors, and we will be better trained and our individuals will be higher caliber."
"     And you don't have to take my word for this.  This started in World War II with General George C. Marshall, who said after the war, the vastly superior industrial establishment of the United States eventually overcame the initial advantages of the enemy.  We dared to mount operations all over the world with a strategic inferiority and troops through superiority and mobility and firepower."
"Now, for the historians in this group, what he was referring to was his famous 90 division gamble.  Right after the war started, planners said how big of an army are we going to need to fight this global war?  The answer came back 213 divisions and 273 air groups, but Marshall bet, and he admitted this was a gamble, that he thought the material superiority as well as the mobility, the superior mobility, coupled with far-reaching heavy fisted air arm would allow the United States to fight the war with 90 divisions instead of 213."
"In the end, he approved the air -- the goal of the 273 air groups.  Now, this gamble was a close-run thing.  As all -- as you most probably know, in the winter of 1944 in the European theater of operations, we literally ran out of infantrymen.  But in the end, the superior training, leadership, skill, tactical ingenuity and tenaciousness of the American soldier made this gamble pay off."
"     The same thinking animated President Eisenhower in his “New Look” strategy, where he basically said, I will invest in a smaller army armed with battlefield nuclear weapons and backed up by tactical fighters that would deliver tactical nukes against deep targets."
"Now, we can debate today on whether that was the same strategy.  The Army debated throughout the '50s that it was not, and in the end, President Kennedy agreed with the Army and introduced the strategy of flexible response which called for a larger army, and not so much, you know, use of tactical nuclear weapons.  But without question, through the 1970's, our conventional defense of Europe assumed that we would -- might have to go to tactical nukes early in the fight, especially once the United States became tied down in Vietnam."
"     But coming out of Vietnam, we had three problems, and these three problems are exactly -- not exactly, never exactly -- but pretty darn close to analogous to what we face today."
"     First, the Soviets had achieved nuclear parity at the time and had developed new operational concepts specifically designed to upset the new look strategy.  They would attack by successive echelons against the NATO frontline.  At that time, I think it is called people so the FEBA, so the forward edge of the battle area.  They'd effect a penetration, an operational maneuver group would pound through, go deep in NATO's rear, and the judgment was the Soviets could do that faster than NATO leaders could agree on the use of nuclear weapons."
     So our conventional deterrent was completely undermined.  It just was no longer credible.
"Second, throughout the 1960s, the Soviets had spent a lot of money on improving their tactical equipment, and the 1973 war showed that the character of war was changing, exactly what Chief Milley is saying.  In '73, the T-62 was pretty darn close to the M-60 that we were using, the SA-6 surface-to-air missiles wrested air superiority from one of the finest air forces in the world for three days, until a ground maneuver was able to break open up that network and wire guided antitank missiles really, really were a problem for Israeli armor."
"U.S. Army sent teams over to the deserts and they said, wow, the lethality of the modern battlefield is far above anything that we are used to.  In fact, retired general Bob Scales said the '73 war was the first evidence of the precision revolution in warfare applied to ground combat.  The message was pretty clear, the character of war, had changed significantly, and if we got into a fight in the European front, it could be a big, big problem for us."
"     Third, we didn't have a lot of money.  We were coming out of Vietnam, so there were -- we didn't have a lot of freedom of action when it comes to budgets.  So again, parity at the nuclear level, new operational concepts which start to upend the way we -- our operational design, tactical, kind of equivalence, and then finally low resources.  So the response really bears remembering because I'm going to come back to it really quickly."
"We concluded that a smaller ground force backed by technology and honed by training could still form the foundation of a credible conventional deterrent.  This smaller force would be all volunteer, and would be guided by a doctrinal renaissance with a focus at the operational level of war.  Tactical superiority would be restored by fielding the big five: the M1 tank, the Bradley infantry fighting vehicle, the Black Hawk helicopter, the Apache attack helicopter, and the Patriot missile, and by owning the night."
"And we would hone the skills of the smaller force through hard, realistic training in places like a national training center and red flag.  Now meanwhile up at OSD, Secretary of Defense Harold Brown and his AT&L, is what is now called the Undersecretary Defense for AT&L -- it wasn't then -- but they were going to focus on the operational level of war also, and they envisioned an operational level battle network: a sensor grid, a C3I Grid, and an affects grid, all interconnected."
"     And that operational level battle network would allow us to solve the problem of the successive echelons.  We would look deep and shoot deep, and we would rely upon the tactical ingenuity, skill, and tenaciousness of the American soldier on the FEBA. "
"We demonstrated this in a demonstration called ""Assault Breaker"" in 1982, but here is the key, and it is directly associated with this panel.  Long before the assault breaker demonstrated the technology, the Army was creating a new operational construct focused again at the campaign level, the operational level of war.  They took the lessons of the Yom Kippur war in they said, you're right, the character of war is changing."
"     And they were driven by the imperative to find outnumbered and win.  TRADOC Commander Donn Starry, teamed with Air Force General Bill Creech, to develop what we now look back upon and called AirLand Battle, integrating fires and maneuvers at both the operational and the tactical level of war.  And when meshed with the technologies that came out of the assault breaker demonstration, the result was an astounding increase in combat effectiveness that has served us well to this day."
"Now we demonstrated this at Desert Storm in a very nascent state, and it was a wake-up call for all of our competitors.  This crowd knows warfare is a dynamic interactive endeavor, that's warfare 101.  We shouldn't have expected her adversaries to sit still and they certainly haven't.  So now we are faced with much of the same situation that the U.S. Army in the joint force faced in 1973.  This is what we need to now offset once again."
"     Most of our combat power resides now in the continental United States or on U.S. territory.  We can no longer assume that we will have large forces in theaters, they are expected to fight, and this will give a potential adversary an advantage in the initiative time and forces initially."
"     Second, our largest state adversaries will have achieved rough parity in battle networks and guided munitions.  This will make movement to the theater and movement within the theater more difficult; not impossible, just much more difficult than we're used to.  And third, because our adversaries know the fearsome power of our battle networks, they have invested a lot of money in counter network technologies like electronic warfare and cyber.  And so these are changing, once again, I could not agree more with the chief.  The character of war is changing once again. "
"     And as I said, make no mistake about it, this is a big strategic issue because it threatens our ability to project power across the oceans, which is the very foundation of our conventional deterrent."
"Now, like the 1973 war, Russian operations in both Ukraine and Syria have given us a glimpse of how this might play out on the tactical battlefield.  I want to make absolutely clear to everyone here, we are not planning to fight a war against Russia, but it would be foolish not to pay attention to their operations because they are quite frankly, a pacing competitor that tells us where we need to go to make sure that we have operational and tactical superiority."
"     And I know General Perkins, HR McMaster and his team are looking at these lessons very, very carefully.  The Russians have effectively employed cross domain fires using a variety of long-range guided munitions from the air, sea, and under the sea.  They have improved the accuracy and responsiveness of their already formidable indirect fire skills, using artillery and rockets guided by UAVs, cyber, Sigint and ELINT right on the forward line of troops."
"     Russian-backed separatists have jammed GPS frequencies, communications and imaging radars, so not only will our future Army have to fight on the battlefield swept by precision munitions, but it's going to be swept by persistent and very effective VW and cyber threats."
"The old adage was back in the second offset, if you can be seen, you can be hit and if you can hit, you can be killed.  The new adage is, if you emit, you die.  So during the last 15 years of war, the greatest threat that we have really faced was from below, the IED, a simple but very devastating weapon.  But in this future battlefield, we will be faced with precision guided fire from above and a direct line of sight, and all sorts of different capabilities that we haven't faced.  And we still have the Big Five."
     We don't have enough money to replace the Big Five.  We're spending money to update them but we're going to have to keep them a while.  So we find ourselves in this very similar broken terrain.  Our adversaries are close to parody at the operational level. 
"     They've demonstrated, at the tactical level, new capabilities we have to be aware of and there's not a lot to be enthusiastic about, our resources at this point.  So it's time to get busy and I'm proud to say that the army has really been getting after it.  I went up to the army work college last year and I said look, technology is one thing and there's all sorts of technological advances we can do.  But if that technology is not guided and shaped by good, operational constructs, concepts and organizational constructs, it just isn't going to work."
"And I challenged the army at that time, would you please start thinking about Air-Land battle 2.0.  But thankfully, General Perkins and General McMaster didn't listen to me, they knew that I was barking up the wrong tree.  They looked beyond Air-Land Battle to envision war in what General Perkins called multi-domain battle with cross-domain fires.  On a battlefield swept by precision guided munitions, you've got about two options."
"You can dig in and immobilize yourself hoping you survive or you disperse, stay mobile and fire and manuever to gain advantage.  And you're going to have to do that maneuver across all operational domains.  Multi-domain battle chooses maneuver in all these domains.  Both the service and create windows of opportunity to enable the joint force freedom of maneuver and to allow them to achieve effects on the battlefield.  Past campaign plans have called for an extensive roll back campaign against A2AD type technologies so that we could get the rest of the Joint Force in."
"But Multi-Domain Battle envisions a future where you synchronize cross-domain fires and maneuver in all the domains to achieve physical, temporal and positional advantages.  So as the CNO often says, it allows us to look at A2AD networks, or whatever we will call them in the future, not as a solid block of cheddar cheese but a block of Swiss cheese with a lot of discrete holes that we can exploit.  Adversaries think they can keep us out, I'm here to tell you they are absolutely wrong."
"     We will mass effects from the air, from the sea, from the ground, from under the sea and we will quite frankly pound the snot out of them from range and in the close fight.  Now Multi-Domain Battle and cross-domain fires get at the very heart of the changing character of war and how ground forces will be central, as they always have been, in the joint war fight.  They will operate within what we call joint collaborative human machine battle networks at the operational level of war that will provide us an enormous advantage there."
"     We hope that all of the focus on readiness and training on the high end and the advances are the improvements we can make to the Big Five, well, we're not hoping, we're counting on it and we're absolutely confident that at the tactical level of war, our soldiers are going to outmatch anybody they face. "
"     But we're going to move what this does, what General Perkins and General McMaster have been talking about, is that we're going to move beyond a mere synchronization of joint capabilities to the complete integration of capabilities where anti-air capabilities might be coming from a surge submarine or anti-ship cruise missiles might be coming from an army unit on the ground."
"     There are so many different ways that we can create dilemmas for our adversaries that if we seize the opportunity, we will be just fine.  I also see another grand alliance, I'm glad to see that General Goldfein is here sitting next to General Perkins.  General Goldfein has said that we have to have a new conception of command and control in these joint collaborative human machine battle networks because command and control must be multi-domain, multi-functional, coalition friendly and often trans-regional and he's taken that on as one of his top three priorities as a chief to think that through."
"     And just like the Army and the Air Force came together for Air-Land Battle, I think it's absolutely critical that the Army and the Air Force and the Navy by the way that has really advanced thinking about tactical battle networks et cetera and the Marines who are still thinking innovatively about operational maneuver from the sea, multi-domain battle really is where we need to go.  So it's time to get after this.  I'm not certain that multi-domain battle, as it's expressed today, is going to be the final solution. "
"I can look back in the 1985, 1985, the Army adopted Active Defense but within two years they said, look Air-Land Battle is a better way to do this.  That's the signature of the U.S. Army.  Doctrinal innovation and if they don't think that's going to work, they're going to go to something that does.  And once they have that doctrinal innovation, they train, train, train, and they train better and they field capabilities faster than our opponents."
"Look, anybody could have bought night vision goggles in 1977, 1978.  But the Army said, we're going to own the night and it was all the TTP's, the tactics, techniques and procedures and the training that allowed them to own the night.  So when people say, oh somebody might get technology faster than us, I say, OK but will they be able to employ it in an operational, effective way?  And I bet on the U.S. Army and the U.S. Joint Force, we will get there faster than them."
"Now the Army has a long history of war gaming and experimentation, whether it's the famous Louisiana maneuvers of the 1940's, the 11th AASLT division of the 60's, the light infantry division experiments of the 80's, the fourth I.D. and the digitization experiments in the 90's, the Army after next program, look we're confident the Army can get after it but we also know that resources are tight.  So we've established a war fighting lab incentives fund so if the Army comes up and says, we'd like to do this demonstration, we can come up with maybe 2 million.  If we could use another two, that fund is designed to let the Army get after it."
"     So let me say a millionth time, I say it all the time, the third offset is not about technology per say.  It is about the operational concepts and organizational constructs that will shape the way we use technology.  And there is no better organization in the world that thinks about this than the United States Army."
"And let me say that Secretary Carter and I have absolute confidence that we can do this for one reason, and that is because one thing that never changes, whether it's in World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, Desert Storm, Operation Iraqi Freedom, it doesn't matter, it's the quality of our people.  Look, this force does things that Second Lieutenant Work in 1975 couldn't even conceive of and the Army is now conceiving what that next great leap will be."
"     And I am extremely excited to hear this because nothing gets me more energized than advancements at the operational level of war, which is, as the Army has always said, that's where you have to keep your eyeballs on."
"     So Amy, General Perkins, all I can say is drive on.  This is exciting time.  Just like we own the night, I want you to tell us how we're going to own the electromagnetic night.  I want to know how we do multi-domain battle.  I want to understand how command-and-control has to change because those things -- when those questions are answered, we will -- you will start to see investments flow that way because of force imbued with Army values, trained hard and allowed to operate under the widest latitude possible, will always outperform a force tied to a rigid command structure in an authoritarian dogma."
"     Our training and professional development must be tailored to empower our people, exploit the technology, but most importantly achieve operational and tactical effects using really smart thinking."
"     So I'm really looking forward to this panel.  I won't be able to stay for the entire time, but I'd like to commend AUSA for having the panel.  I'd like to commend the Army for their far-reaching thinking.  I'd like to commend all of the services because I'm telling you right now, there hasn't been a situation like this in quite some time, where every one of the services are involved in such deep thought about operational and tactical innovation."
"     So again, thank you all to you here -- those here in the audience and I can't wait to hear what comes out of the panel.  Thank you."
"     Now, because I may have to leave, General Perkins has asked me to answer just one or two questions because I already arrived a little late.  I will be happy to do so.  If there are no questions, I am happy to sit down.  So if anybody has a question, I have time for one or maybe two."
"     Yes, sir?"
"     Q:  You didn't mention about autonomous systems.   In light of the third off-set strategy, what is your thinking about letting in the future autonomous systems make lethality decisions without a human in the loop?"
"     MR. WORK:  I purposely didn't talk a lot about the technology behind the third off-set because in a audience like this, you get that the most important thing is the operational concepts and the organizational constructs that employ that technology."
"     But let me state this -- state it this way.  There will be some instances where operations are happening at machine speeds and we will have to rely upon A.I. and autonomy to actually fight.  Three of them come immediately to mind; cyber attacks, electronic warfare attacks and heavy guided missile salvo attacks.  In each of those three cases, we will have to delegate authority to the machines to make the final decisions. "
"     In every case that I can think of in terms of offensive operations, we will use machines to empower the human and not vice versa.  Our competitors may go in a different way.  Authoritarian regimes see every single person inside their organization as a potential liability, because if the supreme commander says take this hill and if the squad leader on the ground says I can achieve better affects by taking that hill, that is not something they would want.  And we know this because the conception of the Soviet reconnaissance strike complex was ultimately to be totally automated."
"     Our battle networks will empower humans.  Humans will make the decisions on lethality, humans will make the decision on campaign design, humans will make the decision on tactical courses of action.  So this is not about Skynet and Terminator."
"     This is about Iron Man.  Really, think about Iron Man.  This is human.  This is machines helping the human achieve effects."
     One last question and then I have got to cede the field.  Did you have a question there?  You were standing by the mic.  Why don't you ask a question?
"     Q:  I'm good, sir.  Thank you."
"     MR. WORK:  Okay.  Well, again -- yes.  One more real quick."
     Q:  Sydney Freedberg from Breaking Defense.
"     MR. WORK:  Hi, Sydney."
"     Q:  You've mentioned the importance of the operational level of war, which is certainly crucial.  But one critique we've had -- well, from Vietnam on, but particularly with Iraq and Afghanistan -- is that we've actually fallen down -- (inaudible) -- strategic level that we've, you know, kind of like the Germans in World War II, have been really, really good at the military parts but terrible at the pol-mil parts."
     Is there a way to make sure that in our focus on multi-domain that we don't create a very effective military machine that once again has terrible strategic direction?
"     MR. WORK:  Listen, the Department of Defense focuses on conventional and strategic deterrence.  That's what we focus on.  And conventional deterrence is based on making sure our adversaries understand that we do have an advantage at both the operational and tactical level of war, and if they decide to take us on, they are most likely, and in my case I would say they are certain, to lose."
"     The decision about how you employ the military is far beyond what this panel is about.  I want them focused on one thing and one thing only; multi-domain battle, electromagnetic maneuver, operational maneuver from the sea, what is EABO --I really like that one, but I can't remember what it is -- expeditionary advanced basing operations where Marine and Army soldiers control the sea from the land.  I mean, that's what this focus is about."
     So I am going to dodge the questions --
     And say I'm looking forward to the panels.
     And thank you again.

	Now, the deputy secretary has generally two general rules as the chief operating officer of this big enterprise. One is to focus on the capabilities, the capacities and the readiness of the joint force, both now and in the future. We refer to that as the defense program. And the second thing is to make sure – or try to make sure that the enterprise operates efficiently so that every single dollar we spend or our taxpayers give us comes about, or is used in a very smart way."
"So this morning, as both Gen. Palomeros and Michele [Flournoy] told you, I want to talk about the future of the defense program, something that the department is thinking a lot about as it comes out of 13 years -- 13 straight years of war. And that is the department's innovation initiative, the Defense Innovation Initiative, and what we refer to right now as the third offset strategy, or perhaps more accurately to everyone here, offset strategies."
"
	This was announced in November by Secretary Hagel. And I know the topics of innovation, experimentation, and developing new ways of operating are a keen interest of this group and many, many others besides. Now, they're being pursued in the context of one of the most volatile security environments that we have faced in decades, perhaps as complex as any time since the end of World War II."
"So I want to briefly discuss some of the security challenges that I know you know we're facing, as well as those of our allies, and especially those of NATO, and how those challenges are informing our fiscal year 2016 budget request which we will deliver to the Congress on the 2nd of February, this coming Monday."
"And we began our fiscal year (FY) 2016 budget deliberations this past fall as the international security environment was being shaken by three really large geopolitical surprises, all of which required a robust response. First, as you know, in February and March 2014, Russia used unconventional means to destabilize, illegally occupy and annex Crimea. Russia then sponsored and encouraged separatist activity in eastern Ukraine, violating international law and Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity."
"
	Now, these actions worked to reshape the boundaries of a major European state. I think it shocked everyone, surprised everyone. It shocked everyone in Europe and the United States. And it may herald -- these are early days -- it may herald a period of prolonged and heightened tension with Russia unless Moscow is convinced to change its course."
"
	The second came in June, when ISIL, the Islamic State in Islamic Levant, now called ISIS, launched an offensive out of northeast Syria into Iraq. They quickly routed four Iraqi divisions. They captured Mosul, a large city. They overran al-Anbar province. They effectively erased the border between Syria and Iraq, and threatened Baghdad itself."
"
	Now, the threat to our people and our interests, and as an opportunity to partner with a new, more inclusive Iraqi government, compelled us, the United States and our allies and partners to forge a coalition and to use force in Iraq once again to confront this growing threat."
"Now, the third event came in August. That's when the scale and breadth of the Ebola outbreak surprised the world. The Center for Disease Control did an estimate that unless there was a major international response, as many as 1.4 million people could be infected in West Africa by this terrible virus by the turn of the year. And so in response, President Obama spearheaded an international effort to confront this threat posed by Ebola and its potential threat."
"
	Now, that was -- (inaudible) -- in August is when we start to do what is called the fall review, where we start to put together the program and the budget, which is then delivered to Congress in February. Now, fortunately, because of the assistance provided by the United States and its allies and our international partners, it now looks like the trend lines for Ebola are breaking in our favor. And it appears -- it appears right now that it's on its way to being contained, although this is going to require close monitoring -- (inaudible) -- between now, and continued international assistance."
"
	In Iraq, coalition airstrikes synchronized with our partners on the ground have steadily degraded ISIL's capabilities and helped stop their advances. They are on a defensive -- essentially a defensive posture right now, while teams of U.S. and coalition advisers have helped Iraqi and Kurdish security forces to regenerate, restructure and begin to take the fight to the enemy."
"Now, Russia poses a different challenge. It's modernizing a military that was in steep decline throughout the 1990s and the early 2000s. Its naval and air units are operating at a pace and an extent that hasn't been seen in quite some time, to include a large increase in trans-oceanic and global military operations. And as General Dempsey has said, Russia's activities in the Ukraine are, quote, ""giving the world a disturbing image of the hybrid nature of military aggression in the 21st century."""
"
	Now, a combination of sanctions and rapid and steep drop in oil prices have put Moscow under pressure and shows that there are consequences to its actions. But without question, Russia continues its aggressive behavior. So together, the United States and its NATO allies have demonstrated that we are upholding the principle that a bigger nation cannot bully a small one and we are opposing Russian aggression, supporting Ukraine's democracy, and reassuring our NATO allies."
"
	As President Obama has said, Ukraine should not be able to -- should -- excuse me -- should be able to choose its own future. And we reject any talk of a sphere of influence. And speaking in Estonia this past September, the president made it clear that our commitment to our NATO allies in the face of Russian aggression is unwavering. As he said it, in this alliance there are no old members and there are no new members. There are no junior partners and there are no senior partners. There are just allies, pure and simple. And we will defend the territorial integrity of every single ally."
"
	Now, as you know, the U.S. is working to ensure we have the right military presence in Europe. We're looking at the plans that we had. We're determining whether or not we need to change them. We're looking at increased troop rotations, more joint training, more exercises. We're working to improve NATO's ability to deploy faster in time of crisis, including enhancing NATO's rapid response force."
"And we are also improving infrastructure right now at facilities that will help receive rapid reinforcements throughout eastern Europe. We continue to help build partnership capacity, particularly in our allies in the Baltics. And in support, you will see on Monday in our budget submission there will be $800 million to continue these activities under the European Reassurance Initiative, which I think you all have heard that we announced this past fall."
"
	Now, even as we do these things, DOD, in concert with our allies, continues to closely monitor Russia and events in Eastern Europe. And we will continue to determine and constantly analyze whether or not further adjustments are needed to our presence there and our force capacities, capabilities and readiness."
"
	Now, these surprises come on top of an already volatile security environment. We are drawing down our combat operations in Afghanistan and moving over to a train, advise and assist posture. We have ongoing negotiations, hard negotiations with Iran over their pursuit of a nuclear weapon. We're dealing with China's provocative actions in the East and South China Seas. And we all live in a global cyber environment that culminated, at least in the public's eye, I think, with the hack of the Sony network this past November and December."
"So it's in this very predictable and unpredictable and volatile environment that we started our fall budget review. It's kind of early days in all three of these crises, but we needed to put together a coherent budget. So we started with one important question: Did these surprises fundamentally change the assumptions that underpinned our current defense strategy that was outlined in the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review? And we looked at the force planning construct to the degree, and we asked ourselves: Has it changed?"
"
	And the short answer that we concluded in the fall review was, no, at least not yet. We think the strategic priorities that were identified in the QDR, and there were five of them -- rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific region: two, maintaining a strong commitment to security and stability in Europe and the Middle East; three, sustaining a global counterterrorism campaign; four, strengthening key allies and partnerships; five, and prioritizing key modernization efforts."
"And we think those five priorities still are germane. But we also recognize that the assumptions that underpin them, especially those that deal about European security and what it will take to maintain peace and security in the Middle East, are going to require constant reevaluation. And so as you all know, we've dropped -- we're going to drop the budget for a fiscal year that starts in October, trying to figure out whether, you know, what's going to happen 18 months from now."
"We are already starting, God help me (Laughter), we're already starting the fiscal '17 budget review, which will conclude next February, and we will make continual adjustments as we go along."
"
	And we reached the same conclusion for the strategy's force planning construct, and that calls for a United States joint force that in peacetime does three things. One, it defends the homeland. Two, we conduct a global counterterrorism campaign in conjunction with our partners. And three, we assure our allies and deter potential adversaries in multiple regions around the world."
"
	Now, at any time, if deterrence fails, then we'll have a force that is big enough that would defeat or deny an adversary in one region in a very large multi-phased joint campaign, and have the capability to simultaneously deny an opportunistic aggressor in a second theater from reaching their objectives or imposing extreme costs on them at the same time."
"
	Now, we concluded that we were pretty good in our force structure in that regard, with one key exception, and that turned out to be intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance. For all of those of you in this business, you know you can never have enough. It's a constant guess. And no matter where you end up, you always need more. So we're probably going to be -- you'll see on Monday that we'll probably be adding more in that regard."
"But we think we can execute the 2014 strategy at manageable levels of risk, at least right now, with elevated risks in some areas -- ISR, certain things. That said, as we survey this very volatile and complex strategic landscape, we believe that the risks are increasing over time. The uncertainty of what is happening and the way these things may progress is rising."
"
	Consequently, we continue to closely scrutinize our strategy, and whether or not our force structure and our global posture and our alliances are strong enough, and is keeping pace with the unrelenting and in some cases increased demands throughout the globe."
"
	But now to what I really want to talk about, and that is it's become very clear to us that our military's long comfortable technological edge -- the United States has relied on a technological edge ever since, well even in World War II. We've relied upon it for so long, it's steadily eroding."
"
	Now, we still believe we have a margin, but the margin is steadily eroding and it's making us uncomfortable. We believe this is one of the greatest strategic challenges facing the department. And it's ultimately will -- (inaudible) -- a challenge that faces -- that impacts America's leadership around the globe."
"While the United States and our closest allies fought two lengthy wars over the past 13 years, the rest of our -- the rest of the world and our potential adversaries were seeing how we operated. They looked at our advantages. They studied them. They analyzed them. They looked for weaknesses. And then they set about devising ways to counter our technological over-match."
"
	So across the board, we see rapid developments in nuclear weapons, modernization of nuclear weapons; new anti-ship, anti-air missiles; long-range strike missiles; counter-space capabilities; cyber capabilities; electronic warfare capabilities; special operations capabilities that are operated at the lower end. All are designed to counter our traditional military strengths and our preferred way of operating."
"
	As a global military power, much of our military operates overseas, as you know. We generally fight away games in concert with allies and partners whenever possible. So our ability to project dominant military forces across the trans-oceanic distances underwrites U.S. conventional deterrence."
"And so for that reason, the 2014 QDR prioritized overcome -- trying to overcome better the constant and ever-present tyranny of distance which the United States operates with, and defeating adversaries in contested environments far from our shores."
"
	Now, we believe that our ability to project power, coupled with strong alliances and partnership overseas, has underwritten global stability and prosperity for decades, whether it be in Asia, in Europe, or the Middle East. If our ability to project power seemed to be eroded, it could strain our alliances and partnerships, resulting in a far more dangerous and unstable world, in our view."
"
	Our perceived inability to achieve a power projection over-match, or an over-match in operations, clearly undermine, we think, our ability to deter potential adversaries. And we simply cannot allow that to happen."
"Now, what gives us all pause is that the military of our potential competitors around the world have been rising since 2001. And over that period of time, spending by our allies and partners has generally, not in every case, but has generally declined. China's defense budget has double-digit growth nearly every year over the past decade. And both Russia and China are fielding very advanced capabilities at an extremely rapid pace."
"
	What's more, some of the potential competitors are letting us do the research and development, then they steal it from us through cyber theft and they go right to development, rather than spending their own resources on Research and Development (R&D)."
"
	I often describe it as they have a farm-to-market mentality, and we have this very industrial thing where we grow stuff, we put it in freezers, we transport it across long distances. By the time you get it on your table, you don't know how old it is. Sometimes it's too old; doesn't taste good. It's a bad situation. (Laughter)."
"So to maintain our warfighting edge, we're trying to address this erosion -- our perceived erosion of technological superiority with the Defense Innovation Initiative and the third offset strategy. Now, as Secretary Hagel said, this new initiative is an ambitious department-wide effort to identify and invest in innovative ways to sustain and advance America's military dominance for the 21st century."
"
	It will put new resources behind innovation and you will see that in our budget. But it also accounts for today's fiscal realities by focusing our investments that will sharpen our military edge even as we have to contend with fewer resources."
"Now, as you will see when we drop our budget on Tuesday, it seeks to reverse this decline in defense spending in the past five years. We will ask -- the president will ask for the money that he believes is required to defend the nation. And it works to address the under-investment in new technologies by making targeted investments in those areas. Specifically, if you go to the 2014 QDR, you will see a one-to-one kind of where the money is going, based on a strategic review, and particularly in research, development and procurement."
"
	Now, we make significant investments in our nuclear enterprise; new space capabilities; advanced sensors, communications and munitions for power projection in contested environments; missile defense; and cyber capabilities. We are also investing in promising new technologies, including unmanned undersea vehicles; advanced sea mines; high-speed strike weapons; advanced aeronautics; from new engines to new, different types of prototypes; electromagnetic rail guns; and high-energy lasers."
"
	But the Defense Innovation Initiative (DII) and the third offset strategy, or strategies, are much more than just technology. They're about increasing the competitive advantage of our American forces and our allies over the coming decades."
"So, I think most of you know this, but let me just quickly go through what I mean by an offset strategy. In the Cold War, the U.S. and its NATO allies sought a series of competitive advantages over the Soviet Union, a means by which to offset their very, very great conventional strength. The United States actually pursued two offset strategies. The first came with President Eisenhower's New Look Strategy in the early 1950s. When President Eisenhower came into office in 1953, the United States was heavily outnumbered by the Soviet conventional superiority on the European central front."
"Eisenhower estimated it would take 92 U.S. and NATO divisions to have any chance of checking, at the time, 175 Soviet divisions. But a force that size, with Europe rebuilding itself after the Second World War, and with the United States starting to try to balance its budget for a long-term competition with the Soviet Union, it was neither politically or economically viable."
"
	So to counter Soviet superiority without bankrupting the West, Eisenhower directed a top-level strategic review which resulted in what was called the New Look. And that said the U.S. would reduce military manpower and would rely instead on its nuclear arsenal, where we had a big advantage at the time, for deterrence. We had a very substantial lead at the time, and that technological advantage in nuclear weapons and their delivery systems provided the most effective offset to Soviet strength and their geographical advantage."
"
	Now, if you look back, it's kind of crazy when you look back and you say, ""Wow, you know, we were planning to drop so many nuclear bombs everywhere."" It was a different time. But it did provide a credible deterrence, without question. And it enabled Eisenhower to actually reduce spending from the levels that were originally projected."
"And like all -- but like all military advantages, the Soviets felt its sting and they started to do something about it. And they started to gradually build up their tactical and nuclear -- strategic nuclear forces. And so by the 1970s, we really didn't have a credible -- it was no longer a credible deterrence. The dangers of nuclear escalation were just too high."
"So in response, in the 1970s, we developed a second offset strategy. Now, the key operational challenge that we were trying to do is the Soviets were going to attack in echelon forces that came very, very deep behind what was then called the FEBA -- the forward edge of the battle area, or the forward line of troops (FLOT). You know, we have to have acronyms."
"And how do you do that without resorting to nuclear weapons? So in the summer of 1973, what would later become the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, launched a project called the Long-Range Research and Development Planning Program. And it was to provide the president and the joint force with better tools to respond to a Warsaw Pact attack."
"It recommended going after conventional weapons with near-zero miss, a very simple idea that had profound implications throughout the entire defense program. In 1977, Defense Secretary Harold Brown and his Under Secretary of Research and Engineering William Perry -- I mean, these were just great thinkers in the Cold War. They set about developing this next offset strategy and they assigned DARPA the responsibility for integrating all of these promising military technologies into a system of systems for deep attack, which they called ""assault breaker."""
"It called for aircraft with light area sensor cueing, surface-to-surface ballistic missiles that could dispense a blanket of anti-armor submunitions. And it culminated in a very successful demonstration in 1982 at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. And as it turned out, the Soviets were watching. And the implications of that single demonstration, along with all of the ferment that was going on in the joint force at the time, really caused them to pause."
"And by 1984, general -- the Soviet General Staff -- chief head of the Soviet General Staff, Marshall (inaudible), he said, ""Look, these reconnaissance strike complexes"" -- that was the Soviet word for them -- ""using very accurate terminally guided conventional munitions, would achieve the same destructive effects as tactical nuclear weapons."" They were very model-driven at that time. They cranked their models and they said, ""game over."""
"
	And we had actually picked a competitive advantage that we knew our adversary, the Soviets, could not duplicate, and therefore injected uncertainty in their minds, changing their war-fighting calculus."
"
	Now, the Assault Breaker Program was picked up by the joint force. Army and the Air Force started to talk about air-land battle. That later became follow-on forces attack with our NATO allies, and ideas like discriminate deterrence. And they saw the potential. I mean, it was truly a very energizing time."
"I was at that time a young 1st, 2nd lieutenant in the Marine Corps, a captain, then a major. And I just cannot tell you the intellectual ferment that was going on in the joint force at the time."
"Now, we continued to build that even in an era of declining budgets, starting in 1985. And we were the clear beneficiary of this. We were an aggressive first mover. We had picked an area that we knew our potential -- our most likely adversary couldn't copy. And we demonstrated in 1991 to the rest of the world, and it really had a giant impact."
"We were in the very, very early stages of what we called ""battle networks,"" but against a very early battle network with just relatively a few number of precision-guided weapons. The Iraqi heavy formations that were built on the Soviet model were virtually reduced to an array of targets and (inaudible). And they were again in 2003 during the initial invasion of Iraq war."
"
	So the second offset strategy proved decades-long enduring, just like the first did, providing the U.S. military and its allies with a decisive operational advantage that has lasted now for nearly four decades. But just as with the first offset strategy, the second offset strategy is showing its teeth. We're now starting to see the capabilities and the advantages that it accrues to us is starting to erode and at an accelerating pace."
"
	And to ensure that we maintain conventional deterrence, we're seeking a third offset strategy now that will maintain and perhaps advance the competitive advantage of America and its military allies."
"Now, this effort is not a department -- a departure from the current strategy in 2014 in any way. It's completely in line with its emphasis on innovation. It's about developing the means to offset advantages or advances in anti-access area denial weapons and other advanced technologies that we see proliferating around the world."
"
	Now, the execution of a successful defense strategy is ultimately about balancing ways and means, as this audience know. And it's primarily about changing our ways and means right now and the operational concepts we use to achieve our objectives."
"Now, there's three things, though, I want to make a difference. There's going to be three key differences between what is happening in this offset strategy and the earlier ones. First, it's going to have a much more trying temporal component. In 1975 and in the 1950s, we knew our adversary and we said, ""We can pick something where we will have an enduring advantage."" We don't think we're in that type of environment right now."
"So, we'll be looking for promising technologies that we can do in what we call the FYDP, the future years defense program, generally about five years out. We'll identify long-range advances that we can pull up and hopefully field in the '20s, and then we'll plant the seeds for R&D, which will give us an advantage for the '30s."
"
	So we're actually thinking of this in terms of a never-ending -- we're constantly updating this strategy, rather than trying to pick the one single unitary field theory that's going to make that work."
"
	Second, we don't face a single monolithic or implacable adversary like we did in the Cold War. We face multiple potential competitors, from small regional states like North Korea and Iran, to large advanced states like Russia and China, to non-state adversaries and actors with advanced capabilities."
"
	Each of these are probably going to require a different approach and a different strategy, which is why we actually say ""offset strategies."" As applied to Europe, for example, we're probably going to have to have a high technology component as well as an innovative whole-of-government concept to counter the ambiguous hybrid threats we saw in Crimea and we continue to see in Ukraine today."
"And the third big difference is that in the 1950s and the 1970s, generally these advances were military capabilities that were brought along by military labs. But now with robotics, autonomous operating guidance and control systems, visualization, biotechnology, miniaturization, advanced computing and big data, and additive manufacturing like 3D printing, all those are being driven by the commercial sector."
"And what makes it harder for us now is in 1975 when you go back and look at the Long-Range Research and Development Planning Program (LRRDPP) at that point, people from industry were actually leading the panels. We can't do that anymore because it would give some type of unfair advantage to people that we'd bring in. We must really capture the commercial sector and we're trying to work our way through this right now."
"
	When you consider these three different competitive environments, this is really like the inter-war period. There was all sorts of technology things going on. There was advances in radar and sonar sensors. There were advances in aviation. There were advances in maritime capabilities, submarines. There was mechanizations. There were radios."
"
	It was the people who could pick and choose and put them together in an innovative operation concept that gave them an advantage. And that's what we have to do today. We're not going to be able to pick out one specific strategy that will be good for all potential adversaries and all potential capabilities. It has to be much more, much more innovative and agile."
"
	So there's no silver bullet solutions and we have to put it into -- we have to kind of use war-gaming and operational concept development and discussions with our allies and discussions with our commercial partners to try to figure out our way through this."
"And I would just like to end that what was so critical about the initial, or the second offset strategy, and the first when you look at the dual-capable aircraft that we have throughout the alliance right now, was the importance of our NATO allies and our partnerships. In '75, we actually formed what was called the European-American Workshop, a very innocuous name, but it was focused on trying to figure out together how this offset strategy would work."
"
	And so we need to work again with our allies, and we intend to do so. I recently discussed this undertaking in a meeting with my British counterpart. We're going to do other with NATO, as well as our allies in Asia, around the world because there might be different approaches in both regions."
"
	So we face similar challenges in challenges of power projection and military operations. And while deterrence and defense of our allied territory have naturally -- taken focus right now, as Gen. Palomeros said, we have to look to the future and see how can we do better."
"
	I think the U.S. and its allies have a long history of adapting to change and identifying new approaches that pit our enduring strengths against the vulnerabilities of our adversaries. And it has been absolutely vital to work with our allies."
"
	Just a couple of points. I know I'm running a little long here."
"
	First, the critical importance of interdependence with our allies. That's, as I said. The department is trying to deepen our cooperation with our close allies and partners. We're collaborating -- collaboratively planning now on our roles, missions and investments in future capabilities."
"
	It's important that we look at this as an alliance. Each of our alliance members have certain key advantage or certain key things that they really, really are good at. We don't need a lot of duplication, especially at the depressed defense levels that we have now."
"
	So if we approach this as an alliance and figure out where the technological advantages lie or who is the leader in certain areas, be it undersea technology or mine warfare or advanced missiles, we need to try to work together. We need to try to come up with operational concepts, just like we did with follow-on forces attack, which address problems as an alliance."
"
	So, said another way, we need to be thinking as an alliance about the potential advantage in specialization. Beyond that, many or all of our allies have forces that are capable of absorbing certain types of these capabilities and some now. We shouldn't try to make a cookie-cutter solution just like there will be no cookie-cutter potential adversary."
"
	And we all must recognize that a fear of the technology gap within the alliance is closely related to a growing resource gap. All of us together need to decide this innovation effort is a priority or not; that is, a deliberate effort. And we just can't float along at the resource levels that the alliance is giving to defense right now."
The imperative to meet the challenges I have outlined is part of the reason why allied policymakers and parliaments said in Wales last September that they really needed to get all of the NATO partners to the 2 percent level of national output to defense. And we hope that that is going to be the case.
"
	Now, our NATO allies and NATO itself, they all have existing processes and institutions that focus on these cutting-edge technologies and new concepts. We see it all the time. So, to Gen. Palomeros, let me just say that we look for this effort in NATO -- we look to the leadership of the allied command transformation and its elements like the Joint Warfare Center and the Lessons Learned Center."
"
	We have to embrace, not shy away, from criticism. Those are going to come. I deal with that every day inside the department. We'll surely regret it if in the future, we look back and say we didn't go far enough in this period. So I encourage all of our allies and all of the joint force to be very bold and really push the boundaries of innovation."
"
	You probably all -- many of you have heard me say this -- say, you know, what keeps -- how do you sleep at night? And I say, ""I sleep great; I sleep like a baby; I wake up crying every two hours."" (Laughter.)"
"
	This is a time, though, when great things can happen. Generally, when you have resources that are constrained, if you look in the past, that has actually stimulated thought. There's an awful lot of thought going on right now. We are constantly being moved away from a focus on the future because of the problems of the day. But if we can strike a good balance between the two, then I know in the future the United States military and its allies will continue to have a technological over-match against potential adversaries whenever or wherever we encounter them."
"
	I look forward to your questions."
"
	(Applause.)"
"
	MICHELE FLOURNOY: Deputy Secretary Work, thank you so much for a really tremendous exposition of the offset strategy and what it might mean for our trans-Atlantic alliance. You've put a lot of issues on the table."
"
	I'm going to start the discussion with a few questions, and then we'll open it up to the audience."
"
	I want to just start by trying to draw both of you out on the question of what is the problem we're trying to solve. I think one of the risks in the offset strategy -- I think we -- the same thing has happened with transformation, where the term can mean all things to all people. And everything becomes transformational or everything becomes part of the offset strategy."
"
	So I think it -- it makes sense to start thinking in the trans-Atlantic context what are the specific areas of advantage that we're trying to offset. What are the particular challenges, whether it's in power projection or hybrid warfare or regular warfare that for a trans-Atlantic -- the trans-Atlantic community really needs to be the focus areas as we think about offsets?"
"
	Do you want to -- do you want to start with that, general?"
"
	GENERAL JEAN-PAUL PALOMEROS: From the NATO perspective, really we have to keep the -- (inaudible) -- whatever force multipliers we have today focusing obviously on our big -- (inaudible) -- which are the command and control, the information sharing, intelligence -- (inaudible) -- reconnaissance."
"
	I mean, the core of the permanent mission of the alliance, which makes the glue that the -- (inaudible). That's where I would put -- (inaudible) -- the highest priority."
"
	And then -- and very much in line with what you stressed, I think leadership, training, education and exercises. This is how we will develop new concepts. We cannot -- (inaudible) -- because the world is so demanding and so complex, as you clearly stated, from scratch new concepts or new doctrines. We really have to fashion -- to shape that in accordance on the one hand with what we perceive; and on the other hand with the skills that we have."
"
	And we have -- we are fortunate to have those great leaders. We have young people really motivated. There are still integrating new technology in their own (inaudible) and in their own approach. And they have such tremendous operational experience today that we have to capitalize."
"
	So if we make -- match both, I think we are able to face those challenges. But we have to make priorities. The good news is that when the head of states met in Wales, they set up -- we set up for them and they accepted a list of many shortfalls – (inaudible) shortfalls. Then we have -- we have our road map for the future, how we will address those shortfalls."
"
	And the answer is innovating and seeing how we can match the concept -- (inaudible) -- people, and some breakthrough technologies which we have still to work in NATO."
"
	But -- and to conclude, in NATO, we have this wonderful tool which is the science and technology. This is a wonderful network of very skilled scientists, very much focused on operational effects. And we have not tapped as much as should on this -- on that potential."
"
	So there is still an innovative potential in NATO. And I will call for a new innovative strategy in NATO. This is what we need."
"
	MR. WORK: Well, a lot will depend upon the future actions of Russia. As Gen. Palomeros said, NATO has both challenges in the east right now, as well as challenges to the south. That's why I tried to emphasize that we are not seeking a single strategy that is a cookie-cutter strategy for all of these different capabilities."
"
	This offset strategy that we pursue in the Pacific is focused primarily on overcoming anti-access and area of denial network. Whereas in Europe, it might be something different."
"
	I would actually say also that this is not all about technology. I can't say this enough. First of all, the great strength of the United States and its NATO allies are the capabilities of its servicemen and -women and their ability to adapt to a wide variety of different situations."
"
	So, leadership development is a key aspect of the Defense Innovation Initiative. And I would suggest that what we're trying to do in the Middle East is an offset strategy, too. We're trying instead of us using large ground forces, trying to address those problem in different innovative ways."
"
	So, it is more of a broad-based continual review of what we have in the portfolio of capabilities that would provide us over-matches in different capabilities be it in different areas, be it in an operational concept or a new technology or new ways of approaching a problem."
"
	MS. FLOURNOY: So the specific question is how you both think about structuring collaboration between the United States and its NATO allies in this area. Because we tend to think about primarily the benefits to NATO of the U.S. sharing its thinking, sharing its -- its progress in these areas on innovation and so forth."
"
	But there's also tremendous importance to the United States that at the end of the day, we're not standing there all alone with beautiful technologies that keep our edge, but no more interoperability, no allies that can really join with us when we go to war or dealing with a conflict."
"
	So I think there's interest on both sides to making that collaboration work. What are your initial thoughts on how that should be structured?"
"
	General, and then Mr. Secretary?"
"GEN. PALOMEROS: Well first and foremost, the presence of what was defined as the allied command transformation 10 years ago, 11 years ago -- (inaudible) -- very far-thinking people -- (inaudible) -- was not easy certainly to set up -- (inaudible) organization looking to the future, adapting for -- adapting the alliance."
"
	So we must take the full benefits, and we are really striving through these kind of meetings and the seminars. But not only that, we have a lot of different experimentations. We are working through exercise, concept development. We are innovating in exercise. We are putting more emphasis in the interaction with industry as well."
"
	So we are very much not only driven by the U.S. strategy, but we are inspired by the U.S. strategy. And -- but most importantly, we must keep, if I may say, -- (inaudible) -- the U.S. on board with NATO. I mean, and this is really our objective. So it's through the different initiatives that we have -- we have this -- connected -- forces initiative to reinvigorate exercise, training and education."
"
	We dramatically need, and this is the case -- (inaudible) -- dramatically need the U.S. fully involved and not only to lead, but to provide us with this kind of incentive to move forward and to keep the -- the -- (inaudible) -- interoperability. But what I see today is indisputably a firm and a permanent commitment of our U.S. ally within NATO. There -- shouldn't be any doubt about that."
"
	We must get the best out of that. We must be able perhaps to -- (inaudible -- a little bit of -- (inaudible) -- objective into the U.S. activities to make sure that we can -- (inaudible) -- through concept development, experiment and exercises, to make sure that on the one hand we have not a -- (inaudible) -- organization process, which is -- (fine ?) -- and which is very robust. But on the other hand, -- (inaudible) -- organization processes overturned by the -- (inaudible) -- in a certain way."
"
	And then in a certain way, the U.S. -- (inaudible) -- drifting apart from their commitment to interoperability. This is very practical, but we need to -- check -- that -- (inaudible) -- on a permanent basis."
"MR. WORK: The Allied Command transformation does provide us with a platform we didn't have in the mid-'80s. So, we anticipate, again, the secretary of defense just announced this initiative in November. And as you know, we're going through a leadership transition in the department. Dr. Carter's confirmation hearing we believe is on the 4th. And he should -- (inaudible) -- be, you know, confirmed in February."
"
	And so we want to bring on -- we want to get obviously Dr. Carter's views on this. There are meetings that are NATO -- (inaudible) -- coming up this March."
"
	But I do want to pick up something that Gen. Palomeros said. Demonstrations were very important in the Cold War -- the Reforger exercises, the -- Nifty Nugget exercises, different exercises where we actually worked together as an alliance to demonstrate the capabilities."
"
	And I believe one of the things that we will be able to do in the future, you will see, are more demonstrations. And by having demonstrations with our allies, we'll be able to test out different operational concepts on different problems, with different technologies and with different leadership approaches. And so I would expect that to be a very, very important part of how we bring our allies together."
"
	MS. FLOURNOY: General, how worried are you about the -- our European allies being able to really maintain the focus on resources -- focus along the lines of what you're describing on innovation and transformation? You know, we -- at Wales, we saw the readiness action plan put into place, which was more a near-term focus on -- (inaudible) -- assurance. And even already, we've seen some countries really struggling to meet the resources commitments there."
"
	Now, we're asking them at the same time to also perhaps increase their investment in more long-term transformational activities -- their part of a new offset strategy. How worried are you about the resourcing side, about the risk of becoming sort of a two-tier alliance in terms of capabilities and commitments?"
"
	GEN. PALOMEROS: Well, this is a permanent concern, and this is not by chance that we are here discussing that, because this is exactly what we need. We need a, as you say, a renaissance or something like that in innovation in Europe. We have the same trends that -- (inaudible) -- in the U.S. and that was -- (inaudible) -- by the way the -- (inaudible) -- last European Council, which was the first dedicated on defense, which is perhaps good news."
"So, we have to influence that the best, and I think NATO is really a good organization to do that. I mean, we share 22 nations in common between NATO and the European Union. So and when the head of states and the government meet, they are -- are the same people with the same security concerns, the same objectives."
"
	So, on the other hand, there are tremendous innovative strengths in Europe as well. We see that through middle-size enterprise companies. I will certainly advocate for more trans-Atlantic -- (inaudible) -- for innovation, industry, research and technology. This is, in my perspective, the strategy -- (inaudible) -- conduct, if I may say so, at least for -- as far as NATO is concerned."
"
	This is the strategy -- (inaudible) -- that we have to develop. And this is why this -- this initiative is so important, in my perspective. And that we have to advocate in Europe not to a mirror of that exactly, but to take the strengths of the many innovative companies and research and technology which are really able to bring to NATO something different."
"
	And I'm sure that from what you say, that the U.S. will be interested in these trends, in this innovation, because we have some small countries, but they are no small countries in NATO. We have a lot of good brains, a lot of people able to matching new solution to the questions that we have today, because they are facing the problem. They are at the border of the problems, so they have no alternative but to face the reality."
"
	And then there are -- (inaudible) -- for instance, and I will close with that, we are organizing a network of Center of Excellence, which are -- (inaudible) -- by NATO. This is a wonderful potential because every single nation is putting its best in that, and there are a lot of good brains thinking about concepts on the one hand, so -- and if we are able to network -- (inaudible) -- all these -- (inaudible) -- we will put a kind of gathering of intelligence which will not be matched by any other type of -- innovation."
"MR. WORK: I'd just like to pick up. This is really about a balance of resources. And the United States military since FY 2012, through FY 2015, last year's budget submission, we took $790 billion out of our projected future years defense spending, which is what we use to build a balanced program with capabilities, capacities and current readiness to meet the demands of today, and future readiness, which is getting ready for these challenges."
"And as we signaled last year, if we go to sequestration, that makes achieving this balance extremely difficult. And that is why I think all of our allies committing to saying they would get to 2 percent of GDP in NATO, and for us avoiding sequestration is extremely important so that we would have the ability to pursue innovative things that would make our future readiness better."
"
	MS. FLOURNOY: I'd like to open up the questions to the audience. If I call on you, please state your name and ask a question."
"
	Yes, ma'am, right here. They will bring -- the microphone is coming."
"
	Q: Hi. It's (inaudible)."
"
	Bob, you talked a little bit about the Sony hack. And that brings up a very interesting problem with Internet security and cybersecurity, which is a big issue if we want to keep technological superiority. When we talk about sharing things and sharing technologies, and everybody with a cell phone and a social media account seems to be spreading every secret that there is, how are we going to address the problems of keeping a technological edge in this era of, you know, everything goes out everywhere?"
"
	And in -- when your SmartWatch is going to talk to your stove, and everybody with an account is going to post everything -- everywhere, and everything shows up on Twitter, how do we address the allies and the interoperability and trying to keep that technological edge, when -- when we can't keep hardly anything secret anymore?"
"MR. WORK: When people look at the defense budget, they look for big things -- aircraft carriers, long-range bombers. I will tell you, one of the biggest advances in the PB 16 budget is our going after what are called joint regional security stack (JRSS). Now, what does that mean? Right now, the Department of Defense has over 1,000 firewalls that it has to defend on a daily basis."
"Just basic (inaudible), people, you know, giving their code password to someone or doing something, that is an impossible problem. Through the JRSS, a relatively small, modest amount -- we fully funded it -- we will drop to 50 defendable firewalls by FY17. That will make us far more defendable as a network."
We continue to work -- Frank Kendall is working through Better Buying Power 3.0 to put cybersecurity standards inside of our contracts so that we would hold people who work with us accountable for being able to protect their information.
"
	Your point, (inaudible), is exactly right. This is a problem we have. It is a problem I'm certain for the alliance and all of our partners. We're getting after it as fast as we can, but the number of networks that we have is just astounding. And getting those streamlined is going to be the real key to having a dependable network."
"
	MS. FLOURNOY: Yes, in the way back? Sorry."
"
	Standing up over here in the corner?"
"
	Q: Thank you. (inaudible) -- question on Russia -- (inaudible) -- briefly."
"
	NATO officials' communication -- military-to-military communications has been suspended with Russia. Some of the partner countries still maintain military-to-military discussions, but the first question: What are the prospects of restoring those communications?"
"
	And then the second question is on the Black Sea region, what -- what the assessment is of the Black Sea region. There have been some reports from the alliance about possible movement of nuclear weapons and -- (inaudible) -- into Crimea. So, just your assessment -- (inaudible)."
"
	GEN. PALOMEROS: Well, first and foremost, this is not -- (inaudible) -- my responsibility, and my colleague, General Breedlove -- (inaudible). But nevertheless, what I can say that -- (inaudible) -- must avoid is any risk of a miscalculation. And we know that this risk is coming higher and higher the more you have an activity close to the borders of NATO."
"
	And in the alliance, we are really focusing on ensuring our allies of NATO presence and NATO will to do its job as far as protecting freedom, collective security and collective defense. We do that in a very defensive and very visible manner. We are organizing -- (inaudible) -- which are known and -- (inaudible) -- and -- (inaudible) -- those objectives."
"
	We are predictable. And what we ask from -- (inaudible) -- counterparts is to see the same -- (inaudible). And that's why I think it is important to try to restore -- to keep the minimum link to avoid -- (inaudible) -- any misunderstanding or any miscalculation which could have a dramatic effect."
"
	And -- (inaudible) -- on the other hand, a part of our mission -- (inaudible) -- permanent assessment of the strategy -- (inaudible), we are closely monitoring what is happening and the changing in the strategy -- (inaudible) -- with new weapons system, what I call some game-changers, which could deny -- (inaudible) -- access to some strategic part of the alliance or ability to deploy our forces where and when it is needed."
"
	So, and this is a crucial part of day-to-day assessments, and are looking in the future for how to transform the alliance to keep the edge, as we discussed, of those very strategic domains."
"
	MR. WORK: We continue to interact with Russia on a daily basis. We talk with them about the INF Treaty, the Intermediate Nuclear Force Treaty. We talk -- we have cooperation in space. They are cooperating and they are working with us as we work with Iran."
"
	But we have clearly said their actions in Ukraine and Crimea are unacceptable, and we have worked with our NATO allies and our European Union allies to establish relatively tough sanctions. And the president has made clear as far as allies go, Ukraine is not a NATO ally, obviously, but allies -- we will defend every NATO ally and we will pursue other means such as sanctions, et cetera, with what Russia is trying to do in Ukraine."
"
	This is something that's being discussed constantly. It depends upon Russian actions and it is something that continues to evolve from day to day and week to week, depending on how Russia reacts."
"
	MS. FLOURNOY: We have time for one last question."
"
	(inaudible) -- right here -- (inaudible) -- in the front. Why don't you stand up so -- (inaudible)."
"Q: (inaudible) -- I would like to ask, General, you primarily, about the readiness action plan and your evaluation of it. This was I think a major success coming out of the Wales summit. And a lot has been done to implement it. But it really is focused on deterring Russia from taking the kinds of actions that it took in Crimea and Ukraine, that scale. It focuses on small trip-wires, rapid deployment of a fairly small force of 6,000, and pre-positioning."
"
	And so if the challenge is deterring the Russians from doing what they did in Ukraine, this kind of approach makes sense. The question is: Is it adequate to deter a larger Russian action, should they be dumb enough to do that? I think about -- (inaudible) -- and mobilizing from that. There you're dealing with tens of thousands of troops, right?"
"
	What would we have to do to adjust the readiness action plan to deal with that kind of threat?"
"
	GEN. PALOMEROS: Well, -- (inaudible) -- for the question, because it -- (inaudible) -- opportunity to -- (inaudible) -- a global perspective -- (inaudible) -- what is and what should be, and what -- (inaudible)."
"
	First and foremost, I remember two years ago -- (inaudible) -- I stated that -- (inaudible) -- two main goals of the alliance. And what we are facing is the reality -- (inaudible) -- with what we saw -- (inaudible) -- what we had to take -- (inaudible) -- is the reality that through the reduction in defense -- the injuring reduction -- (inaudible), the alliance and many allied countries have lost part of their readiness. This is not news."
"
	(inaudible) -- and if you listen to the chief of defense, the ministers, it's very clear. So putting readiness at a higher -- the highest in the action there of the Wales summit was part of our -- (inaudible). And we achieved that."
"
	So the -- (inaudible) -- in a nutshell is much, much bigger than -- (inaudible) -- one major risk. This is really a commitment to reinvest in whatever -- (inaudible) -- to build or to rebuild the proper readiness that NATO needs to face the many challenges, the many risks that we have in the north and the east and the south."
"
	So, and this is a long-term commitment. This is a new approach to -- (inaudible). Well, we are not able to predict precisely where and when it will happen, so we must be ready. We must reinvest in training. We must reinvigorate our exercises, and that's exactly what we do under, by the way, our responsibilities."
"
	And we must as well reinvest in those capabilities which will procure us the readiness we have lost -- (inaudible) -- how to, I would say, regenerate the forces, how to reposition our forces mobilities. It's very -- (inaudible) -- and that's why we need to reinvest certain -- (inaudible) -- and we will do that in concurrence with the U.S. and the European Initiative, which is absolutely crucial to rebuild this readiness."
"
	So we must see that in the context and in the perspective if we want really to imagine what is the scope of the readiness action plan. The readiness action plan is here for a long time, so we have really to capitalize on it. The very high joint readiness task force is part of it. It is only part of it. The overall objective is really to regain the readiness of the alliance."
"
	MR. WORK: These readiness action plans are very, very important. We're working closely with our NATO allies on it. But really, this is going to come down to a lot of balance and resources. And as I said, it's very difficult to make a balance between the capacities that you need to respond to Ebola, to ISIL, to Russian actions in Ukraine. It's very hard to have the capacity to respond to that with the proper capabilities and with a balance of current readiness and future readiness at the levels of the budget that would come about if sequestration comes in."
"Our -- the sequestration cuts remain in effect in FY, fiscal year 2016 and beyond. So, both for the United States and our NATO allies, we -- this is a very volatile time. It is extremely volatile, very unpredictable. And the margin of risk or the margin of superiority and the number of risks in our view are multiplying. We will make that case on Monday when we drop the budget and we hope to work with our NATO allies to make sure that the resources will give us the ability to handle both current problems, as well as deal with future problems through offset strategies."
"
	MS. FLOURNOY: Well, I think for many of us, this has been a very thought provoking discussion."
"
	General, I'm particularly grateful that you would be here in person and for the partnership that CNAS and (inaudible) have had in hosting this conversation, and hopefully continuing the trans-Atlantic conversation."
"
	And Deputy Secretary Work, we are so grateful to have you back. And so grateful that you've been willing to offer your perspectives and really set the table for what will be ongoing work on our part to support the development of the offset strategy, but also to continue the trans-Atlantic conversation."
"
	So, please join me in thanking our speakers."

"Thanks, Mark. And, to the panelists, I heard the first two-thirds of that, or so, and just wanted to commend you all the ways you're thinking about the future, the ways that we're trying to think about the future as well including the FireEye question. Maybe I'll come back to that one a little bit later. Very much concerned about vulnerability in the long haul."
"I second Penny's thought, of just a moment ago, and Jim, you started with it, but that relationship, that's the theme of today's meeting, in essence. The earlier, and more out in front of things we all get, the better we have. It may not be 100 proof, probability of 1, but we have a much higher probability of solving problems if we start early and do it together."
"I'm all in. We're trying to do that in my own world, but it's a bigger world, and Penny, I fit in."
"Mark, thanks. Mark's an old friend and colleague. I'm pleased that the nation's benefits from him, that the President benefits from him taking this job."
"This is my fourth visit to Silicon Valley as Secretary of Defense. I only note that because when I became Secretary of Defense I learned that no Secretary of Defense had been here in 20 years. So, I've been here four times this year. I think that's appropriate, and my purpose is exactly the purpose for which NSTAC was created -- more about that in a moment, which is to build and rebuild the bridges between our national security endeavor. In my case, in the Pentagon."
"My friends and colleagues here, the country's real lucky to have these two, by the way, doing what they're doing. I say that not only as a friend, but just the sheer competence there."
"For me, it's the Pentagon, and bridges between that that our national security mission, and the wonderful, open immensely creative innovative technology community, which is one of our other -- our countries other great strengths. It's been bringing those two great strengths together, which has protected us and helped us make a better world."
"This is an interesting body for me to address, and I'll tell you the reason. I worked for Casper Weinberger way back, early in my career on nuclear command and control. Some issues at that time. That happened, my time, doing that happened to coincide with the issue of the break-up of the Bell system, for those of you who can remember that. I certainly remember it."
"One system, Universal Service. It was Caps view that this was a risk to the national command and control system which was carried on the backs, in those days, of the public switch network. There were just a very few common carriers, they were all heavily regulated, and things like putting classified switches in a Faraday Cage, and grounding ductwork that carried cables and so-forth was paid off the rate base, and that was an important subsidy to national security."
"With the breakup of the Bell system, that issue became urgent, and when the dust settled -- and there was dust then too in the air, but the dust was settled through dialogue, through working together. Solutions were worked out, and NSTAC was the mechanism for doing that."
"If I remember it -- I remember it very vividly, and I'm glad. Now, it's moved on."
"It's moved on technologically, and you do a lot more than the public switch circuit switched voice telephony system of those days. But, it was President Reagan, actually, at the time that brought these two communities together to solve a problem that was urgent at the time. I just thought I'd note that because that was three decades ago, but it signifies the importance of this kind of mechanism, and as the world changed -- as I indicated, NSTAC has changed too to its great credit."
"It moved from DOD to the Department of Homeland Security. It moved from voice telephony to the Internet, and everything else that goes on it, and with it. And, I think it has more of a focus now on emerging technology, and the future, and being anticipatory. It was a little more reactive at that time. All of those good, all of those good, appropriate migrations."
"I wanted to talk a little bit about our approaches in the Department of Defense to innovation generally. And, the private-public cooperation as an instance of that, but we're trying to do a lot more than that even as the companies you invest in, and the world represented by the companies here try to do a lot of things all at the same time."
"When I began my career in physics, most technology of consequence originated in America, and it originated in one way or another in close connection to the government, frequently the national security community. We're still a big sponsor in DOD, but the technology base is much more commercial, much more global now than it was then. We need to take that into account in how we can port ourselves as the national security community."
"We also have a very different security world than we had then. We were really focused on one thing primarily, today we have -- the way I say it is, five major immediate and evolving challenges that our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines are involved with every day. They're working with a global coalition each and every day with more, and more ingenuity, and more, and more power every day to accelerate the defeat of ISIL, which we will do. We will surely do, but we want to do that as soon as possible."
"They're training with our NATO allies in Europe to deter Russian aggression. They're sailing the waters of the Asia-Pacific ensuring that the most consequential reason for America's future remains stable, secure, and prosperous for all nations. They're standing guard on the Korean peninsula day and night, every day, every night. And, countering Iran's malign influence against our friends and allies in the Middle East. All the while they're helping protect the homeland."
"In the Department of Defense, we don't have the luxury of choosing among these five challenges, or between acting in the present, or investing in the future. We have to do it all. To stay ahead of those challenges, to stay the best, I have been pushing those in the Pentagon to think, as I say, outside of our five-sided box. Invest aggressively in innovation, innovative people, innovative technologies, and innovative practices, and I want to tell you some of the things that we're doing so that you'll know but you can help us, and give us yet more ideas."
"We start with the people because they, more than anything else, are the reason why our military is the finest fighting force the world has ever known. Our people. and, that's why it's so important to do what I call building the force of the future to ensure that amidst changes in generations, in technology, and in labor markets, we're always postured to recruit, develop and retain the best young men and women that America has to offer for what it, after all, an all-volunteer force."
"Part of that, we're creating various -- I call them on-ramps and off-ramps for technical talent to flow between the DOD and the tech sector in both directions. That way more of America's brightest minds can contribute to our mission, and our outstanding military and civilian leaders, and technologists across the DOD, and the innovative defense industry that supports us already, we'll be able to interact in new ways with our countries hubs of innovation."
"Take, for example, our new defense, Digital Service, which brings in technologists from larger companies like Amazon, startups like Shopify, for a tour of duty, as we call it. These are really talented people, and we've got a bunch of them now, who come into DOD just to just a year or two. Sometimes just a project, but make a lasting contribution to us, and our mission, one they'll never forget. They can tell their kids about it when they have kids. And, also experience being part of something bigger than themselves. That's just one example."
"We have a career intermission program which lets people take a sabbatical from military service while they're getting a degree, or learning a new skill. We're bringing in entrepreneurs and residents to work with senior leaders like me on challenging problems for, again, a short time."
"We're going to hire a Chief Recruiting Officer to bring in top for stints in civilian leadership roles, not unlike HP co-founder, David Packard, who served as Deputy Secretary of Defense and was one of the first people I was associated with in this business of defense."
"One area that's particularly important here is our cyber mission force. These are of necessity very talented people. Some active duty, but also reservists and guardsmen who hunt down intruders in our networks, perform the forensic that help keep our system secure and combat our adversaries in the cyber domain. We need to be able to bring in the best talent we can and that's why we're using these folks who in many cases serve us on the weekends, and during the week are network defenders in some of our leading companies. How else are we going to have access to that kind of talent, except through the reserve and guards? It's an amazing opportunity for us."
"We also have an accept service civilian personnel system that is going to allow us to augment these forces. That way if security, cyber security experts in the private sector, or even elsewhere in DOD want to come to work at Cyber Command, the hiring process will be more competitive with the private sector, and we'll have a lot less red tape. That's going to be necessary to have some good people."
"In addition to people, which is critical, but we're also investing in technology itself. All the ones the three of you named, were involved in every single one of them, pushing the envelope as much as we can."
"The budget I've Been defending before Congress for the last few weeks, we're proposing spending nearly $72 billion dollars next year on research and development. For context, that's more than double what Intel, Apple, and Google combined spent last year. So, it's a lot of money."
"Among other things, that money funds groundbreaking work happening in the service, and DARPA, and our dozens of DOD labs, and engineering centers across the country. A wide range of technologies -- undersea systems, electronic warfare, big data analytics, energy and propulsion, robotics, A.I., advanced sensing and computing, the whole gamut."
"These funds also support our nationwide network of public-private manufacturing innovation institutes, which are an interesting thing. We're working with companies, university research labs, to fund technologies like 3D -- actually create ecosystems surrounding technology core. 3D printing, advanced materials, integrated photonics and digital manufacturing and design are some we've done already. We announced the newest one last month in Boston, I did, focused on revolutionary textiles that combine fibers with electronics to create fabrics that can sense, communicate, store energy, monitor health, change color, much more."
"Another we announced last fall, I did right here in the Valley actually, that aims -- last year, was focused, and is focused on flexible hybrid electronics which would make it possible to seriously print lightweight flexible structural integrity sensors right onto ships bridges, cars, and aircraft."
"Meanwhile, we're also investing to make DOD a leader in cyber security. The Department of Defense has three missions in cyberspace, and defending our networks, and weapons systems is job one. It's my highest priority to Mike Rogers. That's job one for you."
"Our second mission is to help our partners across the government defend the nation against cyber-attacks. We're a part of that. And, we try to help the best we can."
"The third mission, which we do ourselves, is to provide offensive cyber options that can be used in conflict as we're doing now in ISIL -- against ISIL in Iraq and Syria. We will isolate, and blackout, disrupt, fool, their networks there even as we attack them from the air, and the ground, and everywhere else we go until we've destroyed them."
"Our latest defense budget, we're investing more in all of these missions. Our total for cyber in the next five years, $35 billion for innovation in cyber. A great deal of that to also support the modernization of DOD's hundreds of networks. Terry's here, that's his responsibility."
"We're continuing to push forward new breakthroughs in cyber technology, like adaptive network defenses that swiftly adapt to threats, self-patch in real-time, self-diagnose, do forensics, and so forth."
"Now, innovation in people and technology are necessary, but they're not sufficient. We have to have innovative processes too, and let me close on that. The world we live in demands it. While the Cold War arms race was characterized by strength, with having more, bigger and better weapons, today's era of technological competition in our field is characterized by the additional variables of speed and agility such that leading the race now depends on who can out-innovate everyone else. It's no longer just a matter what we buy, it is a matter, therefore, of how we buy things. How quickly we buy them, whom we buy them from, and how quickly and creatively we're able to use them in different and innovative ways to stay ahead of future threats."
"This is a particular focus of the Strategic Capabilities Office, an organization I created back when I was Deputy Secretary of Defense in 2012, whose job was to reimagine systems that were already in our inventory because we have tens, probably a couple hundred trillion dollars of installed base in our aircraft fleets, ship fleets, vehicles of all kinds."
"His job, a guy whom I got to do that, a young guy, is to reimagine existing systems in our inventory, giving them new roles and game changing capabilities. One example that -- give you a lot of them, examples. One is the arsenal plane which takes one our oldest aircraft platforms and turns it into a flying launchpad for precision conventional weapons of all kinds. Any ship, air-to-surface, air-to-air, and so forth."
"Another innovative practice we're pursuing, this one is thanks to the Defense Digital Service who helped us do this, by the way, is inviting vetted hackers to test out cyber security under a pilot program we are calling, ""Hack the Pentagon""."
"You probably heard about in the press. This is similar to the bug bounties that lots of leading tech companies have. It's the first one ever in the federal government. It's ongoing, as we speak, but it's already exceeded all our expectations. Over 1,400 hackers registered discovery, and so far, more than 80 vulnerabilities that qualify for the bounty so far. All of this helping us to be more secure at a fraction of the cost that exhaustively diagnosing ourselves would take."
"We believe this approach effectively crowdsourcing cybersecurity has great potential for us, as it does for a number of you around the table."
"To stay innovative going forward, DOD has to continue to be open to new ideas, and new partnerships. That's why we embarked on initiatives like our start-up here in the Valley. I did it shortly after I became Secretary of Defense, the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental, DIUx, over at Moffett Field. I was there this morning to announce that we're (integrating?), we're taking this effort to the next level. I call it DIUx 2.0, nothing original about that, but it does signify that we learn, adjust, restart things. So, we're doing a, kind of, new release of that to reflect in part what we've learned over the last year."
"We're going to have a second such office. This one in Boston. A little bit different center of gravity, technically, there. A little bit more bio-tech and engineering, although everybody has everything."
"The new DIUx, or widen DIUx is going to have more processing power, we're going to have more money behind it. More money of all kinds. Faster money."
"We have a new leadership structure, a new partnership-based leadership. Again, trying to flatten ourselves, which we think would be more effective, underneath Raj Shah. I think Raj Shah is here. Raj, are you here? National Guardsman, F-16 pilot -- there he is. Combat veteran, co-founder and CEO of a successful technology start-up, everything you want in somebody who can see both sides of the equation."
"I hope you'll get a chance to meet with him and his team in the future. And, we're going to keep integrating together, keep learning from each other."
"That's one reason why I created a Defense Innovation Board, also, which I'm very pleased that Alphabet's Eric Schmidt agreed to Chair. He's doing a great job of putting together the rest of the board. We're going to have our first working session next week, so stay tuned for who else will be joining that board. I'm looking forward very much to what they'll be doing."
"I've asked them to help us stay imbued with this culture of innovation. It's one of the enduring characteristics of our institutions, one of the things that makes us the best. It's not surprising that the most innovative society in human history also has the finest national security structure of any society."
"It's an exciting time. It reminds me of the collaboration between companies, universities, and government that built the Internet, and GPS. I remember that. Before that communication satellites and jet engines, and I'm happy to say I'm not that old, but I read about it."
"Those interested in foreign policy and national security, there are lots of interesting challenges and problems to work on. And, that's also true for those interested in technology, but the intersection of the two, that is really very interesting, and many opportunities for partnership in everything we face."
"These issues, as you know, because you've taken the time to sit here today, these really matter. They have to do with our protection and our security in creating a world where our fellow citizens can get up in the morning, take their kids to school, go to work, live their lives, dream their dreams, give their children a better future. You can't do that without security."
"Helping defend your country, helping defend all this, and make a better world is one of the noblest things that a business leader, or a technologist, or an entrepreneur or young person can do, and we're grateful to all of you for doing that with us. Thanks."
"Good afternoon everyone, and, Richard, thanks. Thanks so much for those words, for decades of friendship, your leadership here at the Council, and above all for your public service, which continues, as Richard is a member of the Department’s Defense Policy Board, we count on him for advice on all subjects all the time.  He and I were just talking shortly before this about some things that he is preparing to give us some advice on in just a few weeks’ time."
"It’s nice to see a lot of old friends here at the Council. I looked at the list of attendees coming and it was like a homecoming in many, many ways.  Great to visit all my friends, and to be here at the Council.  Because for generations now, the Council has hosted the debates and supported the thinkers and ideas that have shaped America’s relationship with the world.  And those ideas are important as ever, as we enter a new strategic era.  Indeed, today's security environment is dramatically different from the one we've had for the last 25 years."
"In this era, we face no fewer five evolving major, immediate challenges:  countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe; managing historic change in the vital Asia-Pacific region, including China’s rise, which we welcome, and some of its actions, such as in the South China Sea, about which we share the serious concerns of all in the region; strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s continued nuclear pursuits and provocations; checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Gulf and protecting our friends and allies, especially Israel; and accelerating the defeat of ISIL in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria and everywhere it’s metastasizing around the world, as well as protecting our people here in the homeland. "
"The United States, and the Department of Defense, must and will address all five of those challenges.  To do so is going to require new strategic and operational approaches, new force posture in many places, and large investments in new and enhanced capabilities.  And all this we’re doing.  "
"But today, I want to talk to you about how we are meeting the challenges and seizing the opportunities in the Asia-Pacific, and in particular our growing security network there.  Almost all the nations there are asking us to do more with them…bilaterally and multilaterally.  Tomorrow, as Richard said, I leave for India and the Philippines, and I’m going to highlight today some of the advances we’ll be announcing along the way."
"The Asia-Pacific is, Richard made this point, the single most consequential region for America's future.  We have long played an essential and pivotal role in that region.  And we’re working today, both individually and with our allies and partners, to ensure the Asia-Pacific remains a region where everyone – everyone – can rise and prosper. "
"That has been America’s objective and practice for decades.  Regardless of what else was going on at home or in other parts of the world – during Democratic and Republican administrations, in times of surplus and deficit, war and peace – the United States has played a pivotal role…economically, politically, and militarily in the Asia-Pacific.  "
"Along with a wide variety of partners and allies, for decades we have stood tall for enduring principles, including peaceful resolution of disputes, and the freedom of navigation and overflight.  We helped ensure that countries can make their own security and economic choices, free from coercion and intimidation.  And we’ve promoted free trade and the rule of law to support development and unprecedented growth. "
"Of course, fundamentally, sustaining this human progress requires as a foundation security and stability.  And the United States has helped provide both with its strong defense engagement in the region.  The highly capable men and women of the American armed forces, and our unique technology and assets, coupled to our values, have long provided the necessary reassurance – an attractive, and appealing reassurance – and worked to keep the peace, in the Asia-Pacific.  And because we have done so inclusively, in a principled and respectful way, we have developed alliances and partnerships all over the region.  These relationships – nurtured over decades, tested in crisis, and built on shared interests, values, and sacrifice – form the bedrock of our role in the Asia-Pacific, and, accordingly, its stability and prosperity.  "
"The results have been extraordinary – in the interests of, and to the benefit of, all nations, including the United States.  Since World War II, millions have been lifted from poverty and into the middle class.  And even though there’s still room for improvement, democracy and freedom have spread to places across the region.  And economic miracle after miracle has occurred in the region: first Japan, then Taiwan, South Korea, Southeast Asia, rose and prospered, and now, today, China and India are doing the same. "
"This progress creates opportunities for the region to continue to grow.  But of course, dramatic change also can produce some negatives.  And, recently, not all the news out of the Asia-Pacific has been positive: indeed, in the South China Sea, China’s actions – in particular – are raising regional tensions.  "
"That’s why countries across the Asia-Pacific are voicing concern with militarization, and especially – over the last year – with China’s actions, which stand out in size and scope…they’re voicing those concerns publicly and privately, at the highest levels, in regional meetings, and global fora.  That’s why many of those countries are reaching out anew to the United States to uphold the rules and principles that have allowed the region to thrive.  That’s why we support intensified regional diplomacy, not increased tensions, the threat of force, or unilateral changes to the status quo.  And that’s one reason why we are making enormous investments in our capabilities; why so many are asking us to do more with them; and why we’ll continue to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows.  Because we must continue the progress that has helped so many in the region rise and prosper. "
President Obama launched the rebalance to the Asia-Pacific to ensure that we do our part to make that bright opportunity come to pass. 
"While I am of course absorbed myself with the defense component of the rebalance, I should be clear that one of the most important strategic parts of the rebalance is the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact.  TPP will bind the United States more closely together with 11 other economies, and unlock economic opportunities for the United States and many of its allies and partners.  And TPP will help reinforce the open and inclusive economic approach that has benefited so many in the Asia-Pacific."
"TTP should be ratified because of its economic and strategic benefits, and because we must recognize what the alternative to TPP really is: a regional economy with standards that don’t serve American interests, and one that’s carved up by lop-sided, coercively negotiated, lower-standard deals.  That’s why I’ve said that TPP is as strategically important to the rebalance as an aircraft carrier, and I strongly urge Congress to approve TPP this year.  "
"Militarily, the Department of Defense is operationalizing the next phase of the rebalance, and cementing it for the long term.  "
"We are enhancing America's force posture throughout this vitally important region to continue playing a pivotal role from the sea, in the air, and under the water, as well as to make our posture more geographically distributed, operationally resilient, and politically sustainable.  To do so we continue to bring the best people and platforms forward to the Asia-Pacific – not only increasing the number of U.S. military personnel in the region, part of some 365,000 assigned the Asia-Pacific today, but also sending and stationing some of our most advanced capabilities there.  That includes F-22 and F-35 stealth fighter jets, P-8 Poseidon maritime surveillance aircraft, continuous deployments of B-2 and B-52 strategic bombers, and also our newest surface warfare ships, like the amphibious assault ship U.S.S America, and all three of our newest class of stealth destroyers, the DDG-1000, which will all be homeported with the Pacific fleet.  And all the while, we’re bringing America’s regional force posture into the 21st century, by rotating American personnel into new and more places, like northern Australia and new sites in the Philippines, and modernizing our existing footprint in Japan and the Republic of Korea.  How we’re doing this is a reflection of a shift we’re making across the Army, Navy, Air Force, and the Marine Corps – after fifteen years of intensive effort in counter insurgency in Iraq and Afghanistan – toward full-spectrum operations."
"In our 2017 defense budget, which I’ve presented to Congress over the past few weeks, we are making investments critical to the rebalance.  One is our surface fleet, which under our budget grows both the number of ships and, importantly, above all, their capabilities – to deter, and if deterrence fails, defeat even the most advanced potential naval adversaries, and protect the maritime security we all depend on.  Just one new example of how we’re making our ships’ capabilities increasingly lethal is by maximizing production of the SM-6 missile, one of our most modern and capable munitions, which now has a brand new anti-ship capability – and I could go on.  We’re also investing to ensure our continued air superiority and global reach, including with over $12 billion for the new B-21 Long-Range Strike Bomber.  Another investment is in undersea capabilities, where we continue to dominate and where we’re investing over $8 billion just next year to ensure ours is the most lethal and most advanced undersea and anti-submarine force in the world.  That includes new undersea drones – in multiple sizes and diverse payloads – that can, importantly operate in shallow waters where manned submarines can’t.  We’re also making large new investments in cyber, electronic warfare, and space capabilities, a total of $34 billion just next year.  Among other things, this will help build our cyber mission force, develop next-generation electronic jammers, and prepare for the possibility of a conflict that extends into space.  And more is coming, including some surprises."
"We’re also strengthening our alliances and partnerships, which will be the focus of my trip this coming week.  And in that regard, let me take you on a brief tour of what we are doing with partners around the region, and then focus on India and the Philippines where I’ll be traveling next week and important advances are being made that occasion my trip. "
"Our alliances and partnerships are and will remain one of our most important strategic assets.  Our allies around the world, including those in the Asia-Pacific, have stood with us – and fought with us – time and again, most recently in Iraq, Afghanistan, and against ISIL.  And we are just as committed to them.  As history has shown, we have fought with our friends and allies – and to defend the principles and values we share – in the Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and elsewhere. "
"While I can’t take the time to detail it today, both Japan and Republic of Korea are strengthening their own militaries, and changing how they operate within our alliances in fundamental and forward-looking ways.  We’re sharing our best and newest capabilities, including the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which we’ll soon begin to operate with Japan and the Republic of Korea.  Meanwhile, we’re developing newer partnerships, with Vietnam, with Malaysia, with Indonesia and others, while also enhancing our high-performing partnership with Singapore.  And we’re holding more numerous and more sophisticated exercises with a growing network of partner countries, none larger than this summer’s RIMPAC, which will bring together more than two dozen navies – nearly twice the number that participated just six years ago – to develop the relationships that are critical to ensuring the safety and security and peace of the region’s sea lanes."
"You can see the breadth and depth of our bilateral efforts with one of our key growing partners: India, where I’ll arrive a short time from now.  The U.S.-India relationship is destined to be one of the most significant partnerships of the 21st century.  Ours are two great nations that share a great deal: democratic governments, multiethnic and multicultural societies with a commitment to individual freedom and inclusivity and growing, innovative, open economies."
"Over the course of my years at the Defense Department, I have seen a remarkable convergence of U.S. and Indian interests – what I call a strategic handshake.  As the United States is reaching west in its rebalance, India is reaching east, in Prime Minister Modi’s “Act East” policy that will bring it farther into the Indian and Pacific Oceans.  "
"We see this handshake reflected in the Joint Strategic Vision Statement that President Obama and Prime Minister Modi released last January, and the 2015 Framework for the U.S.-India Defense Relationship, also a new thing, which Indian Defense Minister Parrikar and I signed last year in Delhi.  The Defense Framework is foundational and it’s going to guide the U.S.-India defense relationship for the next decade."
"There’s another handshake between our countries as well – a technological one.  In 2012, the United States and India created the Defense Technology and Trade Initiative  to leverage the convergence between our industrial and technological abilities in an unprecedented way – This, after half a century since Indian independence, of separation of our militaries and our industrial systems – that Initiative grasps hands with Prime Minister Modi’s “Make in India” campaign to expand the nation’s industrial and defense base, and it will lead to greater co-production and co-development of defense capabilities.  While in India, I will meet with Prime Minister Modi and also Defense Minister Parrikar to discuss the progress we’ve made together in aircraft carrier, jet fighter, and jet engine collaboration.  And we’ll talk about exciting new projects, the details of which I can’t go into this afternoon.  But stay tuned for when I meet with Minister Parrikar."
"There is so much potential here, which is why we’re seizing every opportunity we can.  Last year, the Modi government reached out to the United States to discuss the possibility of launching joint production on a new platform, to build on the work Lockheed Martin and Indian industry achieved on the C-130J project, and what Boeing and Indian industry will achieve in the production of the Apache and Chinook helicopters India – recently purchased."
"Members of my team, and industry, are right now – as we are here in New York – in India looking at the potential production of fighter aircraft.  These conversations represent the growing enthusiasm of the U.S.-India partnership, and even more than that, its promise.  While these negotiations can be difficult and global competition is high, I have no doubt that in the coming years, the United States and India will embark on a landmark co-production agreement that will bring our two countries closer together and make our militaries stronger. "
"As our strategic and technological interests have drawn together, so too have our military ties.  We are coming together operationally across domains – by air, land, and sea – to collaborate in humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, maritime security, and maritime domain awareness.  This week, we will also conclude several important agreements, including one on commercial shipping information exchange, which will make many new things possible in the future.  "
"Our gathering partnership in defense can also be seen in India’s return to major joint exercises like RED FLAG, our prestigious, U.S. Air Force-hosted aerial combat training exercise where all our top pilots – and those from countries like India – train together.  India will again participate in the RIMPAC – as I mentioned, the world’s largest international maritime exercise.  And, in the MALABAR exercise, Japan, India, and the United States – all three – have operated together at sea in such critical training as air defense and anti-submarine warfare.  "
"From India, I’ll travel to the Philippines, with which we have one of our longest relationships in the region.  We share much history and many common ties with the Philippines.  And our long-running defense alliance has been a cornerstone of peace and stability in the region for more than 65 years.  And as President Obama’s made clear: our commitment to the Philippines is ironclad."
"Today, our alliance is as close as it has been in many years, thanks to two major recent steps forward that occasion my visit in coming days: first is the U.S.-Philippines Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, or EDCA, a landmark agreement ratified in the Philippines in January, and also the new U.S. Southeast Asia Maritime Security Initiative by which we – that is, the Department of Defense – are helping to fund these changes in the Philippines and other partners. "
"As part of EDCA’s implementation, we’re supporting modernization of the Philippine Armed Forces and strengthening mutual defense, an arrangement that will allow our forces, at the invitation of the Government of the Philippines, to conduct regular rotational training, exercises, and activities.  "
"We recently announced an initial slate of five EDCA Agreed Locations for the alliance activities, locations arrayed throughout the archipelago that will offer the opportunity for increasingly complex bilateral engagements.  I plan to visit two of those locations next week: first, Fort Magsaysay and Antonio Bautista Air Force Base.  "
"At Fort Magsaysay, the former [sic – future] home of the Philippine Army’s premier training facility, we previously made use of limited pre-positioned disaster relief supplies that supported our response to Typhoon Haiyan in 2013.  EDCA will enable us to augment these stocks and add new ones to the air base, thereby improving our ability to respond to future disasters.  I’ll be discussing more at both of these sites when I arrive in the Philippines."
"And, last year at the region’s Shangri-La Dialogue, I announced our Maritime Security Initiative.  This initiative represents a $425-million-dollar, five-year commitment by the Defense Department to help countries like the Philippines share information, identify potential threats, and work collaboratively to address common challenges in the region."
"We’ve just released the first tranche of this money, nearly 80 percent of which is going to the Philippines.  There it will help modernize the technology and train staff at the Philippines National Coast Watch Center, enhance an information network to enable the sharing of classified communications between U.S. Pacific Command in Hawaii and key Philippines maritime command centers, provide an aerostat reconnaissance platform, and outfit Philippine navy patrol vessels with better sensors so they can see and do more in the region’s waters."
"These two things, EDCA and the Maritime Security Initiative will take the U.S.-Philippines alliance capability to a new level, one has not seen in decades.  I will also see some of this firsthand at Exercise BALIKATAN 2016, our premier exercise with the Philippines.  Balikatan is going on right now, and it includes over 7,000 personnel from every military service in both countries, dozens of American aircraft, vehicles, and vessels, including one of our air craft carriers, and several important components, including a simulated gas and oil platform recovery raid in the South China Sea."
"Balikatan signals shared resolve.  It enhances our shared capabilities.  And it demonstrates, once again, America’s dedication to standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the Philippines."
"Like our alliance with the Philippines and our developing partnership with India, America’s bilateral relationships remain the bedrock of our presence and engagement in the Asia-Pacific.  But in a large and interconnected region, especially one with so many strong, capable, and dedicated players, it makes sense to network and link relationships to produce gains for all.  "
"That’s what we are doing.  Now, unlike elsewhere in the world, peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific has never been maintained by a region-wide alliance like NATO – no comparable, formal structure .  That’s made sense for the Asia-Pacific, with its unique history, geography, and politics.  Instead, regional security, stability, and prosperity have required nations working together less formally, and the United States has been an important builder, cement, and participant in this arrangement."
"Today, as the region changes, the United States is augmenting our bilateral relationships and alliances with trilateral and multilateral arrangements.  And we’re weaving these partnerships together to more effectively bolster American and regional security.  This network – with its shared values, habits of cooperation, and compatible and complementary capabilities –will expand the reach of all, responsibly share the security burden, and help ensure the peace and stability in the region for years to come.  "
This burgeoning network builds in three ways.
"First, the Defense Department is strongly emphasizing trilateral mechanisms to bring together like-minded allies and partners to maximize individual contributions to regional peace and security and link together nations that previously worked with us mostly separately.  For example, the U.S.-Japan-Korea trilateral partnership helps us all work together as well as share information and coordinate responses to, for example, North Korean provocations.  Last month’s trilateral meeting between President Obama, Prime Minister Abe of Japan, and President Park on this topic was historic. "
"The U.S.-Japan-Australia relationship is also expanding practical cooperation; enhancing exercises, training, and information sharing; and building capabilities.  And our burgeoning U.S.-Japan-India trilateral relationship is evolving from a strategic dialogue – where it began – through joint activities like the MALABAR Exercise, to real, practical security cooperation that spans the entire region from the subcontinent right around to East Asia."
"Second, to improve regional security, we’re encouraging our allies and partners to actively develop their own interconnected security relationships.  Many countries within the Asia-Pacific are strengthening their bilateral relationships with one another in ways that we think enhance regional stability, but they’re also creating their own trilateral arrangements.  The Japan-Australia-India trilateral meeting last June was a welcome development."
"Third, we are helping create an interconnected regional architecture – from one end of the region to another – through engagement and activities in multilateral fora, such as the ASEAN Defense Ministers Meeting.  In this way, the United States is helping strengthen relationships and building partner capabilities on key issues like maritime security, humanitarian assistance, and disaster relief.  Singapore has shown great leadership in this area by hosting an operations center to coordinate activities across ASEAN."
"It’s important to remember, that our bilateral, trilateral, and multinational relationships, and the developing network they comprise, is not aimed at any particular country.  Rather, it demonstrates that the region wants cooperation, not coercion, and a continuation, not an end, of decades of stability, peace, and progress.  "
"The network’s not closed and excludes no one: we want cooperation and shared leadership so that as other nations want to contribute to regional stability and security, they can work with the other nations of the region to do so.  For example, we have disagreements with China, but we are committed to working through them in ways that do not destabilize the region.  That is one reason why we will continue to pursue a military-to-military relationship with China focused on risk reduction and practical cooperation in areas of mutual interest.  "
"This network, over all, demonstrates the United States’ commitment to remaining a pivotal and essential leader in the Asia-Pacific for decades to come.  By operationalizing the rebalance, by transforming old alliances and new partnerships, and by networking security, we can gather force and respond to any manner of crisis, man-made or natural disaster, and continue to promote and defend the principles that have allowed so many in the region to rise and proper for so long. "
"Let me close with a few words, about who makes that possible. As I stand here, there are hundreds of thousands of men and women serving and defending our country, right now, in every time zone, in every domain…in the air, ashore, and afloat.  They’re the ones who are operationalizing the rebalance.  They’re making the network work. They need always to be in our minds."
"You know, they say that security – frequently, this is said in that region – is like oxygen…when you have enough of it, you pay no attention to it.  But when you don’t have enough, you can think of nothing else.  America’s servicemembers provide the oxygen…the security that allows millions upon millions of people, not just in America, and not just in the Asia-Pacific, but in so much of the world to be safe, to raise their children, to dream their dreams, to live lives that are full.  "
"Our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines take grave risks to provide that security, and some make the ultimate sacrifice.  They do so not just because they were ordered to.  They do so not only because they want to protect their buddies.  They do so because they know they help make the world a better place through American leadership. "
"In a new strategic era, and at a time of great change, we must and will continue that play that essential, principled role in the Asia-Pacific.  We will work with new partners, and old allies.  We will network our security relationships.  We will invest and innovate…we will change how we plan, how we operate, and even how we fight.  "
"But we’ll never change what we are willing to fight for: for our safety and freedoms, for that of our friends and allies, and for the values, principles, and rules-based order that produced security, stability, and prosperity for all.  Because we do so, we will continue to ensure the Asia-Pacific remains a region where everyone can rise and prosper for generations to come."
Thank you.  
"Good afternoon, everyone. And thanks, John. I appreciate that. And thanks for all you do."
"On shore and afloat, in the air and under the sea, in every time zone around the world, our men and women in uniform are confronting these challenges in order to protect the American people and our interests worldwide. "
"And in order to ensure that they have the capabilities that they need, we're making decisions based on the challenges we face and the right strategies that will help us to meet them. And we're pursuing new technology development, along with new operational concepts and new organizational constructs, all of which are reflected in or supported by our 2017 budget submission to maintain our military's technological superiority and assure we always have an operational advantage over any potential adversary.
Our budget refocuses the Navy on building lethality for high-end conflicts. We're looking at our overall warfighting posture, which is signified by presence, because it's overall posture that determines whether our maritime forces can deter and if necessary win a full- spectrum conflict. Our budget this year increases the number of ships to meet the department's 308-ship posture requirement by 2021. And even more importantly, it will make our naval forces more capable, more survivable, and more lethal, too."
"Lethality is the key word here, as Admiral Richardson has stressed. We're investing in ways to make our weapons more lethal, as well as making our ships harder to find and harder to attack. "
"That's why our investments reflect an emphasis on payloads over platforms alone, on the ability to strike from sanctuary quickly so that no target is out of reach, and on closing capability shortfalls that have developed over the last several years.
First, the budget maximizes our undersea advantage – an area where we should be and will be doing more, not less, going forward. It provides funding for important payloads and munitions, included in improved heavy weight torpedo, as well as research and development for an advanced lightweight torpedo.  It includes $29.4 billion to buy nine Virginia-class attack submarines over the next five years – four of those submarines, up from three in last year's budget, will be equipped with a versatile Virginia Payload Module, which can more than triple each submarine's strike capacity.
Next week, I'll see a Virginia-class-ship building up close in Groton. The budget also includes new funding for unmanned, undersea systems in multiple sizes and diverse payloads that can, importantly, operate in shallow waters where manned submarines cannot.
Second, the budget makes significant investments to bolster the lethality of our surface fleet forces, so they can deter and if necessary, prevail in a full spectrum conflict, even against most advanced adversaries. It maximizes production of the SM-6, one of our most modern and capable missiles, an investment doubly important, given the SM-6's new anti-ship capability. And it invests in developing and acquiring several other key munitions and payloads, including the SM-3 high altitude ballistic missile interceptor, the Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile, and the most advanced Tactical Tomahawk land-attack missile, which is being upgraded for maritime strike.
The budget also invests a total of $18.3 billion to buy two Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers each year over the next five years – a total of 10 – as well as nearly $3 billion for modernizing our destroyers, 12 of which will also receive upgrades to their combat systems.  It continues to support 11 carrier strike groups, investing a total of more than $13 billion for new construction of Ford-class carriers, and it supports modernizing our guided missile cruisers.
And third, to ensure the U.S. military's and our sea services' continued air superiority and global reach, the budget makes important investments in aviation platforms and payloads. We're investing a total of $8 billion in a wide range of versatile munitions, including buying more of the Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile, as I said, the extended range of Anti-Radiation Guided Missile too, and the AIM-120D air-to-air missiles.
In particular, our Naval Aviation component is focused on the concept of integrated warfare to project power over and from the sea, and at the heart of this concept with the F-35, the P-8, and other air assets that are critical nodes which capture and disseminate information in an unprecedented manner, ultimately improving lethality across the battle space. That's one reason why we're maturing our investments in the stealthy five generation F-35 JSF, and to make sure our fleet has a sufficient quantity of advanced tactical aircraft long into the future, our budget also increases the Navy and the Marine Corps F-35 procurements. We're completing procurement in the advanced P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol and surveillance aircraft as well."
"We're also buying an additional 16 F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighter jets between now and F.Y. 2018, providing a significant boost to the health of the Navy and Marine Corps fourth generation fighter aircraft fleet so it's ready and capable for today's missions. And lastly, to address the Navy and Marine Corps maintenance backlog in tactical aviation, the budget funds a 15 percent increase in F/A-18 depot maintenance capacity for the Navy and the Marine Corps."
"With this budget, our fleet will be larger and our sea services will be much more effective, potent and lethal than they are today because they'll be equipped with the weapons and the advanced capabilities that they will need to deter any aggressor, and make any aggressor, who isn't deterred, very much regret their decision to take on the United States."
"Now, in order to maintain that lethality and capability ahead of all others in what is, after all, a competitive world, we need to continue to invest in innovation, to think outside of our five-sided box. That's why one of my top priorities as Secretary of Defense is to build, and in some cases to rebuild, the bridges between the Pentagon and the innovative business community that for decades has buttressed one of America's greatest strengths, namely superior technology. And as I'm building bridges from the DOD side, I know there are those in the private sector, including members of the Navy League represented here today, who are building from the other, and we appreciate that. "
"Our men and women in uniform operate in an increasingly competitive and changing world – particularly when it comes to technology. And when I began my career, most technology of consequence originated in America, and much of that was sponsored by the government, particularly by the Department of Defense. "
"Now, today, we're still major sponsors, but much more technology is commercial and the technology base is global. "
"Indeed, technologies once possessed by only the most formidable militaries have now come into the hands of previously less-capable militaries and even non-state actors. Meanwhile, nations like Russia and China are modernizing their militaries to try to close the technology gap."
"So to stay ahead of those challenges, to stay the best, and to keep our edge, we're investing aggressively in high-end innovation and to enhance our own asymmetric and hybrid capabilities. "
"For example, we're investing a combined total of $34 billion across the cyber, electronic warfare and space domains in F.Y. '17 alone. We're building fast, resilient microdrones that can be kicked out the back of a fighter jet moving at Mach .9 and fly through heavy winds."
"We're developing an arsenal plane, which will function as a very large airborne magazine with different conventional payloads, networked to fifth-generation aircraft that act as forward sensors and targeting nodes. And for the Navy, we're working on autonomous, self-driving boats, which can network together to do all sorts of missions, from fleet defense to close-in  surveillance – including around an island, real or artificial – without putting our sailors at risk. These are just a few of many examples."
"Overall, our budget invests nearly $72 billion in R&D. To give you a little context, that's more than double what Apple, Intel and Google spent on R&D last year combined. That includes $12.5 billion specifically invested in science and technology to support groundbreaking work happening in the military services in our dozens of DOD labs and engineering centers across the country, and at DARPA to develop and advance disruptive technologies and capabilities in areas like undersea systems, hypersonics, electronic warfare, big data analytics, advanced materials, energy and propulsion, robotics, autonomy, and advanced sensing in computing.
And at the same time, we're also investing in further partnerships with our nation's innovative private-sector in technology communities – in places like Boston, Silicon Valley, Austin, Seattle, Northern Virginia and America's many, many other hubs of globally unrivaled innovation.
Last week, I visited and announced enhancements to a path-breaking innovation hub that we launched in Silicon Valley. I call it the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental, or DIUx – which is essentially an outpost of us, of the Pentagon on the West Coast – to help broaden the range of great companies that we work with. We've launched and funded Manufacturing Innovation Institutes across the country to advance emerging technologies like flexible hybrid electronics, which will make it possible to seamlessly print lightweight, flexible, structural integrity sensors right onto the surface of ships and aircraft; revolutionary textiles which combine fibers and yarns with things like circuits and LEDs, solar cells, electronic sensors and other capabilities to create fabrics that can see and hear and sense and communicate, store energy, regulate temperature, monitor health, change color and much more.
But as good as America's technology is, it's nothing compared to our people – they're the reason why our military is the finest fighting force the world has ever known. It's them. And in the future, our mission requires that we continue to recruit and retain the very best talent. That's why we opened up all combat positions to women who qualify, in order to expand our access to 100 percent of Americans for our all-volunteer force.
It's also why we're building what I call the Force of the Future, to ensure that amid changes in generations, technologies and labor markets, we're always postured to bring in, develop and retain young men and women as fine as the ones it's our privilege to have in our military today.
Last November, I announced the first link to the Force of the Future, with over a dozen new initiatives, including programs such as the Defense Digital Service, which brings in talent from America's vibrant, innovative business community for a time—a few months, a year, a project—to help solve some of our most complex problems, and also expanding opportunities for those currently in DOD both military and civilian to gain new skills, experiences and perspectives by working outside of DOD. And reforms to improve and modernize our talent management systems, to make sure that we recruit, train and retain the best people for our best -- for our force in the best possible way."
"In January, I announced the second link, a set of several initiatives with a singular focus: strengthening the support we provide our military families because this is, after all, a married force in the Navy. To improve their quality of life and for our purposes, get them to stay, stick with us, including expanded maternity and paternity leave, as well as extended childcare on our bases and giving families the possibility of some geographic flexibility in return for additional commitments.
Competing for good people for an all-volunteer force is a critical part of our military edge, and everyone should understand this need any my commitment to it. And our work on this front continues full steam ahead – and while these first two links are important – we'll have more to announce on the Force of the Future in coming weeks.
In order to meet the challenges of the future, we're also innovating operationally, making sure that our contingency plans and operations are more flexible and dynamic in every region. Because our military has to have the agility and ability to win, both the fights we're in and the wars that could happen tomorrow—the ones we're in, the ones that could happen today and the ones that could happen tomorrow, I should say all three—we're always updating our plans and developing new operational approaches to account for any changes in potential adversary threats and capabilities, always innovating to stay ahead of that—including ways to overcome emerging threats, such as cyberattacks, anti-satellite weapons, hybrid threats and anti-access area denial systems. And because we owe it to America's taxpayers to spend our defense dollars as wisely and responsibly as possible, we're also pushing for needed reforms across the Defense enterprise. "
"As a learning organization, DOD has a long history of striving to reform our command structures and improve how our strategies and policies are formulated, integrated and implemented. That's why last month I proposed several reforms to the Goldwater-Nichols Act – for example, to improve the Chairman of Joint Chief's ability to integrate, on my and the President's behalf, our military capabilities across domains and across cross-regional and cross-functional challenges, to simplify command and control and address where headquarters have become less efficient than they should be and to streamline our acquisition system. And I appreciate that the House and the Senate have advanced several of our recommendations in the annual National Defense Authorization Act.
In other areas, though, I have concerns about some of the reform proposals being put forward. One area I must comment on is the proposal—the Senate version of the NDAA—to extensively reorganize the functions of the Under Secretary for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics. "
"I believe strongly in acquisition reform. It's a competitive world and we need to make the best use of taxpayer dollars. I appreciate the serious attention that both SASC and HASC have given this imperative in their bills. I share the views of the SASC that over time, the acquisition executive’s position has become so preoccupied with program management, including a lot of unnecessary bureaucracy associated with it, that perhaps takes some management attention away from the research and engineering function."
"In fact, I know this myself because I once served as the Under Secretary for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, and I know the research and engineering function, both as an engineer and scientist and also because my first job was for then-Secretary of Defense Harold Brown, who had been a Director of Defense, Research and Engineering. And his Under Secretary, who was called the Under Secretary for Research and Engineering, not AT&L, in those days, was Bill Perry, who also became Secretary of Defense. "
"And I worked for and with every other incumbent of that job as it was renamed over time, including on the Defense Science Board for Robert McNamara’s Director of Defense, Research and Engineering, who was the Chairman of the DSB, Johnny Foster.
So, I do, however, have a serious caution: separating research and engineering from manufacturing, which is implied in this proposal, could introduce problems in the transition from the research and engineering phase to the production phase and then to the sustainment phase, and that is in fact, a frequent stumbling block for programs.
One need only remember the Joint Strike Fighter's growing pains, which I remember quite well, in moving from Engineering and Manufacturing Design, to Low-Rate Initial Reduction.
Procurement and sustainment are tightly coupled with technology and engineering and development, and those two together represent about 90 percent of program cost. So, separating these functions makes no sense, as procurement and sustainment costs are controlled by decisions made during development. This proposal could also derail the success we've had lowering our contract cost grow in the most high-risk contracts to what is now a 35-year low. Finally, an overly prescriptive approach risks unhelpful micro-management with a high potential for negative second and third order effects. So, I would like to work with the committees on this and other provisions of their bill.
I'm also compelled to address the budget gimmickry included in the proposed NDAA in the House."
"Most disturbingly, it raids war funds in a time of war, when we have men and women deployed in operations in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. It also threatens the budget stability that undergirds all of the reforms, investments and initiatives I've detailed here today. And it threatens the readiness of the force – an actual contrast to the narrative its proponents propound. Now, I was an early advocate for Washington to escape gridlock, and to come together behind an agreement along the lines of last fall's Bipartisan Budget Act, for we in the Department are very grateful. The passage of this act gave us some much needed stability to plan and build for the future, after years of gridlock and turbulence. "
"That budget deal set the size of our budget, and with this degree of certainty, we focused on its shape and building the FY 2017 budget we've submitted and I've described—changing that shape in fundamental but carefully considered ways to adjust to a new strategic year end to seize opportunities for the future."
But the budget stability that was supposed to last for two years is already under threat after only six months with a proposal to underfund DOD's overseas warfighting accounts by $18 billion and spend that money on programmatic items we didn't request. This approach is deeply troubling. It's flawed for several reasons.
"First and foremost for me, it's gambling with warfighting money at a time of war, proposing to cut off funding for ongoing operations in the middle of the fiscal year. Moreover, it would spend money taken from the war account on things, as I said, that are not DOD's highest priorities across the joint force. "
"It's a step in the direction of unraveling the Bipartisan Budget Act, which provided critical stability the DOD needs and leaves us facing now the Department's greatest strategic threat, which is a return to sequestration, a $100 billion in looming, automatic cuts beginning next year if this isn't fixed.
And it's another road to nowhere with uncertain chances of ever becoming a law, and a high probability of leading to more gridlock and another continuing resolution -- exactly the kind of terrible distraction we've had for years. It undercuts stable planning and efficient use of taxpayer dollars, dispirits troops and their families, baffles friends, and emboldens foes.
Particularly concerning is the potential impact of this proposal on the readiness of our force. Whether taken from overseas contingency operations or added on top of existing resources, buying force structure in this fiscal year without the resources to sustain it in future years is not the path to increased readiness. It's a path to a hollow force. It exacerbates the readiness challenges we currently have. Our readiness recovery plans are centered on synchronized and sustainable manning, training and equipping pipelines that are rigorously shaped based on the size of the force."
"For that reason, increasing the size of the force without sustaining our ranges and schoolhouses over time doesn't produce readiness. Buying additional force structure without expanding depots and shipyards in the years to come doesn't produce readiness.
Simply put, readiness is the most critical priority right now for each one of our services. And that's why our budget aggressively funded the readiness plans of each of the services, based on the most that is actually executable such as, for example, take an Army example, the maximum number of rotations through the National Training Centers. Readiness is the core of our mission, from the forces on the Korean Peninsula standing ready to “fight tonight,” to the ships patrolling the Persian Gulf, to the pilots flying over the Baltics. And the readiness of our men and women in uniform to carry out their missions and return home safely will always be my highest priority. Looking ahead, that's why I ordered a strategic portfolio review to determine if we are doing everything possible to help the services continue to recover their high-end combat readiness next year. We'll make adjustments to our plans in funding in FY 2018 based on the outcome of that review.
The raids on wartime funding in the House authorization bill and the concerning approach to reforming our research, engineering and acquisition enterprise in the Senate bill represent two specific concerns. The fact is, these bills have become lengthy and extraordinarily prescriptive. And the pages and provisions continue to accumulate from year to year. It's cumulative. They've been used repeatedly to block necessary reform in the Department, such as BRAC, and a wide range of force management approaches which are needed to sustain our enterprise and operate effectively.
I would respectfully suggest that the informed expert judgment of the civilian and military leadership at the Department of Defense, which is embodied in our budget proposal, should receive greater support and be subject to less micromanagement.
If a final version of the NDAA reaches the President this year and includes a raid on war funding that risks stability and gambles with war funding, jeopardizes readiness and rejects key judgments in the department, I'll be compelled to recommend that he veto the bill. I'm hopeful, however, that we can work with Congress to achieve a better solution. Our warfighters deserve nothing less because our mission is a deadly serious one."
"It's been said that security is like oxygen; when you have enough of it, you tend to pay no attention to it, but when you don't have enough, you can think of nothing else. The men and women of our military are not only defending the United States and its people, they're providing the oxygen that provides better lives and a better world.
It's in the new commitment. I saw the same dedication to these principles last month when I was at the American Cemetery in Manila, where 17,000 Americans, many sailors and Marines, are buried after making the ultimate sacrifice in the Pacific. And I see it in our newest personnel and I'm sure I'll see the same commitment in the eyes of our Navy and Marine officers next week at the Naval Academy commencement in Annapolis."
"Because in a new strategic era and a time of great change, we must and will continue to ensure the security, stability and prosperity that has meant so much to so many here at home and around the world. To do so, we'll invest and innovate, we'll change how we plan, how we operate and how we fight. "
"But we'll never change what we're willing to fight for: for our safety and freedoms, for those of our friends and allies and for the values and principles that have produced security, stability and prosperity for all for so long.
With the help of the Navy League and many others in this room, we'll continue to do that for years to come. "

"
"Thank you all, and good afternoon,.  And John, thank you – thank  you for that kind introduction.  It’s good to be back at the Reagan Forum. "
"And I’m pleased to join so many long-time friends of mine and the Defense Department’s among the dedicated and patriotic Americans here – including two of my predecessors, former Secretary of Defense and former Vice President Dick Cheney, and former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta – as well as so many dedicated public servants, like Chairman Mac Thornberry and the Congressional delegation here today; current colleagues, including my Deputy, Bob Work, our Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joe Dunford, and I believe Joe had to leave a little while ago but I know was here earlier today; and many others who contribute to our defense enterprise, such as Lockheed-Martin’s CEO Marillyn Hewson, I don’t know if Marillyn is here, and Raytheon’s CEO Tom Kennedy – all part of the team, America."
Thanks all for your continued support for our servicemembers and their families – there’s Marillyn – and for all your own contributions to our national security.  
"Each of you knows well that America’s defense is so vital that we, to whom it is entrusted, must ensure its continuity and excellence across the years and across the domains of armed conflict – not just sea and air and land, but also in space, and cyberspace – from strategic era to strategic era, from presidential administration to presidential administration, across our government, and across parties. "
"Ensuring that continuity is important at a time of change in administration in Washington.  I’m proud of the way the men and women of DoD conducted themselves during this last presidential campaign, standing apart from politics and staying focused on our mission.  And I’m committed to overseeing the orderly transfer to the next Commander-in-Chief.  That’s something DoD takes a lot of pride in and has done for a long time, and we’re carrying out this year’s changeover with the excellence that’s expected of us.  And let me also congratulate General Jim Mattis for being chosen to take my place.  I’ve worked with Jim for many years.  He’s a friend, and I hold him in the highest regard."
"Of course, the excellence that people expect of our department is due, in part, to the continuity and leadership defense secretaries of both parties have provided to the department over the last seven decades.  Each one of them has strengthened DoD to meet the challenges of their strategic eras, and the future challenges as they saw them, too – with bold actions such as unifying the armed forces at the dawn of the nuclear age; moving to an all-volunteer force after the Vietnam War; leveraging leap-ahead technologies like stealth, precision-guided munitions, and battle networks to forge an unmatched military edge against the Soviet bloc; winning the Cold War and defining U.S. leadership in the era that followed; and waging 21st century counterterrorism and counterinsurgency campaigns."
"I, myself, have lived through, witnessed, and served in all but the earliest of those eras and the strategic transitions between them also:  contributing to programs involving missile defense, space, and the nuclear Triad during the Cold War; overseeing the project to prevent the vast stockpile of Soviet nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons from falling into the wrong hands after the Cold War ended; and in more recent years helping develop and rapidly field critical capabilities like Mine-Resistant Ambush-Protected vehicles for the fights in Afghanistan and Iraq among other places. "
"In this strategic transition, that we’re in right now, we must widen the spectrum of our current and future capabilities to account for this great change – the great change economic, political, military, social, and technological under way – and the greater and the fiercer competition we face.  And I say this because today, DoD confronts no fewer than five immediate, but also distinct, and evolving challenges. "
"We’re countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe – something we haven’t had to worry about for the last 25 years, but now we do.  We’re also managing historic change in the Asia-Pacific – the single most consequential region for America’s future.  We’re strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s continued nuclear and missile provocations.  We’re checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Gulf, and helping defend our friends and allies in the Middle East.  We’re countering terrorism and accelerating the certain and lasting defeat of ISIL.  And, of course, we’re also preparing to contend with an uncertain future – ensuring our military is ready for challenges we may not anticipate today."
"Defending our country in this strategic transition requires that our military be able to deter the most advanced adversaries while continuing to fight terrorist groups.  To be clear, the U.S. military will be ready to fight very differently than we have in Iraq and Afghanistan, or in the rest of the world’s recent memory.  We will, as we must, be prepared for a high-end enemy – what we call full-spectrum.  In our budget, our plans, our training, our capabilities, and our actions, we must demonstrate to potential foes that if they start a war, we will win it.  Because a force meant to deter conflict can only succeed in deterrence if it can show that it will dominate a conflict.  That’s the kind of force I’ve been determined to build for my successors. "
"And that’s why, amidst this strategic transition, it has been necessary – and it will be necessary – for DoD to change, to adapt, and to innovate – not only to meet today’s challenges, but also to ensure our defense’s continued excellence well into an uncertain future. "
"So I want to speak today about how the changes underway to respond to all these challenges – focusing particularly on the military campaign to accelerate the lasting defeat of ISIL, our Strong and Balanced Strategy on Russia, and the rebalance to the vital and dynamic Asia-Pacific.  And I’ll also describe the actions we’re taking – and pioneering innovations underway – to ensure DoD has the technology, the operational plans, the organization, and the people to continue to defend our country and make a better world for decades to come. Let me start in the Middle East, a region of great turbulence and confusion, but where we are not confused – we’re clear about our pursuit of America’s national interests.  Among them is dealing ISIL the lasting defeat that it deserves, and that it will certainly receive."
"We’ve reached a critical milestone in our counter-ISIL military campaign plan.  As we meet today in Simi Valley, American forces are engaged in an intense effort to isolate and collapse ISIL’s control over Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria, bringing the great weight of our entire range of capabilities to bear in the enabling of capable and motivated local forces.  The seizure of these two cities is necessary to ensure the destruction of ISIL’s parent tumor in Iraq and Syria – the primary objective of our military campaign – and put ISIL on an irreversible path to a lasting defeat.  "
"Reaching this milestone is the result of deliberate actions taken since last year.  First, and going back to last summer, I consolidated the war command for Iraq and Syria under a single, unified command – streamlining our command-and-control for the fight against ISIL.  Then, last October, President Obama approved the first in a series of recommendations that I and Joe Dunford made to accelerate the campaign against ISIL – introducing every single tool of our military to the fight, from air power and special operations forces, to our train, advise, assist capabilities on the ground, to our intelligence and cyber tools.  And I should tell you that since then, President Obama has approved every single recommendation that the Chairman and I have taken to him for additional forces and capabilities as we saw – as we constantly have – additional opportunities to accelerate the campaign.  "
The overall Coalition Military Campaign Plan we devised last year has three objectives:  
"The first is to destroy ISIL’s parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, because the sooner we crush both the fact and the idea of an Islamic state based on ISIL’s barbaric ideology, the safer we’ll all be.  Now, that’s necessary, but it’s not sufficient. "
"So the second objective is to combat ISIL’s metastases everywhere they emerge around world: in Afghanistan, Libya, and elsewhere.  "
"And the third objective is to work with our intelligence, homeland security, and law enforcement partners to help protect our homelands and our people from attack – that’s ultimately our most important mission.  "
"The strategic approach of our campaign is to leverage all the tools at DoD’s disposal to enable capable and motivated local forces to apply simultaneous pressure to deal ISIL a lasting defeat.  We recommended this strategic approach because the only way to ensure that once defeated, ISIL stays defeated, is to enable local forces to seize and hold territory rather than to substitute for them.  We’ve been squeezing ISIL from all sides and across domains, through a series of deliberate plays to continue to build momentum.  For example, when our special operators conduct raids, free hostages, gather intelligence, and capture ISIL leaders, it creates a virtuous cycle of better intelligence, which generates more targets and more raids and more air strikes and more opportunities we can seize to gain even more momentum. "
"And as a result, since last year – play by play, accelerant after accelerant, town after town– the campaign has delivered significant results.  "
"In Iraq, we’ve been helping the Iraqi Security Forces and Kurdish Peshmerga to systematically dislodge ISIL from city after city – Ramadi, Hit, Rutbah, Fallujah, Qayyarah, Mahkmur.  And our coalition is now doing the same in Mosul – having isolated the city, the Iraqis with our help are now taking back neighborhoods in eastern Mosul and moving west.  This is a complex mission that will take time to accomplish, but I am confident that ISIL’s days in Mosul are numbered."
"In Syria, we and our local partners put an end to ISIL’s expansion and then began to systematically roll it back toward Raqqa, an important objective since it is the so-called capital of the so-called caliphate, and a hub for plotters of external attacks.  After helping capable, motivated local Syrian forces defend Kobani, we and the coalition enabled them and other local forces to retake Shaddadi, then Tishrin, Manbij, Dabiq – denying ISIL not only control over those areas, but also cutting off some of their primary lines of communication into Turkey and Iraq.  "
"We’re now helping our local partners isolate Raqqa, from which they’re now only 15 miles away.  And as the isolation phase continues according to our coalition military campaign plan, we’re generating the additional local forces necessary to seize and hold Raqqa."
"In addition to taking back territory, our campaign is yielding results in denying ISIL the finances, supplies, freedom of movement, and command and control it needs to survive.  We’ve systematically targeted ISIL-controlled oil wells, trucks for smuggling the oil, and revenue repositories.  We’ve deliberately focused on severing the territory ISIL controls in Syria from the territory it controls in Iraq.  Leaders of the terrorist group can no longer travel between Raqqa and Mosul without the risk of either being hunted down by our Expeditionary Targeting Force or struck from the air.  In fact, since we began accelerating our campaign last year, we’ve killed some of ISIL’s most senior leaders.  "
"While these results in Iraq and Syria are encouraging, we must stay focused on the continued execution of our plan.  The inevitable collapse of ISIL’s control over Mosul and Raqqa will certainly put ISIL on a path to a lasting defeat.  But there will still be much more to do after that to make sure that, once defeated, ISIL stays defeated.  "
"We’ll need to continue to counter foreign fighters trying to escape and ISIL’s attempts to relocate or reinvent itself.  To do so, not only the United States but our coalition must endure and remain militarily engaged. "
"In Iraq in particular, it will be necessary for the coalition to provide sustained assistance and carry on our work to train, equip, and support local police, border guards, and other forces to hold the areas cleared from ISIL.  "
"And beyond security, there will still be towns to rebuild, services to reestablish, and communities to restore.  Those aren’t military matters, but they’re part of how, after winning the battle, one wins the peace.  That’s why my principal concern at this juncture is that the international community’s stabilization and governance efforts will lag behind the military campaign.  "
"There will also need to be continued political support for an inclusive and multi-sectarian Iraq.  In a region rife with sectarianism, the threat of ISIL has brought people together, for now, against this common enemy.  That’s certainly true in Iraq – where, thanks to the unity and leadership of Prime Minister Abadi and Kurdistan Regional Government President Barzani, cooperation between the Iraqi Security Forces and Kurdish Peshmerga in the battle to retake Mosul has reached a level that would have been unthinkable a year ago.  And we’re taking steps to help promote and maintain this unity – for we know that’s the only way to keep ISIL defeated. "
"As I said earlier, success in Iraq and Syria is necessary, but it’s not sufficient to deal ISIL a lasting defeat.  And that’s why we’re also focused on the other two critical objectives of our campaign – combatting ISIL’s metastases around the world, and helping protect our homeland.  "
"When it comes to combatting the metastases, we’ve taken correspondingly strong actions in support of capable and motivated local forces in Libya and Afghanistan and elsewhere.  "
"In Libya, the U.S. military has provided air support to the Government of National Accord and its forces to isolate and collapse ISIL’s control over Sirte.  And as a result, ISIL is being ejected from Sirte.  "
"And in Afghanistan, on Chairman Dunford’s and my recommendation, the President this year gave expanded authorities to U.S. forces to proactively assist and enable our Afghan partners in operations that would have strategic effects.  We also decided to modify our plan in order to retain some 8,400 U.S. troops there into 2017, rather than 5,500 as the earlier plan had called for.  And we will continue to maintain our financial commitment to the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces.  These robust commitments – in authorities and forces and finances – will ensure we not only continue supporting the Afghan security forces, but also sustain our regional counterterrorism platform operated out of Afghanistan.  For example, alongside our Afghan partners, we recently conducted two large-scale operations against ISIL in Afghanistan, killing its top leader in the country and significantly degrading its capabilities there."
"On our campaign’s third objective, protecting the homeland, DoD is working with our intelligence, homeland security, and law enforcement partners both at home – in fact, supporting them is job number-one and priority number one for our Northern Command – but also abroad.  "
"There, we’re conducting operations to gather intelligence with a particular focus on destroying ISIL’s external operations cadre.  As a result, we’ve not only killed the chief of ISIL’s external operations, we’ve also taken out more than 30 of its external plotters.  We’ve gone after Al-Qaeda’s branch in Syria.  We’ve worked with the FBI to systematically eliminate members of an ISIL cell outside the United States that was inspiring attacks against in our country, and including against our armed forces.  And we’ve directed our Joint Special Operations Command to make its top priority destroying ISIL’s external operations capability."
"The campaign against ISIL and its results are another example of our military’s continued excellence and America’s continued leadership in the Middle East and the world.  No other nation could have brought to bear the resources we have, assembled the coalition we’ve built, and led the execution of a comprehensive campaign as the United States has done.  We did so in pursuit of our nation’s interests – which in this case are aligned with many allies and partners who are also resolved to destroy ISIL; and we did so despite major, simultaneous, and growing military commitments in Europe and Asia.  And let me now turn to them."
"First, I want to discuss Europe, where the Transatlantic Community is standing up to Russia’s provocations and aggression.  "
"That’s a big change for many of us who worked productively with Russia in the post-Cold War era.  I know I did so in the 1990s when our two nations were working with sometimes, common, rather than cross, purposes.  At the time, American and Russian militaries collaborated to arrest the spread of loose nuclear weapons as part of the Nunn-Lugar program, and when Russia agreed to join the NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo – I remember both."
"Today, unfortunately, Russia’s aggression and provocation appear to be driven by misguided ambitions and misplaced resentment.  Russia wants to be considered, understandably so, as the important power it is.  And indeed, its history is rich – one of which its people can and should be proud.  But in recent years, some in the Kremlin have reinterpreted that history to fuel grandiose visions and provocative, destabilizing actions abroad.  "
"We see that in Russia’s aggression in Ukraine and Georgia, its counter-productive role in the ongoing tragedy in Syria, its attacks in cyberspace, its violation of arms-control treaties and other international agreements, and, perhaps above all, its nuclear saber-rattling.  These actions are not what the world expects of a responsible state in the twenty-first century; rather, each threatens to undermine global security and erode the principled international order that has been so good not only to the United States, but also to Russia and the world. "
"Let me be clear, the United States does not seek a cold, let alone a hot war with Russia.  We don’t seek an enemy in Russia.  But make no mistake – we will defend our allies, the principled international order, and the positive future it affords all of us.  And we will counter attempts to undermine our collective security.  "
"To do so, the United States is following a Strong and Balanced Strategy.  In it, we’re addressing Russia’s actions and deterring its aggression while pursuing and preserving bilateral cooperation where U.S. and Russian objectives can be aligned.  This strategy for deterrence does not simply recycle the twentieth-century playbook used to deter Soviet aggression during the Cold War, because that playbook would not match the Russian challenge of today. "
"We haven’t had to prioritize deterrence on the Transatlantic Community’s eastern flank for over 20 years.  And unfortunately, now we do.  That’s why the United States is strengthening our deterrence posture in Europe, to adjust our military posture and presence in Europe to be more agile and quicker in responding to the threats that Russia might pose.  Our latest defense budget request includes significantly more funding for our European Reassurance Initiative – more than quadruple what we allocated the year before.  That’s intended to allow us to – in addition to the two brigades we already have stationed in Europe – rotate an Armored Brigade Combat Team into Europe on a persistent basis, and to pre-position a brigade-worth of equipment and warfighting gear to be used by American forces flown into Europe among other steps."
"We’re also increasing military exercises with allies and partners to demonstrate resolve and build their resilience, while enhancing inter-operability.  We’re updating and refining our contingency and operational plans, including ways to overcome emerging threats such as hybrid warfare and anti-access, area-denial systems.  We’re investing in the technologies most relevant to countering Russia – more on these shortly.  And we’re also recapitalizing our nuclear deterrent, because nuclear deterrence is not only the bedrock of our security, but also critical to sustain in light of Russia’s nuclear saber-rattling."
"The United States is not alone in any of this, of course.  For more than 67 years, NATO has been the quintessential example of nations coming together to respond to collective security challenges.  And as it did during the Cold War, NATO will be critical to preserving collective defense in the face of new and renewed threats.  To ensure it does so, we’re working with our allies to adapt this storied alliance to confront the new challenges NATO faces, like Russia."
"NATO, too, has a new playbook – one that prepares to counter cyber threats and hybrid warfare, to better integrate our conventional and nuclear deterrence, and much, much more.  That’s why NATO created a Very-High-Readiness Joint Task Force that can deploy allied forces on 48 hours’ notice to any crisis on allied territory.  It’s why NATO is also deploying four battalions to its eastern flank – one each in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland – the latter is where the United States will lead a battalion starting next year.  And it’s why NATO is providing support to partner countries like Ukraine and Georgia to help strengthen and reform their national defense institutions and improve their ability to work with NATO."
"Everything the United States is doing, both on its own and with NATO, will ensure that we continue to stand up to Russian aggression, and that we’re ready for longer-term competition.  "
"But it’s also necessary to keep the door open to working with Russia, where and when our interests align.  And as I said, there was a time, in the years after the Cold War, when Russia cooperated with the United States and other nations, contributing to the principled international order rather than undermining it.  I remember that personally – and so do many of you.  And perhaps someday, we’ll see that spirit rekindled."
"Next, I want to discuss what we’re doing as part of President Obama’s rebalance to the Asia-Pacific.  It will ensure DoD continues to help provide the security necessary for that consequential region – which is home to nearly half the global population and nearly half the global economy – to remain a place where everyone can rise and prosper for decades to come."
"That’s been American policy and practice since the end of World War II more than 70 years ago.  Regardless of what else was going on at home or in other parts of the world – during Democratic and Republican administrations, in times of surplus and deficit, war and peace – the United States has remained economically, politically, and militarily engaged in the Asia-Pacific."
"Now, unlike elsewhere in the world, peace and stability there has never been managed by a region-wide, formal structure like NATO in Europe.  That’s made sense because of the Asia-Pacific’s unique history, geography, and politics.  Instead, the United States has long taken a principled and inclusive approach, and collaborated with a network of regional allies and partners to enable security and uphold important principles like resolving disputes peacefully; ensuring countries can make choices free from external coercion and intimidation; and preserving the freedom of overflight and navigation guaranteed by international law. "
"Because we did so, out of the rubble of World War II, economic miracle after miracle occurred.  Think about it – first Japan, then Taiwan, South Korea, and Southeast Asia, and now, today, China, India, and others rose and prospered.  That progress has produced incredible changes in the region:  populations are growing, education has improved, freedom and self-determination have spread, economies have grown more interconnected, and military spending and cooperation are both increasing.

"Amid all this remarkable change and progress, America’s interests and objectives in the Asia-Pacific have endured: we still want peace, stability, and progress there for all, including ourselves.  But as the region has changed, our approach to how we meet those interests and uphold those enduring principles has had to change along with it.  "
"Today, as the Defense Department has been operationalizing one phase after another of the military part of the rebalance, we’re not only ensuring we remain the strongest military and primary provider of regional security; we’re also connecting – and further networking – our allies and partners in a burgeoning Principled and Inclusive Security Network that will allow all of us to see more, share more, and do more to maintain security in the region.  "
"In the rebalance’s first phase, which began five years ago, DoD sought to make our regional posture more robust – both on our own part and with allies and partners – geographically distributed, operationally resilient, and politically sustainable.  To do so, DoD sent tens of thousands of additional American personnel to the region, committed to homeporting 60 percent of our naval and overseas air assets in the Asia-Pacific, and began to modernize our regional posture around Guam as a strategic hub."
"In the second phase, which we launched last year, we committed to sending some of our best people and our most advanced capabilities – our newest submarines, our newest aircraft, and our newest surface warfare vessels to the Asia-Pacific.  "
"We also developed new and innovative strategies and operational concepts, and put them to use in more complex and expansive training exercises – both on our own and with our allies and partners – none larger than this summer’s RIMPAC."
"We’ve significantly strengthened our bilateral alliances and partnerships.  Nurtured over decades, tested in crisis, and built on shared interests, values, and sacrifice, we’ve now strengthened these relationships so they better reflect 21st century security needs.  There are so many examples to point to in the region – whether it’s our long-time alliances with the Republic of Korea and Australia, or our newer partnerships like those we’re growing with Singapore and Vietnam – but for time’s sake, I’ll focus on the two I’m leaving tomorrow to visit:  namely, Japan and India."
"The U.S.-Japan alliance remains the cornerstone of Asia-Pacific security.  And with their new Defense Guidelines, the U.S.-Japan alliance has never been stronger, or more capable of contributing to security in the Asia-Pacific and also beyond."
"Likewise, the U.S.-India defense relationship is the closest it’s ever been.  Through our strategic handshake – with America reaching west in the rebalance, and India reaching east in what Prime Minister Modi calls his Act East policy – our two nations are exercising together by air, land, and sea like never before.  And we also have a technological handshake – as the U.S.-India Defense Technology and Trade Initiative, or DTTI, grasps hands with Prime Minister Modi’s Make in India campaign – that’s helping our countries move towards a more diverse co-development and co-production system for developing and procuring weaponss. "
"Now, in the third phase of the rebalance, it will be necessary to cement the progress we’ve made in the first and second phases, and more importantly, build upon it. "
"The United States will continue to sharpen our military edge so we remain the most powerful military in the region, and the security partner of choice, by increasing and targeting investments in capabilities suited to the region to ensure we stay the best there.  More on that momentarily."
"We’ll also continue to make “leap-ahead” technological investments – including some surprising ones – that will help keep us in the lead in the Asia-Pacific, and elsewhere. "
"And we’ll further catalyze the Asia-Pacific’s growing Principled and Inclusive Security Network.  Although it’s not a formal alliance – as I said – like NATO, this burgeoning network is grounded in those principles I mentioned earlier.  It’s inclusive since any nation and any military – no matter its capability, budget, or experience – can contribute.  And it’s developing in several ways. "
"Trilateral mechanisms are bringing together trios of allies and partners that previously worked together – and the historical reasons for this are deep – only bilaterally.  For example, the blossoming U.S.-Japan-Republic of Korea trilateral partnership helps us coordinate responses to North Korean nuclear and missile provocations.  Just last month, our three countries held their second-ever trilateral ballistic missile warning exercise. "
"Next, and beyond relationships involving the United States, many countries within the Asia-Pacific are coming together on their own by establishing bilateral and trilateral mechanisms.  For example, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines are coordinating trilateral maritime patrols to counter piracy, organized crime, and terrorist activity in Southeast Asia.  That’s a good thing on its own, but it’s also an important step for this developing network."
"And even more broadly, Asia-Pacific nations are developing a networked, multilateral regional security architecture – from one end of the region to the other – as with, a central example, the ASEAN Defense Ministers Meeting-Plus serving as an important forum.  "
"That’s all to the good for the region and the United States, but it’s important to remember, the rebalance and this Asia-Pacific security network are not aimed at any particular country.  The network’s not closed and excludes no one.  Although we have disagreements with China, including over its destabilizing behavior in the South China Sea, and its behavior is in fact driving many to work more closely with us, we’re committed to working with China where possible, to introducing measures to reduce risk, and to encouraging them to avoid self-isolation."
"All this is happening today.  But even as we confront today’s challenges of this strategic time of transition, it will also be necessary for DoD to lead and compete well into the future.  "
"Today’s is the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  There’s no other military that’s stronger, more capable, more experienced, or frankly, or more innovative.  But that’s not a birthright, and it’s not guaranteed.  We can’t take it for granted in the 21st century.  We have to earn it again and again."
"To do so, we have to invest and innovate for the uncertain future we face.  And that’s why I’ve been constantly pushing the Pentagon to think outside of our five-sided-box to ensure our technology, our plans, our organization, and above all, our people – we stay the best for decades to come."
"Our most recent budget proposal – which I continue to strongly urge appropriators in Congress to pass, as soon as possible – is designed to make sure DoD maintains our dominance in every domain.  We’re growing not only the number of ships in the fleet, but also their lethality – with new weapons like the dual-capable SM-6 missile – and we’re extending our commanding lead – commanding lead in undersea warfare.  We’re investing in our air superiority and global reach, including through advanced munitions and payloads of all kinds, and also innovative capabilities and new platforms – some more typical, like the F-35 Lightning joint strike fighter, the B-21 long-range strike bomber, and the KC-[4]6 tanker – and some less so, like swarming micro-drones, the arsenal plane, and others.  And those are just the things we can talk about here.  Meanwhile, we’re also prioritizing full-spectrum training and readiness for our ground forces.   As I mentioned earlier, we’re reversing decades of underinvestment in our nuclear deterrent, and recapitalizing it.  And we’re doing more in cyber, electronic warfare, and space to make sure we stay on the cutting edge."
"In addition to those investments, we’re pushing the envelope with research and development to stay ahead of our competitors and at technology’s frontier, by putting nearly $72 billion dollars into R&D this next year.  To give you a little context, that’s more than double what Apple, Intel, and Google spent on R&D last year combined."
"Beyond that, we’ve been building and rebuilding bridges between the Pentagon and America’s technology community.  One way we’re doing so is through our Defense Innovation Unit-Experimental, or DIUx – which I created to help connect with startups and other commercial tech firms in Silicon Valley, Boston, Austin, Texas, and everywhere in between.  And thanks to Raj Shah – and Raj, I don’t know if you’re here today.  Where are you?  There he is.  Raj Shah right there – DIUx’s managing director who’s participating in this forum, those outposts are already producing results: DIUx has interacted with companies in 31 states to help us adopt technologies more quickly that can help our warfighters accomplish their missions.  We will always need our traditional defense partners to help us build our planes, tanks, and ships, but DIUx will better connect the Pentagon to a whole new world of American innovation.  And help our own countries find new technologies and new people to bring into them.  All that’s an investment worth making."
"We’re also innovating operationally.  Our core contingency plans are constantly being changed to apply innovation to our operational approaches – including ways to overcome emerging threats, such as anti-satellite weapons or hybrid warfare.  We’re also building in modularity, planning in new ways for overlapping contingencies, and injecting agility and flexibility into our war plans."
"Meanwhile we’re making reforms across the DoD enterprise –streamlining our headquarters operations, lowering our health care costs, and more.  We’re also continuing to support and seek improvements in the spirit of Goldwater-Nichols to, among other changes, clarify the role and authority of the Chairman, the Joint Chiefs, and the Joint Staff, and to help our Combatant Commands be more efficient and agile and support me and the President, especially in the face of transregional and transfunctional challenges.  "
"We’re also building on the success of our Better Buying Power initiative, which has helped reduce the growth of contracted costs for major acquisition programs – very significant.  To improve on this progress, it will be necessary to make additional changes to defense acquisition process, like streamlining the system itself, we proposed them.   "
"And we’re ensuring DoD’s a place where thinking boldly and differently, which is long a strength of America, is fostered.  One way we’re doing so is with the Defense Innovation Board I established earlier this year, chaired by Google-Alphabet’s Eric Schmidt.  Its members are already making a mark.  One of their recommendations and on their recommendation, we’re creating a Chief Innovation Officer to act as a senior advisor to the Secretary of Defense and serve as a spearhead for innovation activities, such as building software platforms and human networks to enable workforce-driven innovation across DoD."
"And lastly, we’re building what I call the Force of the Future – to ensure that amid generational, technological, and labor market changes, we continue to attract and retain and develop the most talented people America has to offer.  "
"In total, the Force of the Future initiatives span the career of a uniformed servicemember or DoD civilian – from recruiting men and women to join, to caring for, retaining, and developing them, and then to helping successfully transition those who want to move on.  And these initiatives include reinvigorating and expanding the geographic reach of our Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program, which marks its 100th year this year; making common-sense improvements to military talent management and officer promotion; giving components the authority to directly hire civilians on college campuses; and recognizing survey data indicating the importance of family life to retention – after all, bear in mind that our force is largely a married force – by expanding maternity and paternity leave and extending on-base childcare hours, among other steps."
"To demonstrate the logic of what we’re doing, let me tell you a bit more about one way we’re helping to build the Force of the Future.  "
"As some of you may know, today is the one-year anniversary of my decision to open all combat positions to women.  I made that decision so we can benefit from the talents of every American who can meet our high standards and contribute to our mission.  In the 21st century, and in an all-volunteer force, that requires us to be able to draw from the broadest possible pool of people who can meet our stringent and uncompromising standards."
"That pool must include women, because they make up more than 50 percent of our population.  That’s mission critical."
"I directed that there be no quotas, and that is why the number of women in the previously-closed specialties may be modest.  But they will be the best talent for the job.  And even for women who don’t choose these specialties, the fact that they are open means any woman in uniform will be measured by her contribution to the force no matter what career field she chooses.  "
"In conclusion, all of the actions and decisions I’ve spelled out today were taken to do exactly what my predecessors did for me: ensure that my successor and my successors’ successors will inherit as fine a fighting force as the one I’m privileged to lead today.  Maintaining that continuity is our tradition in the Department of Defense, and one I’ve always been determined to uphold.  "
"As I mentioned, I depart tomorrow on a two-week trip to visit our American personnel serving in the Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, and Europe.  My wife Stephanie and I are looking forward to thanking them and their families, and wishing them all a happy holiday season from their Commander-in-Chief, and their leadership, and their country, and I’m sure from all of you. "
"I’d ask all of you during this holiday season to help our fellow Americans to understand and appreciate what those troops are doing for them.  Each and every one is ensuring we continue to meet the challenges we face, defend our country, and make a better world – not just in this strategic transition, but well into the future. "
"And we’re able to do so – and to bring unrivaled strength to those missions – because of the work, contributions, and ideas of people, supporters, and leaders like those in this room.  We can do so because of the decisions and leadership of presidents, defense secretaries, and senators and congressmen of both parties over decades.  And most importantly, we can do so because of the service and sacrifice of our people – every soldier, sailor, airmen, and Marine – and their families.  "
"I know that our mission is demanding and constantly changing, but I couldn’t be prouder of them for what they do every day – and for all they’ve done for all of us.  And I’m sure all of you feel the same."
"Today President Donald J. Trump sent Congress a proposed budget request of $639.1 billion, $574.5 billion in the base budget and $64.6 billion in the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) budget.  This budget request is $52 billion above the defense budget cap in the Budget and Control Act (BCA) of 2011."
"This funding is required to continue to rebuild warfighting readiness and will restore program balance by fixing the holes created by previous budget cuts.  Since enactment of the BCA, the world has become more dangerous. Over this period, the military has become smaller and training, maintenance, and modernization have been deferred, resulting in degraded warfighting readiness.  This budget request reverses that degradation and starts restoring the readiness of our armed forces to meet the challenges of today and the future.  To do so, it is essential that the defense sequestration caps be reversed.  As Secretary Mattis recently told members of Congress, the BCA and sequestration have “done more damage to our readiness than the enemies in the field.”"
"The funding in the OCO budget provides resources in support of Operation Freedom’s Sentinel (OFS) in Afghanistan, Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) in Iraq and Syria and other global counterterrorism operations.  In addition, the funds enhance U.S. assurance and deterrence in Eastern Europe through the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI)."
The FY 2018 budget request is the second step in a three-step process to rebuild the Armed Forces.  The first step was the FY 2017 Appropriations Act.  That money is for immediate warfighting readiness shortfalls and funds the increased operating tempo in the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).  This request builds on those resources and focuses on restoring a balanced defense program.
The FY 2018 budget request includes:
This budget request also invests in modernization and advanced capabilities to reassert our technological edge over future adversaries.  Major investments include:
The military and civilian personnel are the foundation of the Department and constitute its premier asset.  They have the full support of the Nation to accomplish the arduous mission of defending the United States of America.  This budget includes a 2.1% pay raise for military personnel and a 1.9% pay raise for civilian personnel. The budget supports a competitive compensation package that reflects the unique demands and sacrifices of our service members.  The Department continues to seek compensation reforms that will:
"The Department continues to support a wide range of family support programs, such as:"
"The FY 2018 budget request also continues the broad institutional reform agenda, which will:"
o   Establish a chief technology officer
o   Establish a chief acquisition and sustainment officer
"The third step is the approval of the FY 2019 budget (and beyond).  This budget will be the first budget informed by the new National Defense Strategy that the Department is currently developing.  With that strategy in hand, the Department will be able to determine the budget needed to rebuild capacity and lethality across the Joint Force."

"      And in the centuries that followed its birth, it showcased vital elements of our military power, from civil iron-clads and World War I and II battleships built in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, to the service members, ships and airplanes that fill New York's streets, seaports and skies each Fleet Week."
"Over the years and moments of triumph and tragedy alike, whether ticker-tape parades honoring generals, admirals, astronauts and veterans or the fall of the Twin Towers on 9/11, this city has been etched into the collective heart and the collective memory of our country and those who defend it."
"Given this history, it's no surprise that many New Yorkers have contributed to the security of this country, including students of CCNY.  Such as Colin Powell, who was a cadet here in the Army's Reserve Officer Training Corps, or ROTC, which celebrates its 110th birthday this year, a reason why I'm here.  And Colin rose to be chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff."
"      Bob Kahn, who co-invented the internet while working at our Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA.  And also, the ROTC cadets here today from across the City University of New York will soon be joining the finest fighting force the world has ever known."
"      We have that force today because of people.  More than anything else, they're the reason why we're the best.  But we can't take that excellence for granted.  And as generations change and technologies change, labor markets change, it's my job as secretary of Defense to build what I call the Force of the Future, to ensure that we keep competing for top talent in the years ahead to build a force that's just as excellent as the men and women serving our country around the world today."
      And that's why I've come to CCNY this morning.
      
"      America has a lot of strengths and our future's very bright.  Our economy's growing, we have world-class universities like this one and we also have the strongest military.  But another strength we have is all of the students here.  That generation is incredibly talented.  It's diverse, it's innovative, it's tech-friendly.  Many of you are interested in public service, whether it's in government, schools, non-profits or volunteering in your community."
"      But one opportunity that many CCNY students, including some of you, may not have considered is serving our country by serving in the military, and that's what I want to talk to you about today, how we're not only making military service more attractive but also a place where you can maximize your talent and skills while doing one of the noblest things a person can do; defend our country and leave a better world for our children."
"      Shortly after I was sworn in as secretary of Defense, I went to my old high school in Pennsylvania to outline this vision of the Force of the Future.  I told the students there how we in the Pentagon have to think outside of our five-sided box to make ourselves even better at attracting talent from new generations of Americans."
"In the months that followed, I traveled the country, hearing from companies like LinkedIn and Facebook and Boeing and more, and also from our own innovative troops and military leaders about what they're all doing to compete for talent in the 21st century and what we can learn from them to improve our own talent management."
"      And over the last year, we've done a lot.  I've announced four different links to this Force of the Future, and that's just the beginning.  Each of these are constantly being updated and they’re our agenda for making sure that we have -- continue to have the finest fighting force."
"      I announced the first link a year ago this month, creating what I called at that time on-ramps -- new on-ramps and new off-ramps.  New on-ramps so more people outside of DOD can come in for a while and contribute to our mission.  Maybe just for one project, maybe just for a time.  And new off-ramps so more people who are in our military can spend some time at a leading university or a leading company to gain skills that they can bring back into our force, make us better."
"      The next link focused on increasing retention by supporting military families at the critical time of their life where they've proven their worth to us.  We've invested heavily in -- in them, and that's the time in which many of them are thinking about having a family.  And this may not be top of mind for many of CCNY students yet, but you should know that the majority of our force is married and families are a big factor when our people decide whether to stick with us or not.  "
"      We can't change the fundamentals of military service, but wherever possible, we want to make it easier for our best people to stay.  So we've expanded maternity and paternity leave, extended childcare hours on base and we're offering more military families the possibility of staying in the community where they're stationed a bit longer before being reassigned in exchange for a few more years of service."
"      The third link focused on military talent management, especially for officers and how they're promoted.  As some of you may know, our traditions and our systems go back a long way, and it's a good thing.  But because how we do this hasn't changed much in a long time, in some ways, it's become too rigid, most importantly for the needs of our military leaders, but also for the career aspirations of our service members."
"      So we're making it possible to infuse some more flexibility in choice, continuing to make sure that our merit-based promotion system accounts for performance and talent as much as possible."
"And most recently, link number four to the Force of the Future focused on civilian talent management.  You may not know, while we have over two million service members in uniform, we also have 700,000 civilians.  These are people who fix our planes, build our ships, staff our wonderful scientific laboratories and more."
"      And not everyone will choose to serve in uniform and we have critical jobs for people and civilians.  There may be some in this room that find and apply for them. By directly hiring civilians on college campuses, which we're now able to do -- just made that change -- without the long waits for a job offer that make it near impossible for us to be their first choice as well as by expanding scholarship for service programs in science and technology fields and more."
"In addition to all these links, over the last year we also opened all combat positions in all four military services to women.  And we also lifted DOD's ban on transgender service members.  All with a goal of being able to draw from 100 percent of America's population for our all-volunteer force.  Focusing purely on a person's willingness and ability to serve our country and contribute to our mission."
      And we've doubled down on our pledge to help our service members transition to veteran status when they move on to whatever's next for them in life so that they can succeed in every way possible.  All this is necessary to help us compete for top talent in the future.  But it's not sufficient.
"Today our military and our troops are popular and they're widely supported by the American people.  And I very much appreciate that, because I remember a time when it was different.  But because of all the success of the all-volunteer force it is because we don't use a draft anymore, we haven't for 40 years.  Many Americans have become less familiar with us.  Indeed in surveys and focus groups we run, almost half of young Americans tell us they have little or no knowledge about military service.  And this may be related to trends we've been seeing recently in military recruiting both in terms of where our recruits come from and also where their parents served -- whether their parents served."
"Geographically first, our military's recruiting pool is shrinking.  More and more of our people coming from fewer and fewer states.  Today, young Americans from rural areas are two times more likely to join the military than young Americans from urban areas.  And 40 percent of those who join the military come from just six states, including New York.  Most of our officers come from northern states while the vast majority of our enlisted force comes from southern states."
"      At the moment military recruiting tends to be most successful in the South, the Southwest, big sky country, and most difficult in the Northeast.  And that's paradoxical since the Northeast is among the regions with the highest percentage of young Americans who have the qualifications to serve."
"      So these geographic gaps represent an opportunity -- a great opportunity for us to draw talent from places where we haven't been.  Same time, the military is also starting to resemble something of a family business as those with a parent who served in uniform are almost twice as likely to join the military as those whose didn't."
"      Now to be clear, that's not necessarily a bad thing.  Following in the footsteps of one parent -- one's parents or grandparents is a long and noble tradition in the military.  And here it may be happening because people are having positive experiences in the military and their kids see it as something that may be good for them, too.  And all that's good, but it also means that there are talented kids out there who would make great service members, but they don't have a parent showing them this opportunity.  Consider that in terms of pure numbers.  Consider that less than one percent of America's population serves in uniform."
"      From my generation and my parent's generation, three in four family members served in the military.  For your generation it's one in three.  So, unless someone has a friend or a family member who's serving, they are most likely to see our military movies like ""American Sniper,"" or video games like ""Call of Duty,"" or TV commercials featuring wounded warriors or troops coming home.  And while all these images are somewhat true, they're only a slice of our military's jobs, lives and stories, which in reality are as impressive, and as varied as more than two million men and women serving in uniform today."
"Over the last decade or so, this has even contributed to new misconceptions and stereotypes about military life among younger Americans.  For example, some tell us they think military life is incompatible with having a family, when the truth is, 52 percent of our enlisted force is married, and 70 percent of our office corps -- officer corps is married.  These are both much greater percentages than in the population as a whole."
"Some people even told us they think there's a penalty in the military for getting pregnant.  It's not only false; in fact, we now offer 12 weeks paid maternity leave for a new mother serving in uniform.  Also, polls are show that young Americans today are 30 percent less likely than they were 10 years ago to think joining the military would let them earn money for college, yet the reality is the exact opposite.  And that -- and that -- during that very time, 10 years, the G.I. Bill has helped over 2.3 million veterans pay for college, and 120,000 have benefited from ROTC scholarships."
"      And less than half of young Americans today -- survey show -- think that the active duty military has people like them in it, despite the fact that we have people from all walks of life in our ranks.  And no matter who you are, who you love, who look like, or where your parents came from, if you're able and willing to serve, and meet our high standards, we give you a full and equal opportunity to do so."
"      The bottom line is, that because we too often talk about sacrifice alone, which is no small thing, we probably don't spend enough time highlighting the opportunities that exist, and the fulfillment one has from achieving excellence and doing the service of your country."
"      No one should gloss over the hardships or dangers of military life.  But our service members would be among the first to tell you how proud they feel to wear a uniform; how much they've learned and grown, and how it feels to wake up every morning to contribute something to bigger -- bigger than yourself."
"      We're going to ensure we keep recruiting top talent in future generations.  We want to puncture these stereotypes and help our fellow citizens get to know today's military for what it really is, even if they don't have a parent, or neighbor, or coach, or a friends who served.  And in terms of where and how we recruit, we'll be missing an opportunity, if we kept fishing in only the same geographic ponds we are now.  We need to seize that opportunity by fishing in more ponds, new ponds, ponds we haven't been in, in a long time.  We have to draw talent from our country's entire pool of population for our all volunteer force."
"      The first step is identifying the importance of this effort, and this a big reason why I came here to give this speech, where I speak about this all the time, all the while we're engaged around the world, protecting our country and confronting our enemies.  Nevertheless, never take my eye off this, because if we're going to help an entire generation better understand who we are and what we're about, one speech isn't enough."
"      It requires a comprehensive effort across the department, and this is our focus.  Let me take a few minute to tell you -- tell you what we're planning to do.  And these are new things."
"      First, we're going to start communicating better how, or the value of military life, telling our story in more places, more ways and to a broader range of audiences across the country.  Well, we plan to do through that through several different avenues, I want to tell you about a few."
"      First, we're going to change how we highlight our mission through advertising.  There's a long history of advertising for military service from the century old, I want you posters of Uncle Sam, to the commercials you see on primetime and network TV.  These ad campaigns are meant to get potential recruits to sign up so that the military services can meet the recruiting needs.  They get people in the door and help the services build a brand that sets them apart from others.  And all that's good, but they sometimes highlight only a narrow slice of the institution and people who defend this country every day."
"Although the Defense Department used to advertise the value of military life as a whole, we got away from that over the last several years.  In some ways, we're a victim of our success with so many people signing up after 9/11 and the Great Recession.  Now we're getting back into it.  I mean we're starting to advertise the value of military life and public service again in the service's recruiting ads."
"      In doing so, we're going to reach out and talk to American people wherever they are.  Which as you know, isn't just on TV anymore but increasingly in different places online.  And we won't just speak to potential recruits, we're going to speak to everyone, including parents, grandparents, coaches, teachers, guidance counselors and more who might influence a potential recruit.  To truly have an affect, this has to be done in a sustained way and over a long period of time."
"      We won't be selling the newest phones or trying to get you signed up for the newest credit card.  Ultimately what we're selling is service and mission, a chance to be part, as I said, of something bigger than yourself that will not only do something good for you, but that you serve others.  And then after you've served, go on to do something great with the rest of your life like so many of our veterans do."
"      Now since advertising can't fully substitute for personal inspiration to contact, we're also going to create a DOD speaker's bureau of senior leaders and experts from across our military and defense department dedicated to help educating key audiences.  Schools, parents, teachers, principles, coaches, career counselors, civic groups, cultural groups, youth groups, companies and more on the value and benefits of military public service in support of our mission of national defense."
"      And I'm the first speaker to sign up and I'm kicking that off right here, today.  In addition, we're going to try to better leverage our most successful outreach programs and also help -- that already help people give back to America's communities."
"      One example is called Starbase, where our service members volunteer in local elementary schools and help inspire kids to explore and learn more about science, technology, engineering and math.  And that allows us to help them but also allows those little kids to get to know us in a hands-on way, and we want to have more of that opportunity in both directions."
"      Similarly, we're also going to do some important new things to help each of the services improve their recruiting efforts to increase our access geographically, demographically and generationally."
"      For example, I've heard from some of our recruiters that some high schools aren't giving them the access they feel they need to be able to do their jobs.  Now the law requires schools to give our recruiters a basic level of access, and while it seems many schools are complying with that, recognizing the DOD might offer their students an exciting and impactful careers, some others are putting up roadblocks.  This is wrong."
"      So as part of a new program to help recruiters, we're gonna survey them and identify where exactly they face impediments to access and what the most useful types of access actually are so we can educate those educators who may not be complying with the law or who may be making life harder on their students and recruiters and find a way to improve that."
      Our goal here is to better educate schools about our mission and help them realize they should want to let us in because it'd be a missed opportunity for their students if they don't.
"      Our services are also gonna be experimenting with having their recruiters be more mobile, leveraging technologies so they can recruit across a wider geographic areas.  And they'll also review some of the benchmarks kids currently have to meet in order to join the military. "
"      When I was in Boston earlier this year, I sat down with some of our fantastic enlisted recruiters from all over the Northeast.  And they told me some of the challenges they were facing with spectacular potential recruits who nevertheless also reflect the times in relation to such benchmarks as their current physical fitness, tattoos they got when they were younger, single parenthood and the like."
"      Now, some of these things we'll never be able to compromise on.  We'll always have to maintain high standards.  At the same time, these benchmarks must be kept relevant for both today's force and tomorrow's, meaning we have to ensure that they're not unnecessarily restrictive.  So we're gonna review and update these standards as appropriate."
"      And this brings me to another way we bring talented people into the military.  In fact, right here, right now.  And that's through our Reserve Officer Training Corps program, ROTC, located on campuses around the country.  Forty percent of our officers come from ROTC.  It's also a key part of helping those who may not have been exposed to us before getting to know us."
"This is ROTC's 100th anniversary and because DOD's a learning organization and we're always trying to improve, it stands to reason that we should use this anniversary to examine ROTC.  How can we make it even better?  And that's what our sixth link to the Force of the Future's all about, preparing ROTC for another 100 years of success."
"There's no question that ROTC's had its ups and downs over the last century.  But today, it's a very successful program, and CCNY is proof of that.  CCNY enrolled its first Army ROTC student in 1917, 99 years ago, the first year of the program, making it one of the first programs in the whole country.  And it was subsequently a mainstay ROTC school until 1971, when the faculty senate voted to cut ties with the military to protest the Vietnam War, as many other colleges and universities did at the time."
"ROTC didn't return until after Don't Ask, Don't Tell was repealed a few years ago, which allowed gay and lesbian Americans to serve openly.  And since ROTC came back to CCNY in 2013, cadets graduating from here have gone on to assignments in exciting fields, like cyber and military intelligence.  Serve all places all around the world; South Korea, Japan, Middle East."
"      Now, we want to make sure that these detachments are able to thrive, help more people on these campuses to get to know us, and thereby help us attract talent to contribute to our mission.  We plan to do this by focusing on those who participate in ROTC and those who lead it and on the program overall."
"      Now, to make sure ROTC keeps attracting great participants like Cadet Reynolds, your instructors here also will be offering more graduate school scholarships especially for law school and medical school for students who are college seniors."
"      We'll also offer more two and three year ROTC scholarships, which will make it easier for someone who maybe didn't know about ROTC at first, but will be able to participate nevertheless and serve if they learn about it maybe from a roommate or a teammate or a classmate once they get to campus."
"      We're going to sponsor more high school students interested in science, technology, engineering and math to shadow ROTC cadets at schools that specialize in those fields to help them open their eyes to how ROTC's worth a try, and to reward cadets that challenge themselves academically."
"      For example, if they choose a more rigorous academic major and deliberately seek out harder courses, we plan to make it possible for them to get credit for that when they commission.  Specifically in how their service generates what we call the branching and assignment order or merit list, which basically means giving them a greater choice in what they'll do in the military."
"      Next, turning to those who instruct ROTC cadets because so many of our officers come from ROTC units, we want them to be taught by our very best.  Just like you want the best professors and you all check out your evaluations on ratemyprofessor.com, we're the same.  And the thing is often in the military, just as with teachers in our society general, generally the job of being a ROTC instructor isn't always treated as importantly as it should be.  We have educators here, I've been an educator myself."
"      For instance, some officers determining their next assignment may have to choose between a ROTC instructor or accepting a command slot that would get them promoted sooner.  This can make the job less appealing to those that want to advance up the ranks, making some good officers who want to make yet more good officers unable to choose to do this."
"      And now, that's -- fortunately, that's not always the case.  My senior military assistant, Brigadier General Eric Smith -- Eric, where are you? - who's here today, right back there.  Eric, my senior military assistant in the office of the Secretary of Defense, instructed future Marine officers and the Navy ROTC program at Texas A&M.  And he'll tell you it was fantastic."
"      So, did our chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joe Dunford.  He was a Marine officer instructor at Holy Cross in Massachusetts for three years.  The first ever chairman, by the way, to have ever done so.  And that not only gave critical insights into the generation of the officers that he would lead in the future, but it also helped him build closer ties between us and that community.  Teaching leadership on a college campus is something DOD should reward.  And we need to encourage and make it easier for our best people to do so."
      And that's why I've directed the military services to ensure that their officer promotion and selection boards were appropriately value those who serve as ROTC instructors.  We're also going to set up a pipeline for officers did ROTC themselves to give back to the program and be instructors later in their careers.
"      Lastly, in terms of the ROTC program as a whole, we want it to be continuously improving nationwide with units and schools across the country sharing best practices and good ideas that might work for others.  Right now we don't have a way to know which units are doing great things that others might want to consider adopting."
"      In part, because we have so many programs all over the country.  More, by the way, than at the end of the Vietnam War."
"      So, we're going to develop data-driven ways to accurately measure and assess which ROTC units are most effective in performing their mission, and we're gonna look at much more than just how many officers they commission each year because quality and training and innovative ideas and things like reaching back into the local community and strengthening connections with the school are important, too."
"      ROTC units that stand out the most each year will be eligible for a new reward recognizing their excellence, the Secretary of Defense ROTC Futures Award.  And I challenge CCNY to be among the first to get it."
"      Now, I want to be clear that for all we've done over the last year, including the plans I've laid out today, building the Force of the Future isn't going to happen overnight.  It's going to be a generational effort and this is just the beginning, because our goal is to address challenges and seize opportunities that have arisen over years and decades and we have to sustain and build on this over the years and decades ahead as well."
"      I'm confident we can because for the first time in a long time, the parts of the Pentagon that handle the health, the welfare, the readiness and the talent management of our people across the entire lifetime of their service have a clear roadmap for where they're going and what they're gonna do in the years ahead."
"      And we'll keep innovating as we learn more, do more and as society and technology change.  After all, we want people to consider military and public service because when it comes to working in national security, no matter what they do, military or civilian, they'll be better off for having been part of this incredible mission."
"      And that's true for all of you as well, whether it's the people, the skills or the experiences.  Nothing else compares to it, I guarantee it."
"      You know, it's been said that security is like oxygen.  When you have it, you don't think about it, but when you don't have it, it's all you ever think about."
"      The men and women who serve in our military provide that security, that oxygen not only to Americans, but to many all over the world who still depend on us for their oxygen, too.  That allows millions of Americans and millions of our friends and allies to get up in the morning and to go to work, to go to schools like CCNY, to live their lives and dream their dreams and give their children a better future."
      That is one of the noblest things a person can do and there's no other feeling like waking up every morning and knowing you're contributing to that mission.
"      While I don't expect all of you to join us, I do ask you to give it some thought and to give encouragement when a friend or a sibling, maybe even one day a child of yours might decide to do so.  Wouldn't even be surprised if it's a future secretary of defense sitting here or somewhere on this campus at CCNY today or a future chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff sitting among the ROTC cadets here."
"      But I'm also confident that you all have something to contribute, a drive to be something -- part of something bigger than yourself.  And that's where the call to service begins.  And that's the beginning of how we'll make a better and a brighter world together."
      Thank you for having me here today.
      (APPLAUSE)
"STAFF:  We will now transition to question and answers.  We have about 10 minutes, unfortunately."
"      The first two questions will come from our student moderators.  First from Etienne Forbes, a four-year Navy veteran.  He is now a CCNY student and a Colin Powell fellow studying organizational psychology.  And then Cadet Christina Androtti, a Baruch student studying human resource management.  Also a New York National Guard member who helped guard JFK Airport following the Chelsea bombings."
"      So please, Etienne."
"      Q:  Thank you.  First, I want to thank you first for the efforts made toward improving the family efforts in the military because I still got to see firsthand how it affects the mission day to day.  So can't wait to hear from my fellows still serving how it affects them."
      SEC. CARTER:  Good.
"      Q:  My question is on a different tack.  Actually, there was a New York Times article last week highlighting some of the efforts the Department of Defense is making towards artificial intelligence in war fighting.  So, some of the fears mentioned, destabilizing affect it could have if some nations or non-nation actors get these technology."
"      So, how does the DOD move forward with developing the artificial intelligence amid the concerns that other countries and other -- have less restrictive policies ethically with it?"
"      SEC. CARTER:  Well, that's a good question.  And we, of course, have long made sure that our military is at the technological frontiers in the world.  The internet arose from us, the integrated circuit.  If you go back further, jet engines.  And it's important that the Department of Defense pioneer these technologies, artificial intelligence is one of those and there's no question about it."
"      And there are questions that arise in the application of artificial intelligence, as there are in all areas of warfare, about how it can be used appropriately and ethically and also how we protect ourselves from those who would use it in a destructive and evil way."
"      With respect to the first part, I think, Etienne, you're getting at the question of if -- when here's artificial intelligence or autonomous systems, you get this idea that they're going to be weapons of war out there that nobody's controlling.  That's not the way we do things.  We will always have a human being in the loop -- a human being making decisions about the use of force on behalf of the United States."
"      When it comes to defending ourselves against others who might use the same technologies, that is why it's important for us to be at the frontier.  So we can see those problems first and we prepare our defenses and our resilience against them so we can continue to protect our people and more generally protect society against them.  And we are doing that in the case of artificial intelligence and autonomy.  So, I think the article you read was very accurate in that regard, but it's important that in matters we're entrusted with the use of force on behalf of our people and our values.  And it's important that we take our values with us to the battlefield, and we do."
"      And that's why you see, for example, in the campaign that's going on right now every day to destroy ISIL in Iraq, Syria, wherever it springs up around the world.  We are exceptionally careful in our use of force.  And if you compare us to others who are doing their campaigns around the world -- for example, in Syria, you can see that we're very serious about taking American values to the battle front, we make no apologies about that.  We do that, that's who we are.  And we -- and we win the right way.  And of course, we're going to win."
"      Q:  Sir, first of all, thank you for coming out here and taking the time to come address us about these issues."
"      I want to take it in a little bit of a different direction.  As future commissioning officers and cadets in the ROTC program, you know, we're going to have many responsibilities with family, and jobs and the services.  I want to know how do you balance -- not only your personal life -- but as well as the many demands that come from the different services that you deal with."
"      SEC. CARTER:  Well, I'll start with myself.  The way I balance my personal life is right down there, is my wife, Stephanie, who by the way -- and this is important, is like me, and that she -- she loves the troops.  She loves our people who -- who do this mission.  They're who we wake up for every morning.  And it's important to have a partner in life, if you happen to get married or otherwise have a close partner in life, that they share your sense of excitement and dedication to what you're excited -- there's no substitute for that.  That goes back to how you choose that person in the first place, but it's incredibly important.  "
"      We try to support and nurture that as an institution.  Now, I've got to be clear, we have to do what we have to do.  We send people where we need them to protect our country.  We put them in harm's way when that is necessary; we take the utmost care in doing that.  I can't change any of that, that's the profession of arms.  However, within that frame, there's a lot we can do and that we are doing to help our service members reconcile, what's hard for any of us, but particularly hard given the realities of military life."
"So let me give you some examples.  We -- and I mentioned this in the case of childcare.  So, let's take a member who's been in service now for 10 years.  Around about that time, they've proven their worth to us, we've invested a lot in them, and that's right around the time -- and by the way, it's getting later and later in this generation, people decide to have a family, it's not as early as it used to be.  And so, then suddenly they say, I want to have a family, how am I going to do that in a way where they send me where they want to send me, when they send me?  Well, we're trying to find ways wherever we can to reconcile those things."
"      So for example, we're giving commanders the latitude to tell you, your kids have two more years in school.  You can stay at this base, we're not going to send you to this other base for a couple years.  Now, we want something back from you, just like we pay for scholarships for ROTC students, and we want something back from them, we want a commitment to serve us."
"      So we're willing to work with people in that way, and that's why, you know, I extended daycare hours on bases a few months ago.  May seem like a small thing, but it's not a small thing.  If you're a service member with kids, and the daycare center opens at the very moment you're supposed to be at work, how are you supposed to do that, all this juggling?"
"      Nursing rooms for mothers may seem like a small thing, it's not a small thing, it's a big deal.  It's not a big deal for us to do it, but it's a big deal -- all we have to do is think, and then we realize there are things we can do to help people."
"      So, I'm looking for ideas, we're constantly trying to do that, because we are a married force, as I said.  We are disproportionately -- relative to the rest of society -- an institution of married people and we've got to make what we have to do compatible with their aspirations to the extent we can.  But the best thing you can do is have somebody that loves what you do, and who loves the mission."
"      STAFF:  So we have just a few minutes remaining to open the floor for questions from students.  If you'd like to ask a question please come to the center microphone in the center aisle there.  A fair warning, the secretary is probably not going to address questions about the election or politics even though it is seven days away."
"      Q:  Hello.  Secretary, thank you for being here.  Thank you for taking questions.  My name's (inaudible).  I'm a political science major freshman.  "
"      I know given the disclaimer, my question has be a little bit revised, but we're coming to a big -- America is coming to make a big choice in the coming weeks and regardless of that outcome, how do you feel that your plan that you discussed here today will be able to be continued to be implemented?"
"      SEC. CARTER:  Sure.  It's a good question and let me just say why I follow that rule.  In this entire election campaign -- election season, I have -- in congressional testimony, public events, never, ever entered into the political debate.  That's an extremely important principle, and it's important that our institution stand aside from the political process and in particular, it's important that our uniform members do so."
"      And by my standing aside, I show them that they too can stand aside and not answer questions that are -- I just simply say, I'm sorry I'm not going to answer your question, because it's posed in that way.  So I just wanted to explain and you posed a more general question so that's fine."
"How do you know these -- that these things will continue into the future?  I'm confident they will, because they make so much sense and we've had -- I've known my 11, 12 predecessors of secretary of defense and they've all known that our people were central."
      They've all helped our institution adapt to the times and their own eras and their own generations so there's a logic here to what we're doing.  It makes sense for our military and I'm confident that logic will carry into the future.
      Q:  Thank you.
"Q:  Mr. Secretary, I'm 87-years-old, and as you can imagine, I have seen, as a colonel, lots of secretaries of defense.  I am absolutely amazed that you are our secretary of defense compared to all of the others I've ever seen over the years.  And I think we all owe you a thankful, from the bottom of our hearts, especially old ROTC guys who have made a life out of becoming ROTC officers."
"      I say thank to you, sir."
"      SEC. CARTER:  Thank you.  Thanks so much for saying that, I appreciate that.  Thank y'all very much."
      Thank you.  Thanks so much.
      STAFF:  I think that gave us the perfect way to end our session today.  So please join me again in thanking Secretary Carter for spending his busy day with us today.
"      SEC. CARTER:  Thank you all, very much."

"Thanks, Cadet Reynolds – and good morning, everybody."
"What a beautiful, spectacular place.  Thank you.  Thanks to CCNY for letting me be here this morning.  This is an institution that was founded to educate the sons and daughters of this great city of New York, a city which has given so much to our military over the years as well."
"It’s been home of some of the most iconic moments in our military history.  In the months after we declared independence in 1776, we learned here for the first time to fight together as a nation, at the battles of Brooklyn and Harlem Heights and Washington Heights. And in the centuries that followed its birth, it showcased vital elements of our military power – from Civil War iron-clads and World War I and II battleships built in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, to the servicemembers, ships and airplanes that fill New York’s streets, seaports and skies each Fleet Week. And over the years, in moments of triumph and tragedy alike – whether at ticker-tape parades honoring generals, admirals, astronauts, and veterans, or the fall of the Twin Towers on 9/11 – this city has been etched into the collective heart and the collective memory of our country and those who defend it."
"Given this history, it’s no surprise that many New Yorkers have contributed to the security of this country – including students of CCNY, such as, Colin Powell, who was a cadet here in the Army’s Reserve Officers’ Training Corps, or ROTC – which celebrates its 100th birthday this year, one reason why I’m here – and Colin rose to become Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Bob Kahn, who co-invented the Internet while working at our Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA; and also the ROTC cadets here today, from across the City University of New York, who will soon be joining the finest fighting force the world has ever known."
"We have that force today because of our people. More than anything else, they’re the reason why we’re the best.  But we can’t take that excellence for granted.  And as generations change, and technologies change, labor markets change, it’s my job as Secretary of Defense to build what I call our Force of the Future – to ensure we keep competing for top talent in the years ahead to build a force that’s just as excellent as the men and women serving our country around the world today.  And that’s why I’ve come to CCNY this morning."
"America has a lot of strengths, and our future is very bright – our economy is growing, we have world-class universities like this one, and we have the strongest military.  But another strength we have is all of the students here.  That generation is incredibly talented, diverse, it’s innovative, it’s tech-friendly – and many of you are interested in public service, whether in government, schools, non-profits, or volunteering in your community.  But one opportunity many CCNY students, some of you may not have considered, is serving our country by serving in the military – and that’s what I want to talk to you about today:  how we’re not only making military service more attractive, but also a place where you can maximize your talent and skills while doing one of the noblest things a person can do – defend our country and leave a better world for our children."
"Shortly after I was sworn as Secretary of Defense, I went to my old high school in Pennsylvania to outline this vision for the Force of the Future.  I told the students there how we in the Pentagon must think outside our five-sided box to make ourselves even better at attracting talent from new generations of Americans. "
"In the months that followed, I traveled the country, hearing from companies like LinkedIn, Facebook, Boeing and more, and also from our own innovative troops and military leaders about what they’re all doing to compete for talent in 21st century, and what we can learn from them to improve our own talent management. And over the last year, we’ve done a lot. I’ve announced four different links to this Force of the Future, and that’s just the beginning – each of these are constantly being updated, and they’re our agenda for making sure that we have and continue to have the finest fighting force."
"I announced the first link a year ago this month, creating what I called at that time new on-ramps and new off-ramps – new on-ramps so more people outside of DoD can come in for a while and contribute to our mission, maybe just for one project, maybe just for a time.  And new off-ramps so more people who are in our military can spend some time at a leading university or a leading company, to gain skills that they can bring back into our force to make us better."
"The next link focused on increasing retention by supporting military families at the critical time of their life where they’ve proven their worth to us and we’ve invested heavily in them, and that’s the time in which many of them are thinking about having a family. And this may not be top-of-mind for many CCNY students yet, but you should know that the majority of our force is married and families are a big factor when our people decide whether to stick with us or not. We can’t change the fundamentals of military service, but wherever possible, we want to make it easier for our best people to stay. So we’ve expanded maternity and paternity leave, extended childcare hours on base, and we’re offering more military families the possibility of staying in the community where they’re stationed a bit longer before being reassigned in exchange for a few more years of service."
"A third link focused on military talent management, especially for officers and how they’re promoted. As some of you may know, our traditions and our systems go back a long way, and it’s a good thing. But because how we do this hasn’t changed much in a long time, in some ways it’s become too rigid – most importantly, for the needs of our military leaders, but also for the career aspirations of our servicemembers. So we’re making it possible to infuse some more flexibility and choice, continuing to make sure that our merit-based promotion system accounts for performance and talent as much as possible."
"And most recently, link number four to the Force of the Future focused on civilian talent management. You may not know that while we have over 2 million servicemembers in uniform, we also have 700,000 civilians. These are people who fix our planes, build our ships, staff our wonderful scientific laboratories, and more. And not everyone will choose to serve in uniform and we have critical jobs for people as civilians – there may be some in this room who will apply for them – by directly hiring civilians on college campuses, which we’re now able to do, just made that change, without the long waits for a job offer that make it near impossible of us to be their first choice – as well as by expanding scholarship-for-service programs in science and technology fields, and more."
"In addition to all these links, over the last year we also opened all combat positions in all four military services to women, and we also lifted DoD’s ban on transgender servicemembers – all with the goal of being able to draw from 100 percent of America’s population for our all-volunteer force, focusing purely on a person’s willingness and ability to serve our country and contribute to our mission. And we’ve doubled down on our pledge to help our servicemembers transition to veteran status when they move on to whatever’s next for them in life, so that they can succeed in every way possible."
"All this is necessary to help us compete for top talent in the future, but it’s not sufficient.  Today our military and our troops are popular, and they’re widely supported by the American people – and I very much appreciate that, because I remember a time when it was different.  But because of all the success of the all-volunteer force – it is because we don’t use a draft anymore, we haven’t for 40 years – many Americans have become less familiar with us.  Indeed, in surveys and focus groups we run, almost half of young Americans tell us they have little or no knowledge about military service. And this may be related to trends we’ve been seeing recently in military recruiting, both in terms of where our recruits come from, and also where their parents served – whether their parents served."
"Geographically, first, our military’s recruiting pool is shrinking. More and more of our people coming from fewer and fewer states. Today, young Americans from rural areas are two times more likely to join the military than young Americans from urban areas. And 40 percent of those who join the military come from just six states, including New York. Most of our officers come from northern states, while the vast majority of our enlisted force comes from southern states.  At the moment, military recruiting tends to be most successful in the South, the Southwest, Big Sky Country, and most difficult in the Northeast.  That’s paradoxical, since the Northeast is among the regions with the highest percentage of young Americans who have the qualifications to serve.  So these geographic gaps represent an opportunity – a great opportunity for us – to draw talent from places where we haven’t been."
"At the same time, the military is also starting to resemble something of a family business, as those with a parent who served in uniform are almost twice as likely to join the military as those whose didn’t. Now, to be clear, that’s not necessarily a bad thing – following in the footsteps of one parent, one’s parents, or grandparents is a long and noble tradition in the military. And here, it may be happening because people are having positive experiences in the military and their kids see it as something that may be good for them, too.  And all that’s good.   But it also means that there are talented kids out there who would make great servicemembers, but they don’t have a parent showing them this opportunity. "
"Consider that in terms of pure numbers, less than 1 percent of America’s population serves in uniform – from my generation and my parent’s generation, three-in-four [had a] family member [who had] served in the military. For your generation, it’s-one in three. So unless someone has a friend or a family member who’s serving, they are most likely to see our military in movies like American Sniper, or video games like Call of Duty, or TV commercials featuring wounded warriors or troops coming home. And while all these images are somewhat true, they’re only a slice of our military’s jobs, lives, and stories, which in reality are as impressive and as varied as the more than 2 million men and women serving in uniform today."
"Over the last decade or so, this has even contributed to new misconceptions and stereotypes about military life among younger Americans. "
"For example, some tell us they think military life is incompatible with having a family, when the truth is, 52 percent of our enlisted force is married, and 70 percent of our office corps is married. These are both much greater percentages than in the population as a whole. Some people even told us they think there’s a penalty in the military for getting pregnant – that’s not only false; in fact, we now offer 12 weeks paid maternity leave for a new mother serving in uniform."
"Also, our polls show that young Americans today are 30 percent less likely than they were 10 years ago to think joining the military would let them earn money for college, yet the reality is the exact opposite. And that – during that very time, 10 years, the G.I. Bill has helped over 2.3 million veterans pay for college, and 120,000 have benefited from ROTC scholarships."
"And less than half of young Americans today – survey shows – think that the active-duty military has people like them in it, despite the fact that we have people from all walks of life in our ranks – and no matter who you are, who you love, what you look like, or where your parents came from, if you’re able and willing to serve, and meet our high standards, we give you a full and equal opportunity to do so."
"The bottom line is that because we too often talk about sacrifice alone, which is no small thing, we probably don’t spend enough time highlighting the opportunities that exist, and the fulfillment one has from achieving excellence and doing the service of your country. No one should gloss over the hardships or dangers of military life, but our servicemembers would be among the first to tell you how proud they feel to wear a uniform, how much they’ve learned and grown, and how it feels to wake up every morning to contribute something to bigger than yourself."
"If we’re going to ensure we keep recruiting top talent in future generations, we want to puncture these stereotypes and help our fellow citizens get to know today’s military for what it really is, even if they don’t have a parent, or neighbor, or coach, or a friends who served.  And in terms of where and how we recruit, we’ll be missing an opportunity if we kept fishing in only the same geographic ponds we are now. We need to seize that opportunity by fishing in more ponds, new ponds, ponds we haven’t been in in a long time. We have to draw talent from our country’s entire pool of population for our all-volunteer force."
"The first step is identifying the importance of this effort, and this a big reason why I came here to give this speech.  While I speak about this all the time, all the while we’re engaged around the world, protecting our country and confronting our enemies; nevertheless, I never take my eye off this.  Because if we’re going to help an entire generation better understand who we are and what we’re about, one speech isn’t enough – it requires a comprehensive effort across the department, and this is our focus. Let me take a few minute to tell you what we’re planning to do. And these are new things. "
"We’re going to start communicating better the value of military life – telling our story in more places, more ways, and to a broader range of audiences across the country. While we plan to do through that through several different avenues, I want to tell you about a few. "
"First, we’re going to change how we highlight our mission through advertising. There’s a long history of advertising for military service – from the century-old “I Want You” posters of Uncle Sam, to the commercials you see on primetime and network TV. These ad campaigns are meant to get potential recruits to sign up so that the military services can meet their recruiting needs; they get people in the door and help the services build a brand that sets them apart from others. Well, that’s good, but they sometimes highlight only a narrow slice of the institution and people who defend this country every day."
"Although the Defense Department used to advertise the value of military life as a whole, we got away from that over the last several years. In some ways, we’re a victim of our success, with so many people signing up after 9/11 and the Great Recession. Now we’re getting back into it. I mean, we’re starting to advertise the value of military life and public service again, and the service’s recruiting ads."
"In doing so, we’re going to reach out and talk to the American people wherever they are – which, as you know, isn’t just on TV anymore but increasingly in different places online. And we won’t just speak to potential recruits; we’re going to speak to everyone – including parents, grandparents, coaches, teachers, guidance counselors, and more who might influence a potential recruit. "
"To truly have an effect, this has to be done in a sustained way and over a long period of time. We won’t be selling the newest phones or trying to get you signed up for the newest credit card. Ultimately, what we’re selling is service and mission – a chance to be part, as I said, of something bigger than yourself, that will not only do something good for you, but let you serve others, and then after you’ve served, go on to do something great with the rest of your life like so many of our veterans do. "
"Now, since advertising can’t fully substitute for personal inspiration and contact, we’re also going to create a DoD Speaker’s Bureau of senior leaders and experts from across our military and Defense Department dedicated to helping educate key audiences – schools, parents, teachers, principals, coaches, career counselors, civic groups, cultural groups, youth groups, companies, and more – on the value and benefits of military and public service in support of our mission of national defense. And I’m the first speaker to sign up and I’m kicking that off right here, today. "
"In addition, we’re going to try to better leverage our most successful outreach programs and also help – that already help people give back to America’s communities. One example is called STARBASE, where our servicemembers volunteer in local elementary schools and help inspire kids to explore and learn more about science, technology, engineering, and math. And that allows us to help them, but also allows those little kids to get to know us in a hands-on way, and we want to have more of that opportunity in both directions. "
"Similarly, we’re also going to do some important new things to help each of the services improve their recruiting efforts, to increase our access geographically, demographically, and generationally."
"For example, I’ve heard from some of our recruiters that some high schools aren’t giving them the access they feel they need to be able to do their jobs. Now, the law requires schools to give our recruiters a basic level of access, and while it seems many schools are complying with that – recognizing that DoD might offer their students an exciting and impactful career – some others are putting up roadblocks. This is wrong. So as part of a new program to help recruiters, we’re going to survey them and identify where exactly they face impediments to access and what the most useful types of access actually are, so we can educate those educators who may not be complying with the law or who may be making life harder on their students and recruiters, and find a way to improve that. Our goal here is to better educate schools about our mission, and help them realize they should want to let us in, because it’d be a missed opportunity for their students if they don’t."
"Our services are also going to be experimenting with having their recruiters be more mobile, leveraging technologies so they can recruit across a wider geographic areas. And they’ll also review some of the benchmarks kids currently have to meet in order to join the military. When I was in Boston earlier this year, I sat down with some of our fantastic enlisted recruiters from all over the Northeast, and they told me some of the challenges they were facing with spectacular potential recruits who nevertheless also reflect the times in relation to such benchmarks as their current physical fitness, tattoos they got when they were younger, single parenthood, and the like. Now, some of these things we’ll never be able to compromise on – we’ll always have to maintain high standards.  At the same time, these benchmarks must be kept relevant for both today’s force and tomorrow’s, meaning we have to ensure that they’re not unnecessarily restrictive. So we’re going to review and update these standards as appropriate. "
"And this brings me to another way we bring talented people into the military – in fact, right here, right now – and that’s through our Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program, ROTC, located on campuses around the country. Forty percent of our officers come from ROTC. It’s also a key part of helping those who may not have been exposed to us before getting to know us."
"This is ROTC’s 100th anniversary, and because DoD’s a learning organization, and we’re always trying to improve, it stands to reason that we should use this anniversary to examine ROTC – how can we make it even better?  And that’s what our sixth link to the Force of the Future’s all about, preparing ROTC for another 100 years of success."
"There’s no question that ROTC’s had its ups and downs over the last century. But today, it’s a very successful program, and CCNY is proof of that. CCNY enrolled its first Army ROTC student in 1917, 99 years ago, the first year of the program, making it one of the first programs in the whole country. And it was subsequently a mainstay ROTC school until 1971, when the Faculty Senate voted to cut ties with the military to protest the Vietnam War, as many other colleges and universities did at the time. ROTC didn’t return until after “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” was repealed a few years ago, which allowed gay and lesbian Americans to serve openly. And since ROTC came back to CCNY in 2013, cadets graduating from here have gone on to assignments in exciting fields, like cyber and military intelligence, and serve in places all around the world, South Korea, Japan, Middle East."
"Now, we want to make sure that these detachments are able to thrive, help more people on these campuses to get to know us, and thereby help us attract talent to contribute to our mission. We plan to do this by focusing on those who participate in ROTC, and those who lead it, and on the program overall. "
"Now, to make sure ROTC keeps attracting great participants like Cadet Reynolds, your instructors here also, we’ll be offering more graduate school scholarships – especially for law school and medical school – for students who are college seniors. We’ll also offer more two- and three-year ROTC scholarships, which will make it easier for someone who maybe didn’t know about ROTC at first, but will be able to participate nevertheless and serve if they learned about it maybe from a roommate or a teammate or a classmate once they get to campus. We’re going to sponsor more high school students interested in science, technology, engineering, and math to shadow ROTC cadets at schools that specialize in those fields, to help them open their eyes to how ROTC’s worth a try.  And to reward cadets that challenge themselves academically – for example, if they choose a more rigorous academic major or deliberately seek out harder courses – we plan to make it possible for them to get credit for that when they commission, specifically in how their service generates what we call the branching and assignment Order of Merit list, which basically means giving them a greater choice in what they’ll do in the military."
"Next, turning to those who instruct ROTC cadets, because so many of our officers come from ROTC units, we want them to be taught by our very best – just like you want the best professors and you all check out your evaluations on RateMyProfessor.com, we’re the same. "
"And the thing is, often in the military, just as with teachers in our society general, generally the job of being a ROTC instructor isn’t always treated as importantly as it should be. We have educators here, I’ve been an educator myself. For instance, some officers determining their next assignment may have to choose between a ROTC instructor, or accepting a command slot that would get them promoted sooner. This can make the job less appealing to those that want to advance up the ranks, making some good officers who want to make yet more good officers unable to choose to do this."
"And now, that’s not always the case. My senior military assistant, Brigadier General Eric Smith – Eric, where are you? – who’s here today – right back there, Eric, my senior military assistant in the Office of the Secretary of Defense – instructed future Marine officers in the Navy ROTC program at Texas A&M. And he’ll tell you it was fantastic. So did our Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joe Dunford – he was a Marine Officer Instructor at Holy Cross in Massachusetts for three years – the first ever Chairman, by the way, to have ever done so. And that not only gave him critical insights into the generation of officers that he would lead in the future, but it also helped him build closer ties between us and that community. "
"Teaching leadership on a college campus is something DoD should reward, and we need to encourage and make it easier for our best people to do so. And that’s why I’ve directed the military services to ensure that their officer promotion and selection boards appropriately value those who serve as ROTC instructors. We’re also going to set up a pipeline for officers who did ROTC themselves to give back to the program and be instructors later in their careers."
"Lastly, in terms of the ROTC program as a whole, we want it to be continuously improving nationwide, with units and schools across the country sharing best practices and good ideas that might work for others. "
"Right now we don’t have a way to know which units are doing great things that others might want to consider adopting, in part because we have so many programs all over the country – more, by the way, than at the end of the Vietnam War – so we’re going to develop data-driven ways to accurately measure and assess which ROTC units are most effective in performing their mission. And we’re going to look at much more than just how many officers they commission each year, because quality and training and innovative ideas and things like reaching back into the local community and strengthening connections with the school are important, too. ROTC units that stand out the most each year will be eligible for a new reward recognizing their excellence, the Secretary of Defense ROTC Futures Award – and I challenge CCNY to be among the first to get it."
"Now, I want to be clear that for all we’ve done over the last year – including the plans I’ve laid out today – building the Force of the Future isn’t going to happen overnight. It’s going to be a generational effort, and this is just the beginning. Because our goal is to address challenges and seize opportunities that have arisen over years and decades, and we have to sustain and build on this over the years and decades ahead as well. I’m confident we can, because for the first time in a long time, the parts of the Pentagon that handle the health, the welfare, the readiness, and the talent management of our people across the entire lifetime of their service have a clear roadmap for where they’re going and what they’re going to do in the years ahead. And we’ll keep innovating as we learn more, do more and as society and technology change. "
"After all, we want people to consider military and public service because when it comes to working in national security, no matter what they do, military or civilian, they’ll be better off for having been part of this incredible mission. And that’s true for all of you as well.  Whether it’s the people, the skills, or the experiences, nothing else compares to it – I guarantee it."
"You know, it’s been said that security is like oxygen. When you have it, you don’t think about it, but when you don’t have it, it’s all you ever think about. The men and women who serve in our military provide that security, that oxygen, not only to Americans, but to many all over the world who still depend on us for their oxygen, too. That allows millions of Americans and millions of our friends and allies to get up in the morning, and to go to work, to go to schools like CCNY, to live their lives, and dream their dreams, and give their children a better future. That is one of the noblest things a person can do, and there’s no other feeling like waking up every morning and knowing you’re contributing to that mission. "
"While I don’t expect all of you to join us, I do ask you to give it some thought and to give encouragement when a friend, or a sibling, maybe even one day a child of yours might decide to do so. "
"I wouldn’t even be surprised if there’s a future Secretary of Defense sitting here or somewhere on this campus at CCNY today, or a future Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff sitting among the ROTC cadets here. But I’m also confident that you all have something to contribute: a drive to be something – part of something bigger than yourself. And that’s where the call to service begins. And that’s the beginning of how we’ll make a better and a brighter world – together. "

"The Department of Defense (DoD) announced the launch of Code.mil, an open source initiative that allows software developers around the world to collaborate on unclassified code written by federal employees in support of DoD projects."
"DoD is working with GitHub, an open source platform, to experiment with fostering more collaboration between private sector software developers and federal employees on software projects built within the DoD. The Code.mil URL redirects users to an online repository that will house code written for a range of projects across DoD for individuals to review and make suggested changes."
"This is a direct avenue for the department to tap into a worldwide community of developers to collectively speed up and strengthen the software development process. In exchange, DoD program code hosted on GitHub will be open and available for individuals to reuse and repurpose for personal and public projects. "
Creating new communities in open source
"Open source and free software (which refers to software freedom, not free of cost) are industry best practices and integral parts of modern software development. They, however, are concepts yet to be widely adopted within the department. With Code.mil, DoD can access a depth and breadth of technical skill previously underutilized while offering software tools created by the government for free public use."
"Another objective for Code.mil is to create a network of peers between the federal government and the developer community to encourage participation, share knowledge, and make connections in support of DoD programs that ultimately service our national security."
"The Defense Digital Service (DDS) spearheads the Code.mil initiative. DDS was established in 2015 to bring private sector best practices, talent, and technology into the department. DDS is a team of self-described nerds who come in on short stints from companies such as Google, Amazon, and Netflix to work on problems impacting DoD. Current projects include “Hack the Pentagon,” Next Generation GPS (OCX) and Defense Travel System modernization."
Open source challenges in government
"DoD faces unique challenges in open sourcing its code. Code written by federal government employees typically does not have copyright protections under U.S. and some international laws, which creates difficulties in attaching open source licenses."
Code.mil is experimenting with a legal pathway of using contract law in the Defense Open Source Agreement to add commonly used licenses to DoD software projects. DDS consulted with the Open Source Initiative and Free Software Foundation on devising a comprehensive approach to both open and free software. 
"“We want to better incorporate the norms of the open source and free software communities into the department,” said Sharon Woods, DDS legal counsel. “We hope this agreement will serve as a bridge so we can use widely adopted open source licenses even without U.S. copyright protections.” "
Call to action
"In true open source fashion, DDS is hosting an open call to developers, lawyers, and other members of the open source and free software communities across the government and private industry to comment and review a draft open source agreement that is currently available on Code.mil. The agreement will outline the terms of use and participation, and will be finalized by the end of March. "
The DDS will be the first to host project code written by their team of developers on Code.mil upon finalization of the open source agreement.
ACTING ASSISTANT TO THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR PUBLIC AFFAIRS CHARLES SUMMERS: All right.  Good afternoon.
"It's good to see many of you back in the room, busy day today at the Pentagon.  And I want to thank you again for being here for the department's introduction to the final report of the Defense Innovation Board's Software Acquisition and Practices Study."
Under Secretary Lord and our distinguished guests from Defense Innovation Board are here to highlight the -- the importance of software and to detail what the department needs to maintain our technological advantage for decades to come.  Each will provide opening remarks and then Lieutenant Colonel Andrews will facilitate the questions.
"And we have a hard stop at 1:05, 13:05."
"And with that, ladies and gentleman?"
"UNDER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ELLEN LORD: Thank you, Charlie."
Good afternoon.
"This morning, my office formally delivered to Congress the final report of the Defense Innovation Board's Software Acquisition and Practices Study, or SWAP.  The report, I think, is an energizing product and coincides with renewed and palpable momentum to quickly evolve our approach to software acquisition and development."
"Implementation of some of the study's recommendations, such as the creation of new acquisition pathways for software and a new mechanism for authorization to operate reciprocity, are already under way."
"The department appreciates the efforts of the Defense Innovation Board, the internal department working group that supported the study and many others who contributed their time and expertise to the creation of the report."
"Its format, fittingly, differs from past study reports the department and Congress have commissioned on software and technology acquisition challenges.  It is a remarkably accessible product.  Its recommendations are time-bound and, most importantly, it includes draft implementation plans, complete with proposed lead stakeholders, which my staff and I are already iterating on."
"I plan to provide an initial implementation plan to the defense oversight committees within the next 60 days.  And then the OSD team will continually implement and iterate on that plan, providing full visibility to all stakeholders."
"Defense technological advantage today is enabled by hardware, but its capability is defined by software.  There is an undeniable urgency to develop and deploy software faster, faster than our adversaries, in order to maintain strategic and tactical advantage."
"As Dr. Schmidt aptly noted in his forward to the report, that it is, quote, ""scarcely possible to imagine how the department can achieve the modernization objectives of the National Defense Strategy without overhauling its approach to software."""
"I am committed to sustaining the pace of change, beginning with A&S strategic priorities.  A&S is taking a comprehensive approach to software modernization and, in partnership with the services and other OSC elements, will action the SWAP recommendations in conjunction with the most relevant recommendations from previous reports, including the Defense Science Board's Design and Acquisition of Software for Defense Systems and the 809 Panel report."
DOD cannot achieve the full breadth of its software modernization priorities alone.  We must partner with the private sector and Congress to enable delivery of world-cost -- world-class software at the speed of relevance.
"The department has the authorities it needs to modernize its approach to software development, but navigating the current system is too onerous.  The department calls upon Congress to provide explicit and specific authorities for software, such as a new appropriations category to fund software as a single budget item."
"With that, I'd like to hand it over to Dr. Eric Schmidt."
"DEFENSE INNOVATION BOARD CHAIRMAN ERIC SCHMIDT: Well, thank you, Secretary Lord."
"When you started a little bit more than a year ago, this gap in software was one of the first things that you noticed.  And at about the same time, the Congress actually wrote into law that we had to do this report."
"I have famously opposed doing any reports because I assumed nothing would happen.  So we've been doing, sort of, hand-to-hand combat and engagement internally to try to change, as best we could."
"So we embarked on this report to essentially identify a huge shortcoming in the DOD, which is the modernization of its software."
"And when I come here, I think of the software as being, like, 1990s software.  It -- it feels, sort of, of that generation.  And I've done this a long time.  And it worked pretty well back then, but it isn't appropriate for now."
"And what I'm particularly proud about was that the study was done in the open.  And so you can see not only the pieces of the study as it was developed in the open and with lots of feedback, but you could even see the comments from many, many commenters, many critics and many stakeholders."
"What's interesting is that, in software, you have a normal process of iteration.  You have a:  we try this, we try this, and so forth and so on.  It's as much art as science.  And that process is not available to the software people inside of DOD.  The historic acquisition process -- which is, sort of, requirements, procurement, wait, deliver and -- and turn on -- is not how software is built."
"And so it became fairly clear to our team that it was necessary to have legislative changes as well as operational changes, which the Secretary Lord was already, sort of, thinking about."
And so the reason to have a report is that it takes two to tango.  It takes the leadership on the DOD side and on the Congress.  The legislation has to reflect modern software practices.
"So it seems to me that these -- these recommendations are transformative in that the -- the groundwork that we're laying should allow everybody to, sort of, operate in a more modern way.  "
"And if you're confused by that, you say, ""Oh, yes, it's just another report,"" remember that our opponents don't have the installed base of software that we do and, therefore, they can leapfrog and presumably produce even higher software-centric things that we have to deal with.  We need to address this now."
MICHAEL MCQUADE: Thank you.
"My name's Michael McQuade.  Along with my colleague, Dr. Richard Murray, I'm one of the co-chairs.  Just a couple of brief comments and then Richard's going to talk a little bit about some of the specific substance."
I would just echo a couple of comments you've heard.
"One of the first things we did, even before we determined a plan to take on this study, was to look back at the tens, hundreds of studies around software acquisition that have been done across the government."
"And in many ways, I would tell you that, at the end of this process, much of what we have found, you can find in lots of studies that have occurred here over the years.  And in fact, one of the standard refrains we had is, if you look at the 1987 Defense Science Board study on software acquisition and you take the word ""ADA"" out and replace it with ""Agile,"" you actually have a pretty good study."
"What -- what was going to make a difference?  And -- and Eric just talked about this.  The fact is software matters even more now than it has ever mattered.  The capability that we deliver -- while enabled by hardware, and enabled by the amazing men and women who deploy that capability -- is defined by software.  So the problem is more important than ever."
"We tried to do this study very differently; we tried to do this the way you do software.  Not just because that's a clever way to do a study, but because that's part of the cultural change that has to happen in the way the department improves its implementation of the -- of the recommendations in this study.  It is an iterative process; software is correctly always done starting small, iterating and moving forward."
"The second point I would make is that as you read through the study, please carefully read the sentence that says, ""Not all software is the same.""  "
"Because it is very easy to take one of the recommendations in here which is about, for example, how you should acquire off-the-shelf, COTS software, and it's very easy to talk about how that doesn't apply to the embedded code on a -- on a fighter aircraft.  That's precisely the point, precisely the point, that there is different software and it is implemented different ways.  And the recommendations in the study need to think about that as we go forward."
"The final thing I would say is that we make a statement early on in the report that says it is, in fact, true that you could likely implement almost everything in this study within the existing processes and authorities at the department.  And in so doing, you would have to be a hero and that would not be the most efficient way to do things in here."
"So the recommendations around new software pathways and new colors of money and new processes are fundamentally aimed at recognizing that software is different, and that acquiring, developing and deploying software is not the same as deploying hardware.  And that asking people to optimize a software acquisition system in a hardware framework is not the right way to operate."
"So with that, Richard's going to go through a couple things.  I just, because I think we will both do this, I want to -- to recognize and thank the staff members Courtney Barno, Devon Hardy, Sandy O'Dea and Jeff Boleng, who were instrumental in bringing this to conclusion.  And thank the entire department, including Secretary Lord, for the fantastic support that we had."
Richard?
"RICHARD MURRAY:  Great, thanks."
So just a couple of things to add to that.
"You know, I think as everybody's said, we think that this is the right time for this type of a change within the way that the department actually does its software.  As we went through, there were three main themes as you'll read in the report."
One of them is that speed and cycle time are the most important metrics for managing software.  We have to think about:  how do we get things out there quickly that need to get out there quickly?
"A second was that software is made by people and for people.  So digital talent matters, and we have to think about the digital talent within the services, within the contractor base and how to make sure that that is where it needs to be."
"And the third, as you've heard already, is that software is different from hardware, and not all software is the same.  And so we need to make sure that the acquisition pathways and the appropriation categories are optimized for software, because software is what defines the capabilities that we have for national security."
"So we've tried to go through and think about:  OK, great, those are nice themes but what do you actually have to do about it?  We've articulated four main lines of effort that we think are the most important things to do and, within those, identified just two or three recommendations each. "
"There's a top 10 set of recommendations -- there's 16 additional recommendations, but we really focused on the top 10."
"And we’ve put, as Secretary Lord said, an initial, kind of, implementation plan, here’s a -- here's the starting point.  And we look forward to working with the department as it teases out that, and working with Congress as they help enable that."
"I think that it is the case that the U.S. private sector has figured out how to do software.  The U.S. Department of Defense, working with Congress, needs to take advantage of that incredible strength that the country has.  And so I think the time is now to do that.  There’s great alignment in terms what's going on.  And so I think we just need to start moving forward and actually go do something."
"And I'd just like to echo Michael's comments in thanking the -- the staff and all of the people who've met with us at the Pentagon.  It's been a very interactive process.  We have engaged with lots of people in industry and government all over and so I'd like to thank all of those people -- and in particular, Courtney, Devon, Sandy and Jeff -- for all of their help."
So with that…
"STAFF:  Ladies and gentlemen, before we start the questions, out of respect for those who have traveled here today just to talk about this, if we can just keep the question on this.  Ms. Lord is going to do a media engagement next week to talk all things acquisition."
"So starting with that, Marcus?"
Q:  Scott had his hand up.
Q:  Scott Maucione with Federal News Network.
"Can you explain a little bit more about the -- the color of money and how you're -- you're categorizing it?  The acquisition -- I'm sorry, the budget cycle is one year; Agile software is not a one-year cycle, so..."
"MS. LORD:  Exactly, exactly."
Q:  … how -- how would that work?
"MS. LORD:  So the thought process is right now, if you definitely -- if you do DevOps, what you're going to be doing is development, production and sustainment all at once most of the time. "
"Right now, as you know, we have different pools of money that we have to very carefully allocate.  So what we've been talking to the appropriators about is writing in the '20 bill the opportunity to do multiple pilots; where, we would have just one line for software development so we can move back and forth amongst those different stages to give us what I'll call administrative flexibility."
"I don't believe our business systems right now reflect how we do software.  So we are asking to have the authority to do some pilots in '20, looking towards some actual new language and new title in '21."
STAFF: Tony?
"Q: I wanted to ask you all about the -- the F-35, the -- the program, the biggest program on Earth -- 8,000 -- eight million lines of coding in each airplane. What lessons did you take from your report that, going forward, you need to incorporate into the F-35's so-called block four modifications to prevent, you know, the -- the major issues with blocks two through three (F, ID&C ?)..."
"MS. LORD: Got it. Perhaps I can lead, and then I'll hand off..."
(UNKNOWN): Sure.
"MS. LORD: ... to you all for comments, because one of the things that makes this study meaningful, in my opinion, is that the team looked a whole variety of software programs -- ones that have gone well, ones that haven't gone so well so that we can learn from all of them. F-35 is one program that was looked at. I will tell you, as we move forward towards gaining authority to do the pilots this fall, one of the programs that we have targeted specifically is F-35, and primarily ALIS on that, because ALIS had legs into every part. It is thought of as key for sustainability. However, it has tentacles back into development and into operations."
"Q: One quick -- quickie -- intellectual property, the (inaudible) recommendation of much -- much ado, are you going to start enforcing that in contracts, going forward? You know industry's resisted giving up their IP."
"MS. LORD: What we have done is already worked on standard IP clauses, because we want to make sure our acquisition workforce understands that we need the intellectual property that allows us, for instance, on platforms to spiral in new weapon systems, new center systems, and you have to understand the interfaces in order to be able to do that."
"We also want to make sure that we have intellectual property that allows us two, three years in production to compete sustained to make sure we get the best value. So what we are concerned about is making sure that we have rights to the intellectual property that allows us to do those two things. Otherwise right now, it's not as critical, and we're working towards that."
"As we evolve our software model, I'm thinking that basically our systems are going to be hardware enabled, but software defined so that we can rapidly spiral in capability. We'll have to look at what that means about intellectual property for source code and so forth."
"MR. MCQUADE: I'll -- I'll add one sort of a slightly facetious comment, and Richard has a substantive comment. I'll just use your -- your one comment about eight million lines of code. One lesson we've learned with the F-35 is you should never use lines of code to manage your program in any way, shape or form. In a world where software is developed and deployed by a combination of new technology where computers help write code, software lines of code is precisely a wrong metric for measuring program complexity. It leads to behavior -- if you pay somebody by lines of code, you get more lines of code. Not suggesting that's an F-35 statement, but in general -- and you'll see it in our recommendations -- you should not be measuring lines of code on a program."
"MR. MURRAY: And so one of the things we do talk about, of the other metrics you might use, speed and cycle time are the most important metrics, we think, so that's one of the things you want to look at something like F-35 and..."
"And the other thing I'll just about F-35 and lots of other programs is it's a great example where there are multiple types of software. So indeed, there's some software that is embedded software and flight control software and other things. But there's things like ALIS that really is running on commercial operating systems and on commercial hardware, and you don't have to manage those in the same way, right? And you don't -- the metrics that are there for those might be the same classes of metrics, but with different targets, depending on what they are."
STAFF: (inaudible)
"Q: Thank you. Some of the studies that have been done on DOD acquisitions that are software-intensive pointed out that the users were not involved early enough in the development. I think -- I'm sure you've researched that extensively. But can you explain what -- what goes behind a program that doesn't consult the users? I mean, how is that -- how is that even possible that billions of dollars were spent before the users actually got involved in the development?"
"MS. LORD: So I say we need to earn from the past and focus on the future, and our future focus is to make sure that operators, that users have their voice heard at the beginning of programs, because that comes in in many areas. We have to design for sustainability, for instance. People often don't realize that our platforms' major weapon systems have 70 to 80 cents on the dollar out of the full lifecycle cost on sustainability. So we need to have all those voice heard. And I know that General Selva and the whole JROC process is very, very focused on that."
"Q: Have you seen -- have you seen some of those studies like GAO just recently? Were -- were they accurate in -- in that assessment, that..."
"MR. MURRAY: I'll say, I think what we've seen when we've gone out and -- and looked at some of the programs is that often there's a -- a layer of disconnect, right? That where the requirements are coming from -- and we had talked about the fact that we don't think requirements are the right way to manage everything, but where the requirements are coming from is talking to people who oversee those programs, rather than people who are using that software. If you think about what happens in your everyday life, the way you give feedback on pieces of software, you know, if you like this or not, how many stars, et cetera, you know, how do we do that in an appropriate context? How do we go to the actual users of the software and say, ""Hey, we're rolling out this new feature. It's intended to help you do this. Is it or not,"" right?"
MS. LORD: Yeah.
MR. MURRAY: And you can do A/B testing and other things. So how do we get to that style of software follow-up?
"MS. LORD: So there are very simple questions we need to ask, and sometimes we make them much more complicated and too focused. It's, what is the problem we are trying to solve? What is the question we're trying to answer? We need to be very fundamental so we get back to basics, and don't overcomplicate this with a lot of details, but really understand what is the core functionality required? And then, what is nice to have?"
"MR. MCQUADE: The only other thing I think I would say, just very quickly, if -- if you think about the -- the meta-forward model we're trying to predict to, if you think of, ‘I have requirements’, and then I turn it over to somebody to develop, and then you're going to ask the question you've just asked about: Who's involved in writing the requirements? If you think about the way modern software is done, the issue isn't who's involved in writing the requirement. Who from the user community is intimately involved in the entire (inaudible) from beginning to -- not even end, but from beginning all the way through?"
So it becomes a very different question. It's not: who was the user who helped make the requirements? It's: who's the user who's part of the Agile DevOps process across the entire lifecycle?
"Q: OK. Tony Bertuca, Inside Defense. Thank you for -- for being with us. "
"For, Ms. Lord, on the legislative proposal to, sort of, get a color of money designation for software, which areas do you think are best suited for that, for those pilots, for the department to start transitioning into them?"
"MS. LORD: I think in order to do meaningful -- an overall meaningful pilot study, we have to have a variety of different types of programs because the objective of doing a pilot study is to really learn by doing. That's kind of my mantra. I don't want to sit around conference room tables with hypotheticals; I want to dive in and try to do something in sort of a safe way."
"So we will look at some major platforms, also at some business systems so that we can get the depth and breadth. "
"Q: And -- and also for you, but for anyone else on the panel, one of the things Mr. Schmidt mentioned was the software environment at DOD is out of the 1990s."
"Are there areas that you can tell us now, that if we can't go back and redo the entire F-35, where can the department put points on the board in this area (inaudible)?"
MS. LORD: I think what we have to do is look at programs where we have suboptimal functionality and performance right now and those where we really need step function changes in capability so that we bring the most modern coding to it. 
"But I want to emphasize, this isn't just about having software developers use Agile or DevOps, it's about teaching the acquisition workforce how you manage programs like this. So to that end, a large number of the recommendations and things we're moving out on are: how do you develop that capability? "
"So we have an enormous effort at Defense Acquisition University to change how we're doing this. We also are rewriting -- as I said earlier, I think -- 5000.02. So it's a full-court press, not just what the technical community, but also with the acquisitions and contracting and sustainment community."
"MR. MURRAY: Just to add a little, you know, I think that's absolutely critical. I think you got it exactly right. You have to have an environment in which people can productively carry out their work. I think that's what programmers want to do, is they want to see their code actually doing something useful. "
"So investing in the digital infrastructure that's required to do that, that means cloud computing, that means software stacks, it means all of the things that allow people to quickly develop capability and put it in the hands of users and get feedback on how that's doing. That's what the department's going to have to go do and that's what our recommendation is. "
"Line of Effort B, the second one, is exactly on building that digital infrastructure. "
"Q: Great, thank you. Hi. Leigh Giangreco of The Capitol Forum. "
The report mentions cloud 115 times but JEDI only once. Why didn't the report more closely examine JEDI as part of the DOD's software strategy? And then why didn't it also weigh in on the debate of single versus multi-provider?
MS. LORD: I'll give my perspective then allow you. 
"JEDI is just one of the cloud efforts within DOD. So I don't think we within DOD single out JEDI from other cloud efforts. Our focus has been more on having, you know, hardened containers in an enclave that can be accessed. We do non-recurring engineering over, and over, and over again in the Department. "
"What we're trying to do is build the capability to have a series of hardened containers that can be accessed by any contractor or within DOD. So that we -- if we use our stack, you get -- automatically get your authority to operate, so that's agnostic of what cloud it's in. It's more an approach. "
"MR. MCQUADE: I -- I would just echo the same thing, is -- you know, it was not our job, to do a report on the acquisition of a cloud, the department. That's a process that's underway. It will occur and have its own process to get there. "
"We simply make the point that if you do not have a cloud infrastructure to be able to operate, many of the things that we talked about in this report simply won't happen. "
"MS. LORD: And remember, one of our objectives in what we're doing is to have secure and resilient ecosystem in which to develop software. And this whole methodology of going to the cloud should help us enormously there, especially when we talk about small companies. "
"A large amount of our innovation comes from small companies. In this environment where cyber-security is absolutely paramount, we cannot always find a way to have small companies be able to afford to harden their systems. "
So part of what we're looking at within the department is to provide that secure environment in which to develop software. So we want to provide that environment in a cloud where that is needed by a company. 
"STAFF: Go ahead, Mike. "
"Q: Just -- sorry. Can I just ask you to clarify, if you can put in, like, layperson's terms? When you say a hardened containers, a series of that, what -- what that means, what it would look like? "
MS. LORD: So what we want to do is have a standard number of software tools or ways to do different things. Break those into the lowest -- the smallest buckets we can. And then make them so that they cannot be hacked and so that they also are updating automatically with new feeds to that software. 
"And the idea is to go in and get all the different little buckets you need. But if they're constructed in a very disciplined way, once you go and you build your code -- by virtue of the fact that you have used these -- you automatically get your authority to operate because we know it meets our security criteria. "
Q: OK. That's helpful. Thanks.
Q: Mike Stone from Reuters. Thanks for doing this. 
"So just so I understand, we're starting off with -- is it rainbow money in a wallet that will be used for pilots? What's the size of that initial authority that you're going to Congress with? And then where do you see it growing, over how many years?"
"First part of the question, you talked about..."
MS. LORD: OK. I'm going to lose track here soon. So let me answer...
Q: ... Sure.
"MS. LORD: ... that part of it. We are not asking for any money for these first pilots. We are asking to look across different lines, and pulled money, and use it. So this is more administrative flexibility versus asking for money. "
"Q: And you talked about small businesses. Oftentimes, smaller businesses that do DevOps currently are layered by an ops fixed contractor, who takes a fee. How are you going to reach out to those companies -- very small contract size, much more frequent contracts for these folks -- to come in and avoid, say, a 15 percent charge? That someone..."
"MS. LORD: So you're really getting at the crux of one of our objectives, which is to de-couple software and hardware and get the best of breed for both. So what we have to do is be able to structure our contracts, our programs to be able to do that. We also have to make it easy for small businesses to come and work with us. "
"And we would be successful if industry thought of Acquisition and Sustainment as their big helpdesk. They call in to us, our Industrial Policy group reaches out, explains how to work with us. We partner very, very closely with numerous industry organizations -- PSC, NDIA, AIA to let them know what we have for resources. "
"So part of the implementation of this study is a communications campaign to get out there and reach industry, especially small business. We actually have a new director of industrial policy, Jen Santos, who will be starting on June 3rd. We have an opening to run our small business office. We are right now interviewing people for that. That will be a key objective of that small business office, is to reach out to small businesses who want to develop software for us."
STAFF: We can go right over here. (inaudible)
"Q: Thanks. So I wanted to circle back to what Dr. Schmidt said earlier, which was the initial intent with the board was not to do reports And so we now have a report here. But the board was created by the last administration and inherited by this one. I wanted to ask, how has the work of the board, how have the processes and intent of the board changed with the change in administration? What are you looking at doing differently now, or is it exactly the same?"
MR. SCHMIDT: I can say it seems completely the same. What do you guys...
"MR. MURRAY: Yes, I agree."
"MR. SCHMIDT: our -- all of these other machinations have been largely transparent to us. I mean, we made an initial set of end recommendations now, roughly 16. The DOD is busy implementing a whole bunch of the recommendations and we're told that they're moving quickly. Now, in my world it seems a little slow, but -- but -- but..."
MS. LORD: We're catching up. We're catching up.
"MR. SCHMIDT: But -- but you know, frankly, we -- it -- it takes a leader like Ms. Lord to actually drive this stuff, and so we have it in her, so now we have the software stuff actually happening, right? As we go through in the -- in the report, people have made these kind of software reports for 30 years. Well now, it's actually happened because she's figured out she has to have it done and she cares about it, and she's going to work with Congress to make it happen."
STAFF: Travis?
"Q: Hey, Travis Tritten, Bloomberg. Thanks for being here. Appreciate it."
"The report says that the GS employment system and the military structure, as well, favors time over talent, and that that simply doesn't work when you're talking about software. So I'm wondering how you get at that problem. How do you get around that issue?"
"MR. SCHMIDT: I'll tell you, we have lots of stories. We were visiting in some deep, deep, window -- windowless room somewhere here, and we had a presentation on something involving Russia from a very young military officer, and we -- and we thought he was incredibly knowledgeable about cyber stuff. And he seemed unhappy, and so I said, like, ""What's going on?"" And he said, ""Well, I'm getting transferred to some other division next year."" ""How long have you been doing this?"" ""One year."""
"So if your basic model in the military is that you get to do cyber and software for one year, and then you go work on, you know, marketing, sales, or whatever it is he's going to do next, you don't understand software. Software is a -- is a very special thing. It's like being a doctor or being a -- you know, that kind of stuff. And we've said repeatedly that the military has to have a technical track for career people in the military and also civilians at the same level as a technical company. "
STAFF: Last question. Jeff?
"Q: When it comes to lessons learned, would it be fair to say that ALIS represents everything that is wrong about how the DOD approaches software? And how do you avoid having another ALIS in the future?"
MS. LORD: I never say (inaudible) always. 
"I think ALIS embodies a lot of requirements changing over time, as well as moving implementation. I think we can learn a lot of lessons from ALIS. I will say that the F-35 is the premier fighter aircraft today, and that it is performing very, very well."
"MS. LORD: There are things that can be improved, and we will improve them, and we do take a lot of lessons from ALIS. But we are committed, I am committed to making ALIS a premier system. "
Q: And you had mentioned that it's not good metric to pay by the line of code. Is -- are companies taking advantage of the Defense Department by adding in lines of code that simply don't need to be there...
MR. SCHMIDT: No.
Q: ... so they can build? 
"MR. SCHMIDT: No. No, it -- my -- my point is a different point. My point is that that is not the way modern software is done. So imagine that you did -- we -- in the report we talk about DevSecOps which is a cycle, and imagine that you had a software team and their job was to build today what ALIS does. "
"They would operate in a way that's quite different, according to this report, than the way the F-35 program was conceived in 2001. So the fact of the matter is software is different. And the changes that we're proposing, that I think we're going to get through, are a material change in the way software like ALIS will be done. And that was not available to the contractors, and the procurement and all the various other people involved with it, until now."
"STAFF: Ma'am, do you have any closing remarks? "
"MS. LORD: I just want to thank the Defense Innovation Board for their all-in approach. This has been a contact sport, which is great. We've had a lot of cross-functional teams and I'm particularly excited that they have committed to working the implementation for the next 12 months. So thank you all very much."
MR. SCHMIDT: Thank you. 
MR. MURRAY: Thank you.
MR. MCQUADE: Thank you.
"MR. SCHMIDT: Thank you, guys."
"Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD(AT&L)) Ellen Lord today announced the appointment of Ben FitzGerald as director, Office of Strategy and Design."
"In this role, effective Jan. 2, 2018, FitzGerald will serve as the central hub within the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) to lead the reorganization of AT&L."
"Under section 901 of the fiscal year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the Department of Defense must disestablish the Office of the USD(AT&L) and establish USDs for Acquisition and Sustainment (A&S) and Research and Engineering (R&E), as well as the Chief Management Officer."
"FitzGerald was appointed as a highly qualified expert (HQE) for a period of five years. HQEs “are individuals who possess uncommon, special knowledge, skills, and experience in an occupational field, and judgment that is accorded authority and status by peers or the public.”"
"FitzGerald has a breadth of experience across a range of strategic matters. He has served as a professional staff member for the Senate Armed Services Committee, as well as a senior fellow and director, Technology and National Security Program at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS)."
"Additionally, FitzGerald has led and contributed to diverse projects, such as military technology strategy, institutional innovation, UN peacekeeping doctrine, transitional law enforcement, the future of urban-littoral combat and the future role of the United States Marine Corps. Also, he designed and led a variety of wargames for military and civilian audiences, ranging from action officers to four-star generals."
"His experience working across DOD, Congress and think tanks, as well as his broad perspective of Congress’ intent for the AT&L reorganization, makes him ideally suited for the position."
"USD(R&E) will drive innovation and accelerate the advancement of our warfighting capability, while the USD(A&S) will deliver proven technology into the hands of the warfighter more quickly and affordably. Working from the reorganization plan previously submitted to Congress Aug. 1, 2017, FitzGerald will determine how current AT&L functions fit into the overarching objectives of the new structure and whether those functions should transition to R&E, A&S, another OSD functional lead, the Military Services or be divested altogether."

"Chairman McCain, Ranking Member Reed, Members of the Committee:  "
"Thank you for hosting me and Chairman Dunford today, and also for hosting the Chiefs of the military services last week.  I particularly appreciated your comments to them about the inefficiencies and dangers of continued budget instability and gridlock, as well as the risk of sequestration’s looming return.  I look forward to addressing those topics and more during today’s hearing."
"I also appreciate your support for our men and women serving around the world, civilian and military alike, who are the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  There’s no other military that’s stronger, or more capable, or more innovative, or more experienced, or with better friends and allies.  That’s a fact – one that every American ought to be proud of.  "
"As you know, the Department of Defense is currently addressing each of the five major, immediate, evolving challenges we face, which Chairman Dunford and I discussed with you during our budget testimony this past spring – challenges from Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, and terrorism.  And on that note, in the wake of this week’s attacks in New York, New Jersey, and Minnesota, we remain absolutely determined, as ever, to continue countering terrorists around the world who would seek to do harm to our country and our people."
"We don’t have the luxury of choosing between these challenges, which is why American soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines are working with partners from our worldwide coalition in more ways and with more power every day to accelerate the lasting defeat of ISIL, which we will surely do and want to do soon.  They’re also training and operating with our NATO allies in Europe to deter Russian aggression.  They’re sailing the waters of the Asia-Pacific as part of a principled and inclusive network of nations – ensuring that the most consequential region for America’s future remains stable, secure, and prosperous for all nations.  They’re standing guard 24/7 on the Korean Peninsula, helping strengthen our deterrent and defenses in the face of North Korea’s nuclear and missile provocations.  They’re countering Iran’s destabilizing influence against our friends and allies in the Middle East.  All the while, they’re helping protect our people here at home and helping to make a better world for our children.  And they’re preparing to contend with an uncertain future – ensuring we continue to stay the best and stay ahead in a changing and competitive world."
"As Chairman Dunford and I testified not only to this committee, but to all four of our defense oversight committees in the spring, we’ve been planning for these operations to be paid for by the Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 defense budget we developed.  And this budget not only adhered to last fall’s bipartisan budget deal in overall size; in shape, it marked a strategic turning point for DoD – making and sharpening breakthrough investments in supporting new operational concepts, in pioneering and dominating technological frontiers, in reforming the DoD enterprise, and in building the force of the future.  That budget also put an extremely high premium on continued funding to rebuild the readiness of our forces – requiring not only stable resources, but also time – the importance of which you heard about from the Chiefs last week.  Nothing is more important than readiness to me or them.  And yet today, just eight days away from the end of this fiscal year and the beginning of the next, that budget has yet to be funded by Congress – another topic, and a challenge, that I’ll address in greater detail shortly."
"Because this hearing is focused in part on ongoing military operations, let me begin with an operational update focusing specifically on our campaign to deliver ISIL a lasting defeat."
Counter-ISIL Operational Update
"In each of the four times that Chairman Dunford and I have appeared before this committee since last October, I walked you through how we were continually accelerating this campaign – starting with outlining our coalition military campaign plan, which is focused on three objectives that I’ve stressed consistently."
"The first objective is to destroy the ISIL cancer’s parent tumor in Iraq and Syria.  ISIL’s occupation of territory in those countries threatens not only the lives of the Iraqi and Syrian peoples and the stability of that vitally important region, but also the security of our own citizens and those of our friends and allies.  That means the sooner we defeat ISIL in Iraq and Syria – the sooner we destroy both the fact and the idea of an Islamic state based on ISIL’s barbaric ideology – the safer all of us will be.  That’s why we’re applying simultaneous pressure on ISIL from multiple directions and across domains – on the ground, from the air, and in cyberspace.  We’re doing all this consistent with our strategic approach, which is to enable capable, motivated, local forces – for that is the only way to defeat ISIL and keep them defeated, ensuring a lasting defeat.  "
"Now, while defeating ISIL in Iraq and Syria is necessary, it’s not sufficient."
"Indeed, we know this cancer can metastasize, and in some cases it already has.  This brings me to the second objective of our coalition military campaign plan, which is to combat ISIL’s metastases around world.  And that’s why U.S. and coalition forces are engaged in supporting capable, motivated local forces in operations against ISIL in Afghanistan, in Libya, and elsewhere, and in countering ISIL across the intangible geography and terrain of the Internet.  "
"Our third objective is to help protect the homeland.  Here, recent events continue to emphasize the importance of this mission.  This is mainly the responsibility of our partners in the FBI, the Justice Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Intelligence Community, and state and local law enforcement.  But DoD strongly supports them in a number of important ways that I’ll describe in more detail later in this testimony."
"Now, as I noted, Chairman Dunford and I have seen you several times since last October, when we first described to you our plan to accelerate the campaign against ISIL.  And since then, we’ve taken a great many steps to do just that.  As we take advantage of new opportunities generated by new intelligence, newly trained partners, and strikes against ISIL leaders, infrastructure, and finances, we’re generating more new opportunities, and then seizing those opportunities to repeat this cycle – reinforcing success.  And I should note that every time Chairman Dunford and I have recommended additional accelerating actions to President Obama, he has approved them."
"Let me briefly remind you of the initial steps we took beginning last fall to start accelerating the campaign.  First, we deployed additional strike aircraft to Incirlik to support an expanded air campaign against new targets and new categories of targets illuminated by refined intelligence.  We deployed an initial contingent of special operations forces to Syria.  We expanded efforts to equip Syrian Arab Coalition forces engaged in the fight against ISIL.  We began enabling capable, motivated local forces in southern Syria as well, and enhancing Jordan’s own border control and defenses.  We leveraged air power and advisors to help the Peshmerga take Sinjar, cutting the Iraqi side of the main line of communication between ISIL’s power centers in Raqqa and Mosul.  We introduced an expeditionary targeting force to go after ISIL leaders wherever they may be attempting to hide.  We worked to improve our ability to target ISIL’s leadership and presence beyond Iraq and Syria.  We started to expand the military campaign against ISIL to every domain, including cyber.  We stepped up our homeland defense and force protection measures to counter any additional threats to our facilities and our personnel at home and abroad.  We began precision strikes against ISIL senior leaders and training camps in Libya – removing ISIL’s leader there, Abu Nabil, for instance.  And we went after ISIL in Afghanistan."
"These were followed this past spring and summer with even more accelerants.  In Iraq, in close coordination with the Iraqi government, I announced we would be adding additional personnel there to enable the Iraqis to make faster progress in Anbar and Ninewa Provinces.  I also announced that we would be placing advisors with the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) down to the brigade and battalion level; leveraging Apache attack helicopters to support the ISF’s efforts to envelop and then retake Mosul; sending additional High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) batteries to support the Iraqi ground offensive there; and, providing financial assistance to the Peshmerga, up to $415 million, to bolster one of the most effective fighting forces against ISIL.  Meanwhile, in Syria, we announced a six-fold increase of U.S. forces there, from 50 to 300, to help expand ongoing efforts to identify, train, and equip capable, motivated local anti-ISIL forces inside Syria, especially among the Sunni Arab community.  And in addition to initiating training inside Syria, we’ve also continued to refine our train-and-equip efforts of other vetted Syrian forces outside of Syria, using the important authorities and funding provided to us by Congress under the Section 1209 program – and here, as I’ve described to you before, we’re keeping our focus on battle-hardened, proven anti-ISIL leaders whom we could make more capable as enablers and amplifiers of our effects."
"At the same time, in addition to accelerating the campaign with more U.S. capabilities, we renewed our outreach to coalition members, including in Europe, in the Middle East, and in Asia.  And over the last nine months, I’ve convened my counterparts several times – in Paris, Brussels, Riyadh, Stuttgart, and here in Washington this past July – not only to rally them behind the campaign plan and the next steps in its execution, but above all to urge them to contribute more, and in more meaningful ways.  As we’ve done more, so have our partners.  That collaboration will continue. "
"In sum, we steadily executed the campaign plan and first set of plays we devised and I described to this committee many months ago.  Now we’re on to the next plays in our campaign, which you’ll recall Chairman Dunford and I previewed for you in April, and are now underway – more on that in a moment."
"Because the acceleration of our campaign has continued since then, I’d like to now update you on the latest results of the coalition’s military campaign, as well as what we will need to do going forward."
Destroying ISIL’s Parent Tumor
"Let me begin with our first objective, destroying ISIL’s parent tumor in Iraq and Syria.  Here, since last fall – town after town, from every direction, and in every domain – our campaign and operations have accelerated, pressuring and squeezing ISIL, and rolling it back towards Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria.  While we have much more work to do – including to collapse ISIL’s control over Mosul and Raqqa – the results of our efforts are showing.

"In Iraq, we’ve been enabling the Iraqi Security Forces led by Prime Minister Abadi and the Kurdish Peshmerga commanded by Iraqi Kurdistan Regional President Barzani.  After retaking Ramadi and establishing a staging base at Makhmour, the ISF went on to retake Hit, Rutbah, Fallujah, and the important airfield and town of Qayyarah – setting the stage to complete the envelopment and isolation of Mosul and collapse ISIL’s control over it.  In the last few days, the ISF began operations to retake Sharqat and other towns surrounding Mosul.  And the final assault on Mosul will commence – as with previous operations – when Prime Minister Abadi gives the order.  In the meantime, the coalition has been actively laying the groundwork with the generation of necessary Iraqi Security Forces and Kurdish Peshmerga, preparation of staging areas, and positioning of our strike assets to cover the assaulting Iraqi and Kurdish forces.  In close coordination with the Iraqi government, these efforts are being bolstered by the addition of 560 U.S. troops I announced in July.  And we stand ready to contribute even more, in consultation with our Iraqi partners."
"In Syria, our coalition has also enabled considerable results by our local partners.  There, local forces retook Shaddadi – severing a key link between Raqqa and Mosul, and thereby ISIL in Iraq and ISIL in Syria – and then Manbij City – clearing a key transit point for ISIL’s external operators and plotters, and letting us gain intelligence insights that have helped us map ISIL’s network of foreign fighters.  Additionally, our ally Turkey is helping local Syrian partners clear the Turkish-Syrian border region of ISIL.  We’re working shoulder-to-shoulder with the Turks, supporting those efforts from the air, on the ground, and with intelligence, and we will continue to coordinate with them as we have with all of our partners so far.  And in that regard, I welcome the Turkish government’s comments about the importance of working with local partners."
"As we do all this, we are managing challenges that we’ve foreseen, including friction between some of our partners and also political instability.  That’s why our forces and commanders on the ground and in the region remain laser-focused on overcoming these challenges, so we can continue to accelerate our campaign.  "
"Indeed, even with the considerable results achieved so far, we are not letting up.  Across both Iraq and Syria, our coalition continues to pressure ISIL in several key ways.  "
"We’re systematically eliminating ISIL’s leadership: the coalition has taken out seven members of the ISIL Senior Shura – including ISIL’s Minister of War, Omar al-Shishani; ISIL’s Finance Minister, Hajji Iman; ISIL’s Minister of Information, Dr. Wa’il; and ISIL’s Chief of External Operations, Abu Muhamad Al-Adnani, who was one of ISIL’s most lethal leaders and was actively plotting to kill civilians abroad.  We also removed key ISIL leaders in both Libya and Afghanistan.  Wherever our local partners have advanced, we’ve taken out ISIL field commanders.  And we’ve removed from the battlefield more than 20 of ISIL’s external operators and plotters, including Jihadi John and Junaid Hussein, among others."
"Beyond key ISIL personnel, we’re continuing to go after key ISIL capabilities, including its attempts to develop chemical weapons.  As you know, we previously captured one of the principals of ISIL’s chemical warfare enterprise, and just last week, in one of the single largest airstrikes of our campaign, we destroyed a former pharmaceutical facility near Mosul that ISIL tried to use as a chemical weapons plant.  Meanwhile, we’re also continuing to aggressively attack the economic infrastructure that ISIL uses to fund its operations – from oil wells and tanker trucks to cash storage sites and key financial centers.   And we continue to take the fight to ISIL across every domain, including cyber."
"All of this together underscores how we are putting ISIL on the path to a lasting defeat in Iraq and Syria.  And we are now launching a decisive phase of our campaign, as the plays we’re currently executing culminate in the isolation and collapse of ISIL’s control over Raqqa and Mosul.  "
"Now, we aren’t yet releasing the full operational details of these plays in public.  That’s because – as I told troops from the XVIII Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg in July before they deployed to lead our operations in Iraq and Syria under the command of Lieutenant General Steve Townsend – we don’t want the enemy to know too much about what we’re doing, what we’re thinking, and where we’re going and when.  But I do want to broadly describe the basic elements to you, as I did with our troops in July. "
"In Syria, operations are focused on shutting down the last remaining paths for ISIL fighters to move into and out of that country – particularly when it comes to their external operators – and then on generating forces and preparing them for the envelopment of Raqqa.  We’re seeking to expand on recent gains of our local, capable partners in Manbij City, along the Mar’a Line, and elsewhere in Northern Syria to help them ensure ISIL cannot control that key terrain.  And in addition, we will aggressively pursue opportunities to build pressure on ISIL in Syria from the south, complementing our existing robust efforts from northeastern Syria."
"In Iraq, our actions in the western part of the country are focused on enabling the ISF to pursue mopping-up operations along the Euphrates River Valley – in order to clear the remaining pockets of ISIL presence, push the ISIL threat farther away from Baghdad, and help the government of Iraq reassert not only full control over its borders, but also control over some of its main lines of communications.  In the north, we’re continuing to help the ISF clear the remaining pockets of ISIL control along the Tigris River Valley leading up to Mosul.  And we’ve been helping the ISF and Kurdish Peshmerga to refit and generate the forces and logistical footprint necessary for their joint efforts to isolate and pressure Mosul, approaching from both the north and the south. "
"Meanwhile, as this isolation and pressure on Raqqa and Mosul continues to build from the outside in, our partners will continue to reach deep inside those cities to pressure ISIL from the inside out.  "
"It’s already becoming clear that with the simultaneity of operations and pressure coalition forces are applying across Iraq and Syria, ISIL will simply no longer be able to resist.  And while ISIL is still a dangerous adversary and its lasting defeat will take time, we will continue to gather momentum until ISIL is defeated.  "
"Finally, with respect to the Syrian civil war, I commend Secretary Kerry for working so tirelessly to seek an arrangement which, if implemented, would ease the suffering of the Syrian people and get Russia pushing for a political transition, which is the only way to end the Syrian civil war.  There remains a ways to go to see if the terms of that arrangement will be implemented – unfortunately the behavior we’ve seen from Russia and Syria over the last few days is deeply problematic."
Combatting ISIL’s Metastases
"This brings me to the results in our campaign’s second objective, combatting ISIL’s metastases everywhere they appear around the world – particularly in Libya and Afghanistan.  I will address these in turn."
"A few months ago, Chairman Dunford and I expressed concern that if left untended, Libya could be the next ISIL headquarters, as ISIL’s control over the city of Sirte was seen as their contingency plan for where they would go when they lost Raqqa and Mosul.  But because the President authorized us to act, ISIL is now under tremendous pressure there, with its territory in Sirte reduced to a single square kilometer.  Indeed, after some 50 days of supporting capable, motivated local forces fighting ISIL in its safe haven of Sirte, coalition operations – including with airstrikes at the request of Libyan Government of National Accord Prime Minister Sarraj – have shrunk ISIL’s territory to a single neighborhood.  I’m confident ISIL will be ejected from Sirte, and that we will keep looking for opportunities to combat ISIL in Libya; however, it is important to note that these are the military results.  As we’ve known from the beginning, political progress will have to follow, including reconciliation, to deliver ISIL a lasting defeat in Libya."
"Let me now turn to Afghanistan, where we continue to counter terrorists – both ISIL and al-Qaeda – as well as help support and strengthen the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF), which has the lead in fighting the Taliban and other terrorists within Afghanistan’s borders.  "
"Working with our Afghan partners, we conducted a large operation against ISIL in Afghanistan over the last two months – dealing it severe blows, including killing its top leader, Hafiz Sayed Khan, and 11 other ISIL leaders, as well as degrading the organization’s infrastructure, logistics base, and recruiting.  There will be more to come in short order."
"Meanwhile, more broadly, the U.S. military continues to execute its two missions in Afghanistan – countering terrorism, and helping train, advise, and assist the ANDSF as part of NATO’s Resolute Support Mission.  As you know, President Obama approved our requests earlier this year to retain a more substantial U.S. force presence into 2017, to enhance the authorities of our ground commanders, and to maintain our financial commitment to the ANDSF through 2020.  This will lead to positive effects.  Indeed, while challenges remain – including political challenges – we’re increasingly seeing the ANDSF undertake unilateral missions against ISIL and other targets on their own accord, with U.S.-provided equipment."
Helping Protect our Homeland and our People
"Meanwhile, DoD continues to provide strong support to our partners in the FBI, the Justice Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Intelligence Community, and state and local law enforcement to help protect our homeland and our people.  This is the number-one mission of our Northern Command.  And here the U.S. military is supporting our partners in three critical ways."
"First, we’re ensuring the force protection for our troops and the DoD facilities where they work and reside – both on base, and the thousands of off-base installations we operate.  Last summer’s tragedy in Chattanooga underscored how ISIL seeks to target U.S. troops and DoD civilians, which is why we’re putting in place stronger physical security systems, including stronger entry controls, better alarm systems, reinforced doors, additional ways to safely exit our facilities, and more.  And we continue to look for more ways to improve and strengthen our force protection."
"Second, we’re disrupting ISIL’s external operations and its ability to conduct such operations.  As I discussed earlier, our operations to destroy ISIL’s parent tumor directly support this effort, where we’ve removed dozens of ISIL external operators from the battlefield – including, as I mentioned earlier in this testimony, ISIL’s Chief of External Operations, Abu Muhamad Al-Adnani.  We have entrusted this aspect of our campaign to one of DoD’s most lethal, capable, and experienced commands, our Joint Special Operations Command, which helped deliver justice not only to Osama Bin Laden, but also to the man who founded the organization that became ISIL, Abu-Musab al-Zarqawi."
"Third, we’re also disrupting the flow of foreign fighters both to and from Iraq and Syria.  Here, as I discussed earlier, we’ve not only been supporting capable, motivated local forces in Syria that have retaken cities that were key transit hubs for foreign fighters in northern Syria, but we’ve also been supporting Turkish military operations intended to seal the border with Syria and prevent foreign fighters from exploiting that border to conduct attacks against our European allies and our homeland.  In recent months especially, our support of these operations has allowed us to gain new intelligence insights into ISIL’s networks of foreign fighters – networks we are determined to destroy.  In addition, we’ve worked with our coalition partners in a standing task force located in the region that looks at publically-available information and cross-checks it against our government’s various databases to identify potential ISIL cells and foreign fighter facilitation networks.  This is part of a broader effort within our coalition to not only stem the flow of foreign fighters, but also to counter ISIL’s online messaging, recruitment, and the spread of its loathsome ideology."
Going Forward in the Counter-ISIL Campaign
"Looking to the future, the collapse of ISIL’s control over Raqqa and Mosul – which we’re confident our coalition will achieve – will put ISIL on an irreversible path to a lasting defeat.  But, even when the coalition wins this fight – and let there be no doubt that we will – there will still be much more to do.  There will be towns to rebuild, services to reestablish, and communities to restore.  Political challenges will remain.  So when that time comes, the international community must ensure that the Iraqi and Syrian people have what they need to hold, stabilize, and govern their own territory.  For that reason, the international coalition’s humanitarian, stabilization, and governance efforts cannot be allowed to lag behind our military progress. "
"Additionally, we must ensure that ISIL isn’t able to take root in other parts of Iraq, and that the ISF and the Peshmerga are able to sustain the gains we’ve made with them.  Such progress is critical to making our partners’ gains enduring, and ensuring that ISIL, once defeated, stays defeated.  "
"Truly delivering ISIL a lasting defeat requires both strategic patience and strategic persistence.  Even when ISIL is defeated militarily, our coalition will still have work to do.  We can’t predict what will come afterward, so we must be ready for anything – including for any attempts by ISIL to remain relevant, even if only on the darkest corners of the Internet.  And we will continue to support our law enforcement, homeland security, and intelligence partners in helping protect our homeland and our people."
How Congress Can Help – Avoiding the Biggest Strategic Dangers to Defense
"Let me now turn to some issues that we in DoD face as an institution – not only in addressing the challenge posed by ISIL, but in addressing all of the five challenges I mentioned earlier, and ensuring our military’s continued unrivaled breadth and strength into the future – and how you can help.  "
"These issues are grave concerns to us that we see manifested in processes here in Congress, and they are threefold: the first is budget gridlock and instability; the second, micromanagement and over-regulation; and the third concern is the continued denial of needed reforms.  Instead of these, we need budget stability achieved through bipartisanship.  We need relief from over-regulation and micromanagement.  And we need more regard and respect for the considered judgment of DoD’s most senior military and civilian leaders."
"As you’ve heard from me and DoD senior leaders in meetings, messages, and conversations, these are serious concerns.  I could spend a lot of time focusing on each one, and I look forward to doing so when you return in November to work on passing an NDAA – hopefully one the President can sign.  But here, at this hearing, I want to focus on the first concern, since the fiscal year ends in eight days."
Avoiding Budget Instability and Gridlock
"We need Congress to come together around providing normal, stable, responsible budgets – that is, appropriations – because lack of stability represents one of the single biggest strategic risks to our DoD enterprise.  I’ve been talking to you for over a year and a half about the major risks posed by budget instability.  That was why I supported last fall’s bipartisan budget deal, and why DoD’s budget for FY 2017 reflected that deal.  Now the time has come to begin that fiscal year, and I can only tell you the same thing:  that budget instability is the greatest risk we face.  You heard the same from our Service Chiefs last week."
"Such instability is exactly the kind of dysfunction that undercuts stable planning and efficient use of taxpayer dollars – often in ways taxpayers can’t even see.  It makes planning for the fight extremely difficult for our warfighters and commanders, including in our campaign to deliver ISIL a lasting defeat.  It baffles our friends, and emboldens foes.  It’s managerially and strategically unsound, not to mention unfairly dispiriting to our troops and their families, and our workforce – all of whom deserve better, and deserve more predictability, to say the least.  Not only our people; our defense industry partners, too, need stability and longer-term plans to be as efficient and cutting-edge as we need them to be.  And even with the modicum of stability we got in last fall’s budget deal, we still face the greatest risk of all to DoD in the eyes of all of us in the leadership – a return to sequestration funding levels, with $100 billion in looming, automatic cuts beginning next year if this isn’t fixed.  Those cuts, as you heard last week, are a major concern for our Service Chiefs, and for me as well.  And I am concerned that the gimmickry we are seeing around defense funding this year will invite the return of sequestration rather than make it less likely – because it signals that bipartisan compromises are not respected."
"We’re now eight days away from the end of the fiscal year, but instead of stability, we’re going into FY 2017 with yet another continuing resolution (CR).  This will be the eighth fiscal year in a row that’s started with a continuing resolution.  That’s a deplorable state of affairs in itself, as this committee has made clear – and Chairman McCain, I appreciate your comments to our Service Chiefs about the damage a CR does to our institution, as I appreciate that this committee has been among the leaders in advocating for both the resources needed for defense and the timely appropriations we need to execute our mission."
"As you know and as you heard from the Chiefs last week, the longer a continuing resolution lasts, the more damaging it is – it makes the obvious mistake of having us do this year exactly what we did last year, despite the fact that we’re trying to evolve and innovate to stay ahead in a changing world.  It’s not just a matter of money, but where the dollars are.  For example, even a short-term CR slows our shipbuilding program, which is line appropriated, thereby preventing the Navy from moving forward on key programs and capabilities.  And it gets worse after three months – for example, the FY 2017 defense budget quadrupled funding for our European Reassurance Initiative in order to help deter Russian aggression, but a continuing resolution extending past December would undermine our ability to build up prepositioned stocks of equipment and warfighting gear in the countries of our NATO allies.  That would have great strategic consequences."
"If that weren’t enough, the risk of instability is only half my concern for DoD’s budget – the other is that our budget stability is also being subjected to risk through diversions of funds."
"As you know, last fall’s bipartisan budget deal set the size of our budget for FY 2017.  While there was a difference between what we got in the budget deal and what we had proposed in the year prior, we determined we could mitigate that difference and still meet our needs, so we accordingly submitted our defense budget to reflect the bipartisan budget deal.  Within a matter of months, however, some in Congress reintroduced instability by departing from the bipartisan budget deal and trying to come up with ways to go around it.  I cannot support these approaches, and I’d like to tell you why."
"In the first approach, the House is diverting $18 billion from our overseas operations funds at a time when we have troops deployed in Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan, and using the money for things DoD didn’t ask for and in many cases cannot afford to maintain and keep ready over time.  To do this – diverting warfighting funds at a time of war – is highly objectionable.  It harms the readiness of our troops in order to buy more force structure that we can’t afford to keep ready in the first place.  It could overtax DoD by up to $30 billion over the next five years, at the same time that we may be facing $100 billion in sequestration cuts.  It risks exacerbating our readiness challenges and creating hollow force structure.  And it threatens to unravel last fall’s bipartisan budget deal, again raising the specter of sequestration."
"If this is allowed to happen, there is no way I can tell a soldier, sailor, airman, or Marine who’s accelerating ISIL’s lasting defeat or deterring Russian aggression that we’re doing all we can for them here in Washington.  Not when Congress can’t pass timely appropriations.  And certainly not when Congress diverts defense dollars from what should be inviolable:  American troops deployed in harm’s way.  Those troops need to know that they’re getting every resource they need to accomplish their mission.  To take away from them goes too far – especially when emerging operational demands may soon require more resources than DoD initially budgeted for, not less.  "
"The backers of the House approach say they’re doing it to help our readiness, but it would actually have the opposite effect on readiness.  As you heard from the Service Chiefs last week and as you heard from me earlier in this testimony, nothing is more important to us than readiness, which is why it was the highest priority we had in preparing the 2017 defense budget – partly to rebuild full-spectrum readiness after 15 years of counterinsurgency operations, and partly to restore damage done to readiness over the last several years that was caused by the effects of sequestration cuts.  As the Chiefs made clear to you, the problems we’re fixing are different in each service – the Army needs time to put soldiers through full-spectrum brigade-level training rotations at its Combat Training Centers; for the Marine Corps, the issue is principally restoring readiness in aviation; for the Navy, it’s ship depot maintenance; and for the Air Force, it’s about maintaining readiness while remaining at a high operational tempo.  Each of these shows how restoring readiness is not just about money; it also requires time, which the Chiefs told you as well.  And all of this underscores why what the House seeks to do would actually hurt readiness:  because it risks the stability provided by last fall’s bipartisan budget deal, and it would actually give us higher end-strength for one year – that is, more people – whom we cannot afford to keep ready in the long-term."
"Others in Congress took a different approach, but I cannot support theirs either.  In this case, one of the defense appropriations committees cut high-priority investments that we should be making in high-end capabilities, and then spent more money on lower-priority things we didn’t ask for and already have enough of.  "
"While these cuts are less than $18 billion and do not take away from our warfighting funds, they still add up in ways that could seriously imperil our future strength.  For example, this committee chose to gut funding for undersea drones – crippling our efforts to leverage unmanned technology to ensure our forces’ global freedom of action and delivery of new payloads despite other nations’ attempts to deny access to certain operating areas.  They cut proven programs like the submarine-hunting P-8, a maritime patrol aircraft that prevents adversaries from using modern undersea technologies against us.  They made significant cuts to some of our highest-priority electronic warfare systems, the Next-Generation Jammer and the Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program – handicapping our planes’ future airborne electronic attack capabilities, and leaving our surface ships more vulnerable to advanced missile threats.  They cut the critical core out of advanced munitions programs needed to increase our Navy’s lethality – both the maritime-strike version of the Tomahawk  cruise missile, and the new, highly-lethal anti-ship mode for one of our most modern and capable munitions, the SM-6  missile.  And on top of that, committees in both the House and Senate made cuts to critical defense innovation spearheads that we need to maintain our military’s technological edge and counter some of the most vexing threats we face – taking away funding from our Strategic Capabilities Office, our partnership with In-Q-Tel, and our tech startup, the Defense Innovation Unit-Experimental (DIUx)."
"Now, I don’t believe there was ill-will here, but these were cuts to investments highly prioritized by DoD’s senior military and civilian leaders, substituting lower-priority spending we didn’t ask for.  And we oppose each of them, because they undermine our preparations to counter and stay ahead of our competitors’ technological advances.  I’ve seen the constant temptation over the years to starve new and future-oriented defense investments in favor of more established and therefore well-entrenched programs.  In a rapidly changing and competitive world, we must resist this temptation."
"Rather than funding these investments in lethality and innovation that were among our highest priorities for sharpening our military edge and staying ahead of our adversaries, Congress wants instead to buy things like an extra Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), which we didn’t request.  These ships have important uses, but we already bought 26, with 14 more on the way, and we do not need more.  We have much greater needs:  we need the undersea drones, advanced munitions, electronic warfare capabilities, P-8s, and innovation initiatives these measures would cut."
"Of course, there are other proposals which again do not comport with last fall’s bipartisan budget deal.  Having rejected the two approaches I just discussed, I also have to say – as you’ve heard me emphasize for the last year and a half – that I cannot support any third approach that moves us toward sequestration, or that moves us away from bipartisanship.  Not at the expense of budget stability.  Not if it shortchanges the needs of our warfighters.  Not if it means funding lower priorities instead of higher priorities.  Not if it undermines confidence in the ability to pass bipartisan budget deals, which could lead to the imposition of sequestration’s $100 billion in looming, automatic cuts.  And not if it adds extra force structure that we cannot afford to keep ready in the long-term and that would only lead to a hollow force."
Conclusion – The Need for Bipartisan Budget Stability
"I appreciate that this committee didn’t follow either of those two approaches, but as conference negotiations continue, I must emphasize that what we need most is stability – it’s critical in order for DoD and our people to address all the national security challenges we face."
"I am confident, and hopeful, that we can come back together again.  Today, America is fortunate to have the world’s strongest, most capable, most innovative military.  I know it, you know it, our friends and allies know it, and critically, our potential adversaries know it too.  Only with your help can we ensure that my successors can say the same, and that what is today the finest fighting force the world has ever known remains that way for years and generations to come."

“The Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative program, or MURI, supports research by funding teams of investigators that include more than one traditional science and engineering discipline in order to accelerate the research progress,” said Dale Ormond, Principal Director for Research, in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering.  According to Ormond, most of the program’s efforts involve researchers from multiple academic institutions and academic departments.  “MURI awards also support the education and training of graduate students in cutting-edge research areas, Ormond stated. "
"The highly competitive MURI program complements other DoD basic research initiatives that support traditional, three year, single-investigator university research grants.  By supporting multidisciplinary teams with larger, longer awards in carefully chosen and relevant research topics, DoD and the Services enhance the potential for significant and sustained advancement of research in critical areas of importance to National Security and the DoD’s mission."
"The Army Research Office, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, and the Office of Naval Research solicited proposals in 24 topic areas important to the DoD and the Services.  In response to the initial solicitation the department received 436 white papers.  After two rounds of merit-based reviews, a panel of DoD scientists and experts narrowed the proposals to 100 from which the 24 final awards were selected.  Based on the proposals selected in the competition, 64 U.S. academic institutions are expected to participate in the 2018 MURI program.  In addition, this year, for the first time, Australia has funded research teams to work together with two U.S. MURI teams.  This cooperation is in line with the Secretary of Defense’s direction to strengthen our alliances, and collaborate whenever and wherever possible."
"Over the past 30 years, DoD’s MURI program resulted in significant capabilities for our military forces and opened up entirely new lines of research.  Notable examples include foundations in the fabrication of nanoscale and microscale structures by the processes of self-assembled materials (SAM) and microcontact printing, the integration of vision algorithms with sensors to create low-power, low-latency, compact adaptive vision systems, and advances in fully optical data control and switching.  These and other important technological advances from the MURI program have impact on current and future military capabilities."

"Good morning, gang. Good morning, every one.  "
Let me start by saying how great it is to be in San Diego.  And I appreciate that this beautiful city here has been a community that’s welcomed our military for many years.  We don’t take it for granted.  And we’re grateful to you.  Thank you. 
"Where’d Mike go?  Here we are…on no, no, please sit down.  Thank you, Mike.  One of the many ways Mike has given me help over the long time we’ve known each other.  You all are lucky to have Mike in command out here.  Secretary of Defense isn’t a bad title but “Air Boss” is a great title.  And he does a very good job of it."
"Also, Doug Verissimo, Doug, V8, your Captain.  But I’m here to talk to you, all of you, the sailors of the Carl Vinson.  First to thank you for everything you do every day. And then to say something about the strategic meaning of what you’re accomplishing for our nation and our world here."
"For over three decades, the men and women of the Gold Eagle have done what is the noblest thing a person – each and every one of you – can do with your lives, which is defend our great country and make a better world for our children.  And today, you – and the rest of what is the finest fighting force the world has ever known, America’s – are addressing squarely the five major, immediate, evolving challenges we face as a nation in our security. "
"First, we’re countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe.  We’re managing historic change in the Asia-Pacific…more on that in a moment, where China is rising, which is fine, but sometimes behaving aggressively, which is not.  Indeed, we’re also strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s continued nuclear and missile provocations.  We’re checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Gulf, and protecting our friends and allies in the Middle East.  And every day, and as we sit here right now, we’re accelerating the certain defeat of ISIL, destroying the fact and the idea that there can be a state based upon this evil ideology, first in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, and everywhere it metastasizes around the world, even as we continue to help protect our people here in at home.  "
"Now, today, I want to speak with you about our strategy with respect to what is the single most consequential region for America’s future: which is the Asia-Pacific.  And I want to echo what the Air Boss said a moment ago, which is what we all believe: your mission here is critically important to our country, to our security and that of our friends and allies. "
"I spent the past couple of days with some of the thousands of men and women, military and civilian, who contribute to our nuclear deterrence mission.  And I’ll tell you the same thing I told them: even if your mission – whether it’s at a missile silo in North Dakota or on an aircraft carrier in what is today the relatively peaceful Asia-Pacific – isn’t in the headlines everyday –as I see it, we’re in real trouble when what you do gets in the headlines – your mission here is one of fundamental strategic importance to our country, and that it’s not in the headlines is a tribute to your success – we need you to keep it that way.  Remember: this region, with half of humanity, half of the world’s economy, is the single most consequential region for America’s future – and indeed for the world’s. "
"Indeed, the rebalance to the Asia-Pacific, which President Obama announced five years ago, is a critical national commitment.  It includes diplomatic, economic, and military components all to ensure – at a time of dramatic political, economic, and security change in the region – that the Asia-Pacific remains a place where every nation can rise and prosper.  "
"To do that, as all of you know, nations are going to need security.  People can’t have all the other things that make life meaningful if they’re not safe.  That’s essential for the Asia-Pacific’s continued progress.  And that’s our charge – and your charge.  DoD’s component of the rebalance – the work you and your fellow American servicemembers carry out with strength, commitment, and principle  – will help this dynamic region realize its potential in that principled future.  "
"The good news is, we don’t have to do this alone.  We’re strong, but we also have many friends, partners, and allies in the region – part of a burgeoning principled and inclusive security network in the Asia-Pacific.  This afternoon, I’m flying on to Hawaii to meet with ten of those partners, my counterparts from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, to discuss how we’re partnering together in new ways to ensure security and stability in that vital corner of the cast Asia-Pacific. "
"So before I depart, I want to remind you – who are at the center of everything out here, and at the center of all our minds back in Washington – about all that DoD is doing to operationalize the rebalance – to ensure we have the people, payloads, platforms, the war plans, and the partners to continue bolstering security in the region for decades to come.  And I also want to share with you the first steps we’ll be taking – that you’ll be taking – in the next phase, the next phase, of the rebalance, our third, to catalyze the Asia-Pacific’s principled and inclusive security network and ensure the Asia-Pacific remains a region where every nation can rise and prosper."
"That’s been America’s objective and America’s practice since World War II.  In fact, tomorrow I’ll host the Southeast Asian defense ministers aboard the U.S.S. Missouri.  The “Mighty Mo,” as it’s called, is most famous for being the site 71 years ago this month of the signing ceremony that ended World War II.  At the end of the session, General Douglas MacArthur, who presided over the ceremony, said, “Let us pray that peace be now restored to the world, and that God will preserve it always.”"
"With that prayer, and in the decades since, millions of American men and women serving in uniform across the Asia-Pacific have helped restore the region and preserve its stability.  Every port call and every flight hour, every exercise and operation, and every soldier, sailor, airman, and Marine has made important contributions to the Asia-Pacific’s security.  Those Americans – including all of you – have also helped uphold and defend important principles, like resolving disputes peacefully; ensuring countries can make choices free from external coercion and intimidation; and preserving the freedom of overflight and navigation guaranteed by international law."
"And we’ve seen how U.S.-enabled security and these principles have helped countries throughout the region make incredible progress.  Think about it… first Japan, then Taiwan, South Korea, Southeast Asia, rose and prospered, and today, China and India do the same.  That progress has produced incredible changes in the region: populations are growing, education has improved, freedom and self-determination have taken hold, economies are becoming more interconnected, and military spending is increasing.  "
"Amid all this remarkable change and progress, America’s objectives in the Asia-Pacific have endured since that day on the Missouri: we still want peace, stability, and progress in the Asia-Pacific.  But as the region has changed, our approach has had to change along with it.  That’s why five years ago President Obama announced in Australia that the United States was going to launch the rebalance, to quote him, “play a larger and long-term role in shaping this region and its future.”  "
"That last word – future – is important.  The rebalance is about the future.  With it, we’re not trying to stop or rewind the clock in the Asia-Pacific, for we know that in the decades after World War II, amid the region’s ruins and unhealed wounds dating back to that war and even to the decades before, not every nation got the opportunity to fully realize its potential.  That legacy – along with the region’s many internal rifts and historical tensions of which you’re very familiar – must be overcome.  And the great nations and peoples of the Asia-Pacific must each be able to realize their full potential. "
"The rebalance is an investment in the region’s future – it will help the Asia-Pacific unlock its tremendous promise and to build a brighter future.  And that’s good for the United States.  For example, the United States wants to reinforce the open and inclusive economic approach that we all know can continue to benefit the region.  That’s why one of the most important non-military initiatives of the rebalance is the Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP, which will bind the United States more closely together with 11 other economies, guarantee a high-quality, high-standard trade system, and support more U.S. exports and higher-paying American jobs.  For those reasons, and its strategic value, TPP is an opportunity the region and the United States cannot afford to miss."
"Unfortunately, challenges always accompany opportunities in times of change.  Today in the Asia-Pacific, there are a number of security challenges, including North Korea, which, with its nuclear saber-rattling, continues to threaten our allies and heighten tensions in the region.  There are also challenges to the shared principles we’ve long helped uphold.  For example, maritime concerns in the East and South China Seas, the Indian Ocean, and elsewhere pose a risk to the region’s prosperous future.  Terrorism and other transnational threats spare no region of the globe.  "
"As we support these principles, the United States will continue to stand with our allies and partners, and we will – as we have demonstrated and as we will continue to demonstrate – fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows."
"With the military component of the rebalance, the United States will help the region to meet these challenges and to remain the primary mainstay of security in the Asia-Pacific.  The men and women of the Defense Department, including all of you, have pursued each phase of the rebalance with strength, commitment, and inclusion. "
"In the first phase beginning five years ago, DoD quantitatively and geographically enhanced the U.S. military’s force posture in this vast region.  After years of emphasis on counterterrorism and wars in the Middle East, which we needed to pay attention to, and in light of the regional changes since the end of the Cold War, we made a choice to strengthen our posture in the Asia-Pacific to make it more robust, as well as more geographically distributed, more operationally resilient, and politically sustainable in the region.  "
"That’s why DoD sent tens of thousands of additional American personnel to the region.  That’s why we committed to homeporting 60 percent of our naval and overseas air assets in the Asia-Pacific by 2020.  That’s why we began to modernize our footprint in Japan and the Republic of Korea.  And that’s why we began to realign our Marines from a highly-centralized presence in Okinawa, Japan, to additional locations in Australia, Hawaii, and Guam – the latter serving as a strategic hub."
"In the second phase of DoD’s rebalance, which we launched last year, we’ve made qualitative improvements to our force posture – upgrading our own military capabilities – while at the same time also modernizing and advancing our defense relationships to reflect regional change and new opportunities. "
"The second phase’s force posture improvements included sending our best people – sailors like you – and assigning our most advanced capabilities to the Asia-Pacific, including F-22 and F-35 stealth fighter jets, P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft, continuous deployments of strategic bombers, and our newest surface warfare vessels, including all of our newest stealth destroyers, the DDG-1000.  We also continued making strategic and substantial investments in new capabilities critical to the rebalance, like not only growing the overall number of surface ships but also making each of them much more lethal, and investing more in Virginia-class submarines and in areas like cyber.  And we developed new and innovative strategies and operational concepts, which we put to use in more complex and expansive training exercises – both on our own and with our allies and partners – none larger than this summer’s RIMPAC."
"Also in the second phase, we sought to modernize America’s relationships with militaries across the region.  These are ties that have been nurtured over decades, tested in crisis, and built on shared interests, values, and sacrifice.  But they also need to evolve to reflect growing capabilities, new national aspirations, and changing security needs.  "
You can see the breadth and depth of this modernization…starting with our allies. 
"The U.S.-Japan alliance, to begin with, remains the cornerstone of Asia-Pacific security.  And with our new Defense Guidelines, the U.S.-Japan alliance has never been stronger, or more capable of contributing to security in the region and beyond.  "
"Our alliance with the Republic of Korea also continues to evolve, to assure deterrence on the Korean peninsula…including through the joint decision earlier this year to deploy the THAAD ballistic missile defense system to the Republic of Korea to help defend against North Korean threats there.  "
"Meanwhile, the U.S.-Australia alliance is, more and more, a global one.  As our two nations partner together across the Asia-Pacific, we’re also together accelerating the defeat of ISIL in Iraq and Syria.  "
Our long-standing alliance with Thailand goes back to the 19th century and continues to benefit both countries and contribute to regional security.
"And as it has been for decades, our alliance with the Philippines is ironclad.  And through the landmark Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, or EDCA, the United States is supporting the modernization of the Philippine Armed Forces.  "
"Next, America’s regional partnerships are growing in number and strength."
"The U.S.-India military relationship is the closest it’s ever been.  Great nation, large, democracy.  Through our strategic handshake – with America reaching west in the rebalance, and India reaching east in what Prime Minister Modi calls  his Act East policy – our two nations are exercising together by air, land, and sea – never did that before.  And there’s also a technological handshake – the U.S.-India Defense Technology and Trade Initiative, or DTTI, grasps hands with Prime Minister Modi’s Make in India campaign – helping our countries move toward more diverse defense co-development and co-production of weapons systems."
"Meanwhile, the U.S.-Singapore relationship continues to grow, with Singapore’s hosting of American littoral combat ships and P-8 maritime patrol aircraft."
"The U.S.-Vietnam partnership has also been dramatically strengthened.  The United States lifted the ban on lethal weapons sales to Vietnam recently to provide Vietnam greater access to the military equipment it needs and wants.  In fact, today, right as we speak, right here the U.S.S. John McCain – named after the father of Senator John McCain, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee – is visiting Vietnam as we speak.  I spoke with Senator McCain just yesterday about the historical significance of this visit. "
"And notably, the American and New Zealand militaries have taken an important step forward, as later this fall a U.S. Navy destroyer will make the first American port call in New Zealand in 30 years."
"And, in the second phase, we’ve also started to connect – and network – these allies and partners together.  A good example is our Maritime Security Initiative, which we launched last year.  It represents an initial $425-million-dollar, five-year, American commitment to enable a regional maritime security network in Southeast Asia.  More than simply providing hardware, this initiative helps the United States enable the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand to connect and work with each other – and us – so they can all see more, share more, and do more to ensure maritime security throughout the vital waters of Southeast Asia."
"Now, given our inclusive approach, DoD is also taking steps to modernize our military-to-military relationship with China.  In recent years, we’ve strengthened communications between our two militaries and reduced the risk of miscalculations that could lead to crises.  We’ve recently concluded two confidence-building measures, one on maritime rules of behavior and another on crisis communications.  We also regularly participate together in multilateral exercises, such as RIMPAC, that demonstrate the value of working together to address security issues.  And our two militaries also hold regular dialogues and high-level consultations that seek to minimize misunderstanding.   "
"Now, the United States still has serious concerns with some of China’s recent actions on the seas, in cyberspace, and elsewhere.  Beijing sometimes appears to want to pick and choose which principles it wants to benefit from and which it prefers to try to undercut.  For example, the universal right to freedom of navigation that allows China’s ships and aircraft to transit safely and peacefully is the same right that Beijing criticizes other countries for exercising in the region.  But principles are not like that.  They apply to everyone, and to every nation, equally. "
"As President Obama has said, the U.S.-China relationship will have elements of cooperation but also competition.  We hope that China chooses to join the rest of the region in strengthening and upholding the shared principles that have helped so many nations around the region, including China, to rise and to prosper.  "
"In the third phase of the rebalance, we’ll cement the progress we’ve made in the first and second phases, and build upon it…first, by continuing to qualitatively upgrade and invest in our regional force posture with sustained and strategic investments, which I’ll describe in a moment and second, by catalyzing the Asia-Pacific’s principled and inclusive security network even more."
"In this next phase, the United States will continue to sharpen our military edge so we remain the most powerful military in the region and the security partner of choice.  We’re already sending our best people and platforms into the region, and in the rebalance’s third phase, we’ll increase and target investments to ensure they – and all of you – stay the best.  "
"Here are some of the path-breaking, and high-tech improvements we’re making beginning in this budget this year: "
"We’re going to have a few more surprises as well.  These “leap-ahead” investments will keep us ahead in the Asia-Pacific, and elsewhere.  I can’t share all the details on these for obvious reasons, but what our friends and our potential adversaries – and all of you – should know is that these new capabilities will help us keep our decades-old commitment to undergirding security in the Asia-Pacific, strong and unchallengeable  These advancements may change how we operate, they will, but they’ll never change why we do so: for the security for our people, for our friends and allies, and they principles that have benefited so many in the region for so long."
"As we make these investments in our military edge, we’ll also catalyze the Asia-Pacific’s growing principled and inclusive security network.  Unlike elsewhere in the world, think about this, peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific has never been managed by a region-wide, formal structure like NATO has in Europe.  That’s because the Asia-Pacific is so different, with its unique history, geography, and politics, and accordingly bilateral relationships, one country to another, have instead been  the mainstay of military cooperation in the region. "
"And yet, as the Asia-Pacific continues to change, as it faces opportunities and challenges, as it becomes more interconnected politically and economically, the region’s militaries are increasingly coming together in new ways, and thereby creating, gradually, a security network  that’s principled and inclusive.  "
"We’re finding more and more every day– we in the United States are finding more every day —that nations in the Asia-Pacific see future opportunities to improve their militaries and their security, and they’re increasingly coming to us to partner.  And we also find more and more that they have concerns about the future – aggression and coercion, terrorism, and transnational threats, even natural disasters – and once again we experience a growing demand for American posture and American partnership.  Meeting this demand and fueling this vision is the other big part of the third phase of the rebalance.  "
"The result is the steady growth of a principled and inclusive security network.  It’s grounded in the principles – like freedom of navigation and overflight – that our countries have collectively promoted and upheld for decades.  And it’s inclusive since any nation and any military – no matter its capability, budget, or experience – can contribute.  Everyone gets a voice, and no one is excluded…and by the way, that includes China, and its military, and we hope China doesn’t exclude itself. "
"The principled and inclusive security network is not a formal alliance, nor is it an effort to contain or isolate any one.  Rather, it’s a way for the United States, all of our allies, partners, and friends, and others in the region to connect, cooperate, and contribute to regional security and to uphold shared principles."
This network’s been developing in several ways.  
"First, trilateral mechanisms are bringing together trios of allies and partners that previously worked together only bilaterally.  This might seem like a small thing, but if you know the history out here, it’s not.  For example, the U.S.-Japan-Republic of Korea, two great allies of ours with which we’ve worked for many decades with each individually, now willing to work together with us.  That partnership helps us coordinate responses, very importantly, to North Korean nuclear and missile provocations.  And for the very first time, our three nations conducted a trilateral ballistic missile warning exercise earlier this summer."
"Second, beyond their relationships involving the United States, many countries within the Asia-Pacific are coming together on their own by establishing bilateral and trilateral mechanisms.  For example, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines recently agreed to coordinated trilateral maritime patrols to counter piracy, organized crime, and terrorist activity in the Sulu Sea.  This is a good thing on its own, but it’s also an important step for this developing network and the region. "
"And third, even more broadly, regional nations are developing a networked, multilateral regional security architecture – from one end of the region to the other – with, as a central example, the ASEAN Defense Ministers Meeting-Plus.  Tomorrow, as I mentioned, my ASEAN defense counterparts and I will gather in Hawaii to discuss regional challenges.  This is the second such informal dialogue the United States has hosted, and we’re going to reflect on our shared interests and principles and identify new ways to partner together to further realize them. "
"And of course, every security network needs networkers – nations, people, and militaries to enable it.  So even as we respond to these five challenges I talked about earlier all around the world, which only the United States has the strength to do, the U.S. Defense Department is also enabling the Asia-Pacific principled and inclusive security network to help networked militaries to do more with us, together, and on their own.  "
"So we’ll play our part, including in some specific ways.  American personnel postured throughout the region – in Australia, on Guam, and elsewhere – will deploy more often to operate with both their American colleagues and their regional counterparts.  That’ll help us solidify military-to-military relationships, strengthen security cooperation, and enhance deterrence.  These deployments and our investments will also improve interoperability so that our militaries can work with and off of the same platforms.  And, the exercises we’ve held for years, and intensified in phase two of the rebalance, will also grow more frequent and complex.  And we’re going to supply the resources to make it so."
"DoD also appreciates that many of our U.S. government partners have their own rebalance initiatives, and each offers new opportunities to work together in this vital region.  So for example, we’ll increase the U.S. Coast Guard’s engagement with our ASEAN partners.  And along with the State Department, we’ll weave together our security assistance programs in the Asia-Pacific so we can boost the capabilities of our allies and partners and the security network, while making them more interoperable.  "
"All of these efforts demonstrate how DoD will continue to pursue – on our own and with our partners at home and in the region – new ways ensure security in the Asia-Pacific.  One possibility is in cyber.  Because the network is so rich with nations with cyber expertise, including Japan, Korea, India, Singapore, as each of our countries develop their cyber capabilities, we can learn from each other and cooperate together in this important domain. "
"In total, the third phase of the rebalance and the principled and inclusive security network will improve how we – and all of you – ensure regional security and uphold principles in the years ahead.  For example, after a future typhoon, we may see an Australian P-8 with Singaporean personnel aboard coordinate with an American destroyer in search and rescue operations.  And freedom of navigation may also be upheld, in part, by joint – and networked – patrols, as networked navies and air forces fly, sail, and operate together everywhere that international law allows…to ensure the region’s waterways remain safe and open."
"And of course – and this is what I want to conclude with – the key to all of this…to the third phase of the rebalance, is all of you.  You, and your fellow soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines will solidify the rebalance, you will make this network work, and you will help the Asia-Pacific – once again, the single most consequential region for America’s future and the world – realize a principled and peaceful and prosperous future.  And play the role only America can play. "
"You’ll do so with strength.  After all, you’re part of the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  There’s no one stronger, no one more capable, no one more innovative…because our military edge is second-to-none.  And it will be, it will be so, as far into the future as I can see.  Because through our rebalance to the Asia-Pacific, we’re making investments to ensure you stay the best and the United States remains the region’s strongest military.  "
"You’ll do so with commitment and the commitment of the entire Defense Department and entire nation at your backs.  Each part – economic, political, and military – and each phase of the rebalance has been a commitment to realizing the Asia-Pacific’s principled future.  As you carry out the rebalance’s third phase, you’re not only answering your nation’s call and ensuring the United States meets this commitment; you’re also meeting the call of our regional allies and partners. "
"And most important, you’ll do so with principle.  That’s who we are as a country, and it’s who you are as a military.  You’re our best networkers.  You’re why we have so many friends and partner.  It’s not an accident.  Because you are not only immensely skilled and capable, but you embody the principles that have helped so many in the Asia-Pacific already to rise and prosper – inspiring, cooperating, including, representing the principles that others value, other people want, and working with our allies and partners to ensure a better world.  That reputation of yours makes me proud.  "
"With your strength, commitment, and inclusion, and your contributions to the rebalance’s third phase, you’re carrying on a pretty rich heritage: one passed from those who served on the Missouri seven decades ago, to those who serve on the Vinson here today.  From those who served in the Asia-Pacific in World War II and the Cold War, to those of the post 9/11 era.  And from those who’ve worked on the rebalance’s first and second phases to those who will execute its third phase and its future phases.  In this, you will help realize the prayer MacArthur spoke 71 years ago this month – you will help preserve peace, stability, and progress.  And in so doing, you will keep our country safe, and ensure the Asia-Pacific remains a region where everyone can rise and prosper."
Thank you.  Keep it up.  Your country is behind you.  I’m 100 percent behind you.

Good evening.
I want to thank Secretary Fallon for his kind introduction. And I want to thank the 
United Kingdom for hosting this important – and first of its kind – United Nations Peacekeeping Defense Ministerial.
"Earlier today at Oxford University, I spoke with students about how, in a changing world, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other like-minded nations must continue to stand together and stand up for the values and the principled international order that have, for decades, helped make a better world."
"In Prime Minister May and Defense Secretary Fallon, the UK has leaders who are committed to doing so; their hosting this conference is just one example of that commitment. And for all of us, they are good friends and the right partners at a time of great change in the world."
"I’m pleased to be here this evening with so many of the United States’ – and my own – friends, allies, and partners. Many of us have grown up together over our years in the international defense community…working together to protect our people and make a better world for our children."
"Of course, it’s a very rare occasion to gather this many Defense Ministers in one room. And there are two important reasons why so many of us are here. First is the United Nations. My friend Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon, who could not be here this week, Under Secretary Generals Ladsous and Khare, and their teams have worked with each of our nations to increase the potential and the power of UN peace operations. "
"And the second reason we’re here is that we believe in the importance of UN Peacekeeping and the value of peace operations. We do so for humanitarian reasons, but also because, as defense officials, we appreciate that it is more efficient and effective to prevent the development of serious dangers, rather than confronting them later on."
"We’ve learned that lesson time and again, sometimes the hard way, from the aftermath of World War II right up through to today. And we must remember it at a time of global change and instability, when the need for and importance of peace operations will only grow."
"Today’s world requires our brave peacekeepers to take real but necessary risks to help end, and, most importantly, prevent conflict. That is why it’s imperative that all our nations and militaries contribute more to these operations, and that we improve how we conduct them. I’d like to speak with you tonight about both those important efforts, and about the contributions the United States is making to UN Peacekeeping."
"Of course, we’re having this conversation at a time and in a security environment that, like so much else in our lives, is rapidly changing. Indeed, thanks to the work of many of your nations and militaries and your adherence to the principles I mentioned earlier, the people of the world have generally grown healthier, freer, richer, and safer over the past 75 years. And the world has become more prosperous and dynamic as a result. All that change – economic, political, military, social, and technological…personal and national…regional and global – has produced many opportunities for our nations, but it has also created challenges and crises as well."
"As so, today, the U.S. Defense Department, which I lead and represent here, is focused on five immediate, major, evolving challenges."
"In Europe, the Defense Department is standing with America’s NATO allies and taking a strong and balanced approach to deter Russian aggression while also leaving the door open to working with Russia where our shared interests align. In the vital Asia-Pacific region, the U.S. military is a committed partner in building a principled and inclusive security network of nations, many of whom are represented here, to ensure every nation in that dynamic region – every nation – can continue to rise and prosper. Meanwhile, the Defense Department is also strengthening its deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s nuclear and missile provocations. The U.S. military is also checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Gulf, all while standing with friends and allies in the region. And, the Defense Department is continuing to counter and defeat terrorism – in particular, accelerating the certain and lasting defeat of ISIL in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, and everywhere it metastasizes around the world."
"Many of your nations are helping meet these challenges, particularly that last one. And on behalf of the United States, I thank you for your commitment and contributions to the counter-ISIL campaign. I convened the Defense Ministerial of the Counter-ISIL Coalition for the very first time last year, and we united around a campaign plan which we are systematically executing. Since then and thanks to the contributions and sacrifices of our local partners in Iraq,
Syria, and elsewhere and servicemembers from across this coalition, our campaign has accelerated, pressuring and squeezing ISIL, and rolling it back towards Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria."
"The challenge posed by ISIL demonstrates how small, local insurrections can grow into global threats: endangering innocent civilians at the source, and widening to threaten the people and homelands of many of our nations. And today, with several places – fragile and conflict affected states – where local dangers might grow into global threats, the importance of UN Peacekeeping and the demand for it are understandably growing."
"But peacekeeping itself is also changing in this new era….growing more difficult, demanding, and dangerous and its missions more far-reaching. Like many of you, I’ve seen that progression over the course of my own career – from the 1970s and 80s when the Cold War still cast a shadow over peacekeeping in interstate conflict…through the 1990s, when tragedies in Rwanda and Bosnia shamed the world into transforming how we make and keep peace…to the
missions in the current era, where our ambitions and our peacekeepers’ skills are being tested more and more in intrastate conflicts with, between, and among non-state actors."
"Decades ago, peacekeepers were typically sent to permissive environments to monitor an agreed-upon peace between warring parties. As you all know, today’s peacekeepers confront ruthless groups and violent extremists who flout the laws of war and who are fighting in more ways and in more domains than ever before. Indeed, today’s peacekeepers serve in some of the most dangerous parts of the world, and make tremendous sacrifices, including many who make the ultimate sacrifice."
"What’s more, decades ago, peacekeepers served mostly to keep adversaries separated. Now their assignments run the gamut from facilitating peace agreements and protecting civilians to stopping violence and preventing atrocities – sometimes all the way to countering insurgencies. Today’s fast-moving and dangerous missions also require quick and effective decisions…often about the use of force…and often made, if not amid the fog of war than amid the fog of an uncertain peace."
"And, we’ve also seen that making peace today is only the start, for the UN and for operations like our counter-ISIL campaign. To make peace lasting – to make it stick – we must also enable sustainable progress. When the fighting stops, we must collaborate with all of our partners – diplomatic and economic, law enforcement and civilian, international and local – to help communities and nations transition and recover from conflict. That’s the linchpin to lasting peace and security."
"It’s clear that peacekeeping in the modern world will require more of our peacekeepers, our missions, and our operations leaders. But it will also require more of each of us in this room, and the militaries we have the honor and responsibility to lead. We all must make additional contributions, and make important improvements to UN Peacekeeping."
"For its part, the United States – even as it’s responding to the five challenges I mentioned earlier, and underwriting stability and security in every region across the globe – is continuing America’s longstanding, robust financial support for UN peacekeeping. Contributing over $2 billion dollars in 2016, the United States is the largest financial contributor to UN peacekeeping operations."
"At the historic Leaders’ Summit that President Obama convened last year, the U.S. made nine additional commitments. And I have made it a priority in the Pentagon to implement those that require the action of the Defense Department, as have Secretary of State John Kerry and UN Ambassador Samantha Power in their respective domains."
"In the spirit of the Michael Fallon’s purpose in convening this summit, let me now offer you a progress report on what the Defense Department has done to make good on President Obama’s commitments."
"First, the United States has been finalizing plans to double the number of senior and seasoned American military officers – working with the UN to place some 40 officers with specific skills in planning and logistics and other important areas – that will serve in UN peace operations."
"Second, through a new logistical support framework, the U.S. government is able to rapidly provide critical capabilities – like airlift – to UN operations, as we provided parachutes used to airdrop food aid into Syria earlier this year."
"Third, the United States has also successfully worked with the UN to identify field-tested technologies to solve critical operational challenges, including an interoperable radio system to support communications, as well as the geo-spatial software tool GeoShape and the handheld device Arbiter that support improved situational awareness and decision-making."
"Fourth, America is training troop contributing countries to counter improvised explosive devices, or IEDs."
"Fifth, the United States is training UN staff to develop and conduct table-top exercises to prepare senior mission leaders – and the UN’s staff has successfully conducted two in-mission exercises so far."
"And sixth, the Defense Department has finalized our policies and procedures, and now stands ready to provide engineering support to UN peace operations."
"In addition to meeting last year’s commitments, the United States and the Defense Department are committed to leveraging more than a decade of hard-earned operational experience in austere and dangerous environments to improve the military and operational components of peace operations. So today, I’m proud to announce that the United States is pledging to make additional contributions to UN peacekeeping in five areas."
"First, to help develop competent and effective senior mission leaders for peace operations, the Defense Department is offering to help train, develop, and prepare future leaders by reinforcing the UN’s Enhanced Leader Development Program."
"Next, to bring an end to sexual exploitation and abuse by peacekeepers, the Defense Department – leveraging our own recent experience trying to rid our force of the scourge of sexual assault – is offering to help enable the UN’s National Investigative Officers and improve training to prevent sexual exploitation and other conduct and discipline issues."
"Additionally, to help the UN peace operations predict, plan, and secure the capabilities they need in the field, the Defense Department is offering to help synchronize capability development efforts, especially to help fill critical gaps such as counter-IED operations and
medical evacuation."
"Furthermore, to help UN and troop contributing countries more rapidly deploy units to crisis zones, the Defense Department will leverage our own unique capabilities and recent operational experience to help peacekeepers get on the ground – and get working – more quickly."
"And finally, to optimize operational and environmental designs for UN Peacekeeping camps and sites, the Defense Department will partner with the UN to improve energy, water, and waste management efficiency.
Taken together, these new commitments, along with last year’s, and our ongoing financial support for UN peacekeeping, demonstrate the priority that President Obama, I, and the entire U.S. government place on peace operations."
"And I’m here to ask each of you, and your defense institutions, to continue to prioritize it as well. Many nations here tonight have already pledged to contribute additional uniformed personnel and enablers; we applaud your commitment and honor your sacrifices. Thank you for your efforts to deliver these pledges as rapidly as possible. And thank you for looking for additional ways to contribute to this important cause."
"As we all know, however, new troops, equipment, and support to UN Peacekeeping can only do so much on their own. That’s why we also need to look at – and be honest about – where our operations and peacekeepers have fallen short, and to take steps to improve the diversity, leadership, accountability, and performance of our peace operations."
"UN forces have grown, and the numbers and diversity of contributing nations is now increasing too. That’s a good thing, as is the increasing role of women peacekeepers. After all, there are some missions and some communities, particularly those with at-risk populations, where women peacekeepers are uniquely positioned to advance peace and security. That’s why having more women peacekeepers is something all of us should strive for because it will both
improve the effectiveness of peace operations and allow us to draw from the widest possible pool of talent that meets our mission standards. And I applaud this ministerial’s focus on the importance of women in peacekeeping."
"We also have to make some critical reforms to UN Peacekeeping. While this is indeed a dangerous time for peacekeepers, each of us knows from the experiences of our own militaries, difficult missions and dangerous environments do not excuse poor performance, sexual exploitation and abuse, or other unacceptable behavior."
"UN Peacekeeping has great potential, and together, with important, achievable reforms, we can make it as effective as the world needs it to be. So, as I see it, here’s where we all need to focus:"
"First, as we know from our own militaries, meritocracy works and improves mission effectiveness. That’s why we must select qualified leaders of peace operations missions, and empower them to more effectively manage their forces in complex, austere, and dangerous environments."
"Second, while each contributing nation must hold its own people accountable, the UN must also ensure the leaders of peace operations and their forces are rigorously assessed against clear standards for their performance, equipment, and conduct. That means consistently underperforming units must be sent home and replaced by someone more committed to the task."
"And third, we must continue to work to improve performance in operations, both in the field and at UN headquarters in New York. Peacekeepers must be trained, equipped, enabled, and motivated to succeed."
"We need these three reforms to ensure UN Peacekeeping can succeed in today’s world. And now is the time to make these changes, when the demand for peacekeeping is high and when – thanks to the work of the UN, last year’s summit, and this week’s ministerial – our governments have each renewed their commitment to these missions. The stakes are too high – for those we seek to protect, for our peacekeepers, and for our shared interests – to miss this opportunity for reform."
All of this and more will be discussed tomorrow. So let me just close by reviewing one more lesson we’ve been reminded of again and again over the past few decades: none of our countries can do this on our own.
"With new contributions from each of our nations and much needed reforms, we can responsibly share the growing peacekeeping burden at a time of global change. And we can ensure our peacekeepers can continue to not only prevent local dangers from growing into global crises, but also help provide the citizens of our nations, and others around the world, with the security they need to live their lives, to dream their dreams, to give their children a better future. That is after all, our job. And I’m proud to have colleagues like you here to do mine with."
"ACTING ASSISTANT TO THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE CHARLES SUMMERS: Good morning -- or afternoon, I should say."
"Okay, before we get started, just have a couple things to put out."
"I want to thank you for joining us right before the holiday weekend.  I know, I'm sure you all have plans, but I appreciate you being here."
"Earlier this morning, Acting Secretary Shanahan was at the White House, and he attended the Wounded Warrior Project Soldier Ride.  At 2 o'clock today, the secretary is hosting the Albanian minister of defense here, and you're all welcome to attend the arrival outside."
"Tomorrow, Secretary Shanahan and Secretary Pompeo will host Japanese -- the Japanese foreign minister and the defense minister at the State Department for a Security Consultative Committee two-plus-two meeting.  And I know that there will be remarks and a joint press availability after that meeting at 9:50 (a.m. EDT), which of course you are welcome to attend."
"And with that, I'd be happy to answer any questions."
Bob?
"Q:  Charlie, let me ask you a few questions about the report from North Korea -- by North Korea yesterday, that they had tested a ""tactical guided weapon,"" seems to be the phrase."
"Can you say what that test was or was not?  In other words, can you rule out that it was a ballistic missile?  Or can you say anything about whether it was a cruise missile or any other kind of missile?  Shed any light on what actually happened?"
"MR. SUMMERS:  What -- what I can tell you is, we're aware of the reports that North Korea conducted a missile test yesterday."
Yes?
Q:  It was a missile?
"MR. SUMMERS:  Yes.  I mean, we're aware of those reports."
"Q:  Well, they said it was a weapon.  (inaudible) -- but do you have any information that it was a missile?"
MR. SUMMERS:  All I've seen are the reports.
Q:  Okay.  So no U.S. government information --
MR. SUMMERS:  No.
Q:  -- about what it was?
Q:  Okay.  Do you have any comment on President Putin getting involved in discussions with Kim?  Apparently Kim's going to visit Moscow to discuss the situation.
MR. SUMMERS:  I don't have any comments on that.
"Q:  If the testing of whatever this might have been, a missile or artillery, you -- does the Pentagon consider that a provocative action?"
"MR. SUMMERS:  Again, what I can tell you is we're aware of the reports.  And I -- you know, I can tell you that STRATCOM and NORTHCOM, for the last 24 hours, have been at operations normal."
Q:  Have been at what?
MR. SUMMERS:  Operations normal.
Q:  What does that mean?
MR. SUMMERS:  It means they're going through their normal -- their normal routines.  Nothing has changed.
Q:  Nothing has changed?
Q:  Kurdistan 24.  Two questions regarding Turkey.
"First, could you tell us the status of the S-400?  And have you -- to what extent that has been resolved or not resolved regarding Turkey's purchase of it?"
"MR. SUMMERS:  Well, as we've said many times before, we remain very hopeful that Turkey will abandon its desire to obtain the S-400.  And we are in ongoing discussions and consultations with them to get beyond that issue."
"Q:  But nothing has change with the suspension of the F-35 program, the possibility of sanctions?"
MR. SUMMERS:  I don't have any updates for you on that.
"Q:  And regarding Syria -- the withdrawal of most U.S. forces from Syria, Erdogan's adviser Ibrahim Kalin said today that Turkey expects the U.S. withdrawal to continue, and a safe zone to be established under Turkish control.  Is it your understanding that a safe zone will be established under Turkish control?"
"MR. SUMMERS:  Well, all I can tell you is that our Turkish allies and our SDF partners, you know -- we know that they have legitimate issues that they're discussing.  And those discussions are ongoing."
"Q:  Tony Bertuca, Inside Defense."
Can you tell us what the Pentagon's rationale was for departing from 10 years of policy in not declassifying the size of the nuclear stockpile for F.Y. '18?
"MR. SUMMERS:  I'll have to take that -- I'll take that for you, okay?"
UNKNOWN:  Can you send that to everybody?  That response?
MR. SUMMERS: (inaudible) Lucas?
"Q:  Charlie, can you rule out that North Korea didn't launch or fire anything?"
MR. SUMMERS:  All I can tell you is that we are aware of the reports about North Korea conducting a missile test.
Q:  The North Koreans never mentioned a missile.  I'm just wondering if you knew what it was that they fired off?
MR. SUMMERS:  (inaudible).
Q:  Hi. Yang with Xinhua News.
"On -- the Wall Street Journal reports yesterday saying Admiral Davidson has requested Congress to allocate more resources to Indo-Pacific Command, so I was just wondering, what is the DOD's position on such a request, and if it will take actions upon them to address the admiral's concern?"
"MR. SUMMERS:  Well, I -- as you know, the budget process has not been gone through yet.  And as that works its way through it will address not simply the PACOM, but the entire DOD budget."
"Q:  And also, another question on the (inaudible) meeting between acting Secretary Shanahan and his Chinese counterparts.  Are they currently in any dialogue to meet on any upcoming dates?"
(UNKNOWN):  I don't have an update for you on that.
Jeff?
Admiral Stavridis recently wrote an op-ed for Time Magazine saying that DOD's policy of not having televised briefing is self-defeating.  I just wanted to see if you would like to respond to that.
"MR. SUMMERS:  You know, nothing different than I've said in the past.  I can only address what has occurred since the 1st of January, and, you know, I can tell you that last week, the secretary was before cameras probably four or five different times.  We continue to engage with members of the media, and we'll continue to do so."
Q:  And what is the current status of Michael Flynn?  Is he still in the Army?  Has he been -- is he out?  Do you have any update on that?
"MR. SUMMERS:  I'd have to take that for you, Jeff."
"Q:  Yes, regarding Turkey and the S-400, is -- has DOD weighed in at all? The Erdogan spokesman said on Monday or Tuesday that they were expecting a potential waiver from President Trump to get the S-400.  Does DOD have a position on this?  And has this come up in the conversation between Shanahan and the MOD this week?"
"MR. SUMMERS:  Well, of course, the conversation between the secretary and -- and his Turkish counterpart is not something that I'm prepared to get into.  But I can tell you that we are encouraging the ongoing dialogue to get beyond the issue of the S-400."
"Q:  But specifically on the waiver, do you have anything?"
MR. SUMMERS:  I don't.  I don't.
Jamie?
"Q:  Is the U.S. participating with Japan in the search for this F-35 that crashed?  And are you concerned at all about -- that there might be a safety problem with the plane, or whether -- secondarily, whether the -- some of the technology might fall into the wrong hands?"
"MR. SUMMERS:  Let -- let me take the question for you, Jamie."
Q:  And can we ask that all the taken questions be given to everybody?
"MR. SUMMERS:  Of course, yeah."
Q:  (inaudible) everybody else's taken questions.
MR. SUMMERS:  Absolutely.
Q:  You said the Turkish allies and SDF have legitimate concerns that they are discussing.  Are they discussing with each other?
MR. SUMMERS:  I'm sorry.  I said what?
"Q:  In -- in response to, I believe Lori, you said Turkish allies and SDF partners have legitimate issues that they are discussing.  Are they discussing with you, or are they discussing with each other, or is there a kind of communication with (inaudible)?"
MR. SUMMERS:  I -- the -- yeah.  I wouldn't have anything for you on that because those -- those are ongoing discussions.
Ryan?
"Q:  Sorry, did you have a follow-up, Kasim? "
"Q:  Can we get an update on the situation with additional forces to the border?  Secretary Shanahan kind of hinted last week that something was coming soon, but there seems to have been no movement on that.  What’s the delay -- has there not been an official request from DHS yet?"
MR. SUMMERS:  We don't have an additional request from DHS at this time.
Q:  Do you have an update on -- has the -- or this military seen a change in Iran's posture in the region following the designation of the IRGC?
"MR. SUMMERS:  You know, as far as the department itself, our position, nothing has changed on that.  It's an immigration and nationality act, and there -- you know, therefore, that falls outside of DOD."
"Q:  There's been no threat to U.S. troops in the region, or you've seen no changes?"
"Q:  Yeah, thank you."
"The -- there's reports out this week that the Pentagon is going to cancel or suspend this contract with the group commonly known as the JASON, the scientific expert group.  Any explanation for what the thought process is on that?"
"MR. SUMMERS:  I – at this time, I don't have any updates for you on that.  And as those -- as anything comes out, I'd be happy to share it with you."
"Q:  Yeah, I'm confused when you say about North Korea that you are aware of reports.  So are you saying that -- that DOD has just read news reports, and there's no official statement about what that incident was, or any reporting by the DOD about what they observed?  Did they observe anything, or just that they read news reports about it?  I'm confused about what you mean by reports."
"MR. SUMMERS:  Well, again, we're aware that reports that are coming out regarding North Korea.  And again, I will tell you, as far as STRATCOM and NORTHCOM are concerned, there's been no change in -- in their operation levels at this time."
Q:  You don't have an -- a statement on anything observed on that?
MR. SUMMERS:  I do not.
"Q:  I mean, because I should probably know this, but when they -- after the -- after North Korea would launch a ballistic missile, would STRATCOM and NORTHCOM change their operation levels?"
"MR. SUMMERS:  Again, I -- we don't have any indication of what it was that was launched.  So to respond to your question directly like that would indicate that it was --"
"Q:  I'm trying to -- that -- that's just a different kind of response than I can ever remember getting when there's -- when, like, North Korea would launch a ballistic missile, I don't remember anyone ever saying, ""Oh, NORTHCOM and STRATCOM are now at level -- whatever -- high, or red, or whatever."""
"So I mean, I'm just trying to figure out exactly what that means, that they're at operations normal.  That means they didn't actually detect anything, so they haven't had -- gone -- they haven't changed their operational status.  Is that what that means?"
"MR. SUMMERS:  I think that -- I think it's -- that's fair to say, yeah."
"Q:  They didn't detect a -- any kind of launch, or --"
"MR. SUMMERS:  I can't speak for NORTHCOM and STRATCOM specifically on what they may or may not have detected, but we do know that they're running at normal operations."
Q:  So why can't you speak for them?  You speak for the Defense Department.  They're part of the Defense Department.  (inaudible)
"MR. SUMMERS:  Look, I -- well, Bob, it's the level of the question that she's asking, the specificity of the question."
Q:  It’s the obvious first question:  Did they detect a missile?
MR. SUMMERS:  Right.
"Q:  And so that's why I tried to ask you, and you didn't -- didn't give me an answer.  I wondering whether you're now saying, ""No, they did not detect a missile."""
"MR. SUMMERS:  Well, why don't I take that for you and -- and I'll get a clearer answer for you?"
"Q:  Or detect the firing of anything, even if it wasn't a missile.  Did they test, like, a cruise missile?  (inaudible)"
"MR. SUMMERS:  Yeah, I'll get a clearer answer for you."
"Q:  You just said there was no indication of what was launched, so --"
MR. SUMMERS:  I'm sorry?
Q:  You just said there was no indication of what was launched.  Was something launched?
MR. SUMMERS:  What -- what we can confirm is we're aware of the reports that they -- they have conducted some tests.
"Q:  I guess, whose reports?  Was it news reporting, or is it government reporting, or is it military reporting?"
MR. SUMMERS:  There's a wide range of reports (inaudible).
Barbara?
"Q:  Can I just get back to the border for one second?  At this point now, can you rule out that U.S. military troops will not be used to run any facilities that have migrants?  Can you rule that out; they will not be used to run those facilities?"
"MR. SUMMERS:  What I can tell you is historically, we have not run those -- any facilities like that.  We've had requests from Health and Human Services to identify facilities or land to shelter up to 5,000 unaccompanied individuals, children.  And if requested.  But at this point, there are no requests for housing."
"Q:  So what I'm -- just to be very clear, not asking about identification of facilities, building or construction.  Solely to the question of running them, since, of course, the U.S. military cannot be involved in security activities inside the United States."
"MR. SUMMERS:  The only thing, Barbara,that we would do is -- is provide facilities.  That would not be --"
"Q:  And you can rule out, then -- is your answer yes, that you can rule out that troops will not be used to run facilities?"
MR. SUMMERS:  We would not be running those facilities.
Q:  So you're ruling that out?
My… can we just go back one more time on North Korea?
"Look, on background, officials from many different parts of the Defense Department and the military have said, so far, they see no indication of a launch.  The question is, was there any test of anything?  Or is this just something the North Koreans are claiming with no truth to it?"
Can you -- can you -- you started by suggesting there were reports of a missile.  The North Koreans never even said a missile.  All they've talked about is testing.  So --
"(UNKNOWN):  We've seen the same reporting that you've seen, Barbara."
"Q:  But you must, (inaudible) you know, coming up on -- least closer -- I don't know, 18, 20 hours, wherever we are, the United States has to know.  It would be a very significant intelligence failure, I would presume, if you didn't have at this point a darn good idea of what the North Koreans had done, or if they had done anything."
"So really pressing the point, can we -- you know, what do you guys know about this?"
MR. SUMMERS:  What I can tell you is -- is what I've said.  We are aware of the reports.  And I'll emphasize that STRATCOM and NORTHCOM have been at normal operations for the last 24 hours.
Q:  Suggesting that there was no launch of anything that would fall under their need to respond or be involved this?
MR. SUMMERS:  They've been at normal operations for the last 24 hours.
Q:  Are you still taking the question to try and get us an update on what you --
MR. SUMMERS:  I will absolutely take that that.  Yes.
Q:  You said that you have not been asked any -- you didn't get any requests for housing children in a (inaudible).  Did you identify the military construction that could house the children?
"MR. SUMMERS:  We have a request to identify facilities and/or land.  At this point, I know that those assessments are going on.  But we have not -- at this point, we have no requests for housing."
Q:  So the assessment is still going on?  It's not -- not over?
MR. SUMMERS:  Right.  But we've had -- I want to be clear.  We've had no requests for housing.
"Q:  There was a news report earlier this week that there could be as many as 9,000 to 10,000 troops going to the border.  Can you deny that report or provide any clarity to what you expect at this point would be the number of troops that could deploy?"
"MR. SUMMERS: I can tell you, you know, if we have -- there's no RFA (request for assistance) -- new RFA coming into it.  And there are no plans to deploy anywhere near 9,000 to 10,000 troops."
Q:  (Off mic)
MR. SUMMERS:  I can't get into numbers with you on that.
STAFF:  We've got time for one or two more.
"MR. SUMMERS:  Oh, sure."
Q:  Is the Defense Department concerned by the reach of Russian intelligence as shown by the Mueller report?
MR. SUMMERS:  I don't have anything for you on that.
Anyone else?  If not --
Q:  One last question.
MR. SUMMERS:  Sure.
"Q:  Just to follow up my previous question, is it conceivable that Ibrahim -- to the Pentagon that the statement of Ibrahim Kalin, the adviser to President Erdogan in Turkey, that this -- Turkey would control the safe zone in northeastern Syria, that is being discussed, is that within the realm of possibility that would fall under Turkish control?"
MR. SUMMERS:  I can't comment on what the ongoing discussions are between our Turkish allies and our SDF partners.
Q:  Would you take that question?
"MR. SUMMERS:  Take that question, Tom?  Okay?"
Q:  Can you give a list of what taken questions you have --
(UNKNOWN):  That's got to be about a dozen.
"Q:  Well, I'd like to hear them (inaudible) actually.  And specifically --"
"MR. SUMMERS:  I'm sorry, (inaudible)."
"Q:  I'd like to hear the list, please, of taken questions so that we're all on the same page, particularly when it comes to North Korea."
MR. SUMMERS:  Of course.
"Q:  Would you mind sharing with us what the list of taken questions are, please?"
STAFF:  Sure.  I'll get it to you here in just a moment.
(inaudible)?
"Q:  Can we share with the group, or --"
STAFF:  I'll read it out.  Yes.
MR. SUMMERS:  All right.  Thank you all very much.  I hope you have a great Easter

"And thanks to everyone here at Capital Factory.  This morning, Josh – where’s Josh? There you are – Josh, thanks for being part of the inspiration of this day, appreciate it.  "
"Representatives from this community’s bright constellation of innovative businesses, universities, and government institutions: thank all of you for joining us here today."
"It’s great to be back here in Austin to formally announce that our technology start-up, DIUx, Defense Innovation Unit-Experimental, is expanding yet again and extending the Department of Defense’s outreach to America’s technology community.  Given this city and this region’s deep commitment to innovation, and also, I should say, this state’s deep connections to those who serve, we couldn’t have picked a better place than Austin, Texas."
"I created DIUx last year because one of my core goals as Secretary of Defense has been to build, and in some cases to rebuild, bridges between our national security endeavor at the Pentagon and America’s wonderfully innovative and open technology community.  "
"That’s important, because we’ve had a long history of partnership – working together to develop and advance technologies like the Internet, GPS, and in the years before that, satellite communications and the jet engine.  What we’ve done together has not only benefited both our security and our society, but it’s fair to say the entire world, and that cooperation between industry, the academy, and government helped make our military what it is today: the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  There’s no one stronger, there’s no one more capable, there’s no one more innovative than we.  That’s a fact, and it’s one that every American ought to be proud of."
"But it’s also a fact that our military’s excellence isn’t a birthright.  It’s not guaranteed.  We can’t take it for granted in the 21st century; we have to earn it again and again.  And today, it’s imperative we do so, because we live in a changing and fiercely competitive world."
"Technology itself is an example of that change.  When I began my own career in physics decades ago, most technology of consequence originated in America, and much of that was sponsored by the government, particularly the Department of Defense.  And today, we’re still major sponsors, but much more technology is commercial.  The technology base is global.  And other countries have been trying to catch up with the breakthroughs that for the last several decades made our military more advanced than any other.  "
"Nations like Russia and China are modernizing their militaries to try to close the technology gap.  And meanwhile, technologies once possessed only by the most advanced militaries have gotten into the hands of previously less-capable forces, and even non-state actors.  And at the same time, our own reliance on things like satellites and the Internet can lead to vulnerabilities that our adversaries are eager to exploit."
"So to stay ahead of all these challenges, to stay the best, I’ve been pushing the Pentagon to think outside of our five-sided box – to invest aggressively in innovation of all kinds:  in our technology, in our operations, in our organizations, and in the talent management of our all-volunteer force."
"One way we’re doing that is by pushing the envelope with research and development in new technologies like data science, biotech, cyber defense, electronic warfare, undersea drones – much, much more.  We’re making some serious investments here.  Just to remind you, the latest budget I’ve proposed will invest $72 billion in research and development next year alone.  And that’s more than double what Intel, Apple, and Google spent on R&D last year, combined.  So it’s a big investment."
"Another way we’re investing in innovation is through people, to ensure that we continue to attract and retain the most talented young Americans for our force of the future.  As part of that, we’re building what I call on-ramps and off-ramps for technical talent to flow in both directions.  This will let more of America’s brightest minds contribute to our mission of national defense, even if only for a time or for a project.  It will also allow more of DoD’s and the defense industry’s innovative military and civilian technologists – and I should remind you that there are many of them – to engage in new ways with our country’s larger innovation ecosystem, especially the parts that may have no experience with, or even have hesitations about working with defense."
"Now, innovative technologies and people are necessary, and that’s why we’re building bridges to them.  But technology and people also need innovative practices and organizational structures, so we’re investing in them, too.  The world we live in demands it.  While the Cold War was characterized by the slow and steady accumulation of strength, with the leaders simply having more, bigger, and better weapons, today’s era of technological competition is characterized by the additional variables of speed and agility, such that leading the race now frequently depends on who can innovate faster than anyone else.  And it’s no longer just a matter of the level of the technology we buy.  More than ever, what also matters is how we buy things, how quickly we buy things, who we buy them from, how rapidly and creatively we can adapt and use them in different and innovative ways – all this to stay ahead of future threats and future enemies."
"And to ensure that we keep adopting more innovative practices in the future, I recently created the Defense Innovation Board to advise me and future defense secretaries on how we can keep growing more competitive.  It’s chaired by Google Alphabet’s Eric Schmidt, and the board members we’re recruiting represent a cross-section of America’s most innovative industries, organizations, and people – people like Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, LinkedIn’s Reid Hoffman, Code for America’s Jennifer Pahlka, astrophysicist Neil Degrasse Tyson, and also, as I mentioned earlier, Austin’s very own Bill McRaven.  I’ve charged Bill and the rest of the Defense Innovation Board to keep DoD imbued with a culture of innovation in people and organizations and operations and technology – to support innovators themselves, the people in DoD and the strong companies that already work with us who are willing to try new things, who are willing to fail, fail fast, and to iterate – and to make sure we’re always doing everything we can to stay ahead in this changing and competitive world."
"At the outset, I’ve given them the very specific task of identifying innovative private-sector practices that might be of use to us in the Department of Defense, not unlike our recent Hack the Pentagon pilot program, which you may have heard of, which invited white-hat hackers to help us find vulnerabilities in our networks and report them to us, similar to the bug bounties that several of America’s major companies already conduct.  So while this approach to crowdsourcing cybersecurity is fairly widespread in the private sector, our use of it in the Pentagon was the first in the entire federal government.  And it was so successful we’re expanding it to other parts of DoD.  It’s the perfect example of the kind of recommendations I’m looking for from the Defense Innovation Board – things that are out there that we might be able to use."
"Now, of course, not everything in the private sector is going to make sense for us, because we’re always mindful that the military isn’t a company – it’s the profession of arms.  And so for important reasons, we’re not always going to be able to do everything the same way that others do.  But that doesn’t mean we can’t look ourselves in the mirror.  It doesn’t mean we can’t look around the country for new ideas and lessons we can learn for ways we can operate more effectively.  So the board will recommend a first slate of innovative practices in the fall, in time for me to review and determine which ones make sense for us to adopt.  And I have no doubt that we will."
"Finally, one more way we’re investing in innovation is by developing new partnerships with the private sector across America’s many great innovation hubs, unrivaled in the world – places like Boston, Seattle, Silicon Valley, and of course, here in Austin.  "
"And that’s why we, and DIUx, have come here today."
"Over the last 12 months, since we first opened the doors of the west coast office in Silicon Valley, DIUx has been a signature part of our outreach to the tech community.  And it’s been enormously productive."
"We’ve already iterated – launching DIUx 2.0, as we call it, in May, under the leadership of Raj Shah and his fellow partners.  We’ve expanded to Boston, where I opened the DIUx east coast office in July.  And Raj and his team are already bringing in game-changing technologies that are going to benefit America’s warfighters.  They’ve closed five deals just in the last three months.  It took an average of just over 50 days after they first interacted with a company to award these funds.  That’s fast, especially for the Department of Defense, and appropriately so.  And they have another 22 more projects already in the pipeline for an additional $65 million, in areas like network defense, autonomous seafaring drones, and virtual war-gaming."
"Today, we’re building on that progress with a new DIUx presence here in Austin, to join and complement our east and west coast operations.  "
"Coming here made perfect sense.  The “Silicon Hills” of central Texas have long been a hotbed of scientific and technological innovation – from the garage inventors and dorm room entrepreneurs who follow in Michael Dell’s footsteps, to the startups nurtured in incubators like Capital Factory right here, to the researchers and grad students breaking new ground on campus at U.T."
"But this is also a state with deep connections to the Department of Defense and to our mission of defending our country and our people.  Texas is home to over a dozen military bases, including some of our largest and most populous, like Fort Bliss and Fort Hood.  Texas is also where some of our longstanding and highly innovative defense companies are located – manufacturing key platforms like the Marine Corps’ most modern attack and utility helicopters, the AH-1 Zulu, and the UH-1 Yankee – Venom, so-called – as well as our most advanced stealth fighter, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, and the Army’s High-Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS, which I’ll remind you we’re using more and more in our coalition campaign to deliver ISIL a lasting defeat in Syria and Iraq, which we surely will do.  Texas is also the home of many service members, military families, and veterans.  In fact, Texas has one of the highest numbers of veteran-owned businesses in the country, including dozens of start-ups right here in Austin."
"So bringing DIUx to central Texas and to Austin was a logical step for us.  And we’re fortunate there are two important organizations here – institutions, really – that can help us get established in the area.  One is right here, Capital Factory, where DIUx personnel will start off by working part-time from the co-working spaces here – hopefully benefiting from the close proximity to Austin’s “center of gravity” for innovators.  And the other institution is the University of Texas, which of course has given rise to generations of inventors and innovations in advanced computing, data visualization, robotics, energy, engineering and design, and more."
"One thing that’s unique about our presence in Austin is that it will help expand DIUx’s national reserve element, which is led by Navy Reserve Commander Doug Beck, a decorated combat veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Doug’s a very busy guy, especially right now – in his civilian life, he’s a vice president for Apple, reports directly to Tim Cook – but I’m grateful he could join us here today, and for his continued leadership in the DIUx west coast office.  "
"From there, Doug’s been leading a great team of citizen-soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines, all of whom provide unique value to DIUx since many of these patriots are tech industry leaders and entrepreneurs when they’re not on duty for us – for DoD."
"We’re looking to benefit from such talent even more in Austin, because here, DIUx will build its ranks by recruiting proven local innovators who already serve our country in the National Guard and the Reserves.  Once they come on board, they’ll serve part-time – that is, in their regular Reserve capacity – to help connect the broader DIUx enterprise with local and nearby companies that are developing promising technologies with potential customers across our Department of Defense.  They’ll work in close coordination with the DIUx partners based in Silicon Valley and in Boston.  And if this model continues to succeed, we are going to look to replicate it in other innovation hubs around the country.  The “x” in DIUx is well past proving itself as an experiment, but it won’t stop experimenting."
"Now, to help us get this new DIUx outpost up and running, I’ve hand-picked a leader who was recently one of DoD’s most creative and talented senior civilians – Christine Abizaid.  Christy Abizaid, right over there.  I asked Christy to be our point-person here not only because of her proud legacy of service to our country, but because she has proven to be an innovative thinker and innovative leader everywhere she goes.  In the Pentagon, at the White House, and on battlefields halfway around the world, Christy has always been looking for better, smarter, faster ways to get things done.  Until just recently, Christy was our Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Central Asia – lovely places – serving as one of my most trusted policy advisers for what you’ll all recognize as a critically important region.  And I know she’ll do a great job spearheading DIUx’s presence in Austin."
"And joining Christy will be local Reserve members, starting with First Lieutenant Samantha Snabes, right there.  Before joining DIUx, Samantha’s been serving in uniform as an intelligence officer in the Mississippi Air National Guard.  In civilian life, she’s co-founder and CEO of re:3D, a business she started here in Austin to support affordable, industrial 3-D printing innovations.  Lieutenant Snabes has also worked at NASA and with DARPA – a great example of the innovative people we already have in our military’s ranks.  And I’m sure more Austin-based reservists like her will be joining DIUx soon."
"And before you know, Christy and her team will be reaching out to all of you here.  They’ll want you to help them understand the technologies you’re working on.  They’ll want to help you understand how those technologies can support our men and women in uniform and contribute to defending our country.  You tell us what you’re doing, we’ll tell you how it can help.  They’ll be our ambassadors to you and a way for you to connect back to us.  So I hope you take the time to get to know them, and even better, to work with them."
"This is a very exciting and portentous time.  For those interested in foreign policy and national security, there are lots of interesting challenges and problems to work on with us, and that’s also true for those interested in technology.  But the intersection of those two – what matters and what’s new – is an opportunity-rich environment."
"Let me explain what I mean by that, because there are opportunities for partnership in every challenge we face.  "
"Right now – right now, as we sit here in this room – our men and women in uniform are working with partners from our world-wide coalition in more ways and with more and more power every day to accelerate a lasting defeat of ISIL, which we will surely do and we want to do soon.  They’re training with our NATO allies in Europe to deter Russian aggression.  They’re also sailing the waters of the Asia-Pacific as part of a principled and inclusive network of nations – ensuring that the most consequential region for America’s future remains stable, secure, and prosperous for all nations.  They’re standing guard 24/7 on the Korean Peninsula, countering Iran’s malign influence against our friends and allies in the Middle East, and all the while, they’re helping protect our people here at home and helping to make a better world for our children."
"In each of these missions, you and technologists like you can make a difference, too.  Because whether it’s machine-learning technology that might be able to recognize and block ISIL’s barbaric ideology on social media, or algorithms to help a self-driving boat track submarines, or biotech research that could one day help our troops recover from injury faster, technology’s a critical part of everything we do – and it’s critical to addressing every challenge we face today."
"I want to close by saying that I know many of you in this city take pride in keeping Austin weird.  So let me assure you, I not only want to keep Austin weird; I’m counting on it.  Because the creative thinking that happens in places like Austin is part of what makes our country so innovative and our economy so vibrant and strong.  And I know that with DIUx in town, it’ll also help our military remain the best in the world.  "
"Because when it comes to America’s national security, we can’t afford to be complacent.  Our competitors are trying to out-innovate us, which means we have to be willing to think a little differently.  That’s how we’ve succeeded in the past – thinking differently put us in space, it put us on the moon, it put computers in our pockets and information at our fingertips – and it’s how we’ll succeed and prevail in the future, too: ensuring the safety of our country and our fellow citizens for generations to come.  "
"That’s why DIUx matters.  It has to do with our protection and our security, and creating a world where people can live their lives, dream their dreams, and give their children a better future."
"Contributing to that mission – helping to defend this great country and to make a better world – is one of the noblest things that a business leader, or a technologist, or an entrepreneur, or a young person can do.  And we’re grateful to all of you here for your interest in doing that with us."
"[Senator] Jack [Reed], thank you.  As Jack noted, we came over to the Senate together, 1996, served on the Banking Committee together for 12 years. My first trip to Rhode Island was with Senator Reed.  We held a field hearing in Providence on housing issues, and then he treated me to some of the Italian cuisine in the state.  And I couldn’t have had a better bridge into, or introduction to, the state, the people, the cuisine, the fiber, the character of this state than with Jack Reed."
"
	I think this man embodies exactly what’s best about our country – his selflessness, his courage, and how he comes at problem solving, how he represents people.  You all know he’s a West Point graduate; he himself served in the military for many years after he graduated from West Point.  So Jack, for your continued leadership and support, and I think as was noted here a few minutes ago, he is truly one of the preeminent voices in our country on national security and will continue to be a hugely important voice as we deal with some of these great new challenges ahead."
"
	And some of these I will talk about here in my remarks this afternoon, because, as Tom said and others, this is really about innovation, these three days, and everything you all have done and everything you represent, to build on the past, build on to what has been done already, and it is historic, the accomplishments.  So Jack, thank you."
"
	To my friend Governor Chafee, Linc, thank you.  As Linc noted, we served together, the three of us at the same time in the Senate.  Linc and I sat next to each other on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for many years.  I always admired Linc’s ability to be able to cut through much of the fog, and often ask the questions that no one else would ask, and get to the real essence of a hearing.  I’ve always admired that about Linc Chafee, among other things, so Linc, it’s good to be back with you again.  Thanks for your continued service to our country."
"
	Sheldon Whitehouse and I served together on the Intelligence Committee for a couple years, and not often does a freshman member of the United States Senate get assigned to the Select Committee on Intelligence.  I was probably an accident, an aberration, but Sheldon Whitehouse was not.  And the leadership in the Senate knew exactly what they were doing when they asked Senator Whitehouse to serve on the Intelligence Committee in his first term, and [he] continues to make critically important contributions to our country on that committee.  And good to see you again Sheldon.  Mrs. Whitehouse, nice to see you, and thanks for everything you do and continue to do for our country."
"
	To your two Congressmen – one who serves on the House Armed Services Committee, Congressman Langevin – thank you for what you do, and continue to do.  We are grateful.  I always appreciate your questions.  They are to the point and cogent.  Sometimes they put us in a delicate spot to try to answer them, but that’s your job, and I do very much appreciate your service on the Armed Services Committee.  Congressman Cicilline, thank you for your good work, and what you do.  And I know that [y]our delegation – this delegation representing Rhode Island – is as effective in the business of national security as any delegation in Washington."
"
	To Madam President, thank you for allowing me along with the governor and the speakers to come to your state.  I’ll be out before sundown.  I promise.  And to the other elected officials here, for your service and what you do, and also to our industry leaders – Jack said it, Tom said it, others – the industrial base is critical, and it has always been critical to not just the technological edge and advantage that it gives us, and these men and women that Jack Reed talked about who are in the end what is most important for all of us.  And it is the soldier and the Marine and the airman and the midshipman and the Coast Guardsman that we rely on – those men and women every day who make those sacrifices.  And we’ve got to assure them that they will always have that technological edge, no matter what the challenge."
"
	To the Southeast[ern] New England Defense Industry Alliance, thank you for doing this, for bringing everyone together.  I know many of the people represented here today and will be here the next two days from the Department of Defense are very much looking forward to this.  I know some have been introduced, some of our leaders here today.  Thank you all and please give my regards to all of your teams and the men and women who serve with you and let them know how much we do truly appreciate their service."
"
	This “Defense Innovation Day[s]” really says it all.  And I hope – I suspect, as you all do – it will assure that this will not be the first, nor last, day that you will bring people together.  And it really prioritizes as much as anything else, and share in a value-added way, how we are able to keep that edge in a world – a very evolving and dangerous world. "
"
	Because, as you all know, while we’re grappling with many national security challenges – from the crisis in Ukraine, unprecedented threats and turmoil in the Middle East, uncertainty in Pakistan, change of governments in Afghanistan, to growing tensions in the South China Sea – all we are dealing with today, with this confluence coming together today, we also face a challenge of innovation."
"
	And it’s appropriate that we gather here, especially appropriate on the shores of Narragansett Bay, as an area that’s had a long history of innovation benefiting America’s national security."
"It was on Goat Island – not a thousand feet from this building – where, 145 years ago this month, the Navy established its first station for researching and developing experimental torpedoes."
"
	It was down the road at the budding Naval War College – which I will visit later this afternoon – where Alfred Thayer Mahan conceived, researched, and wrote his seminal work that defined strategic concepts for sea power that are still relevant today."
"
	And it was just across the bay where Rhode Islanders fabricated the Quonset huts that dotted the landscape of U.S. military bases during World War II."
"
	Today, southeastern New England has become the Silicon Valley of undersea warfare.  It’s not only that our submarines are built here.  It’s that their critical underlying technology, capabilities, and future operational concepts are developed here as well.  The close proximity and strong links between academia at the Naval War College, R&D at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, and industry at regional businesses both large and small – suppliers, design teams, engineers, manufacturers – all have created an innovation ecosystem that’s vital to supporting our national defense enterprise."
"
	It’s also a vital part of America’s defense industrial base, which is a critically important national strategic asset – one that I am determined to preserve as Secretary of Defense."
"
	The businesses that comprise our industrial base are as diverse as the troops they support… and like our armed forces, they are unrivaled around the world."
"
	Private-sector expertise helps give our military its technological edge, and helps drive the economic strength that undergirds our national power.  And the private-sector industrial base has always been there when we always needed it, and we needed it most – and we need it today."
"From churning out over 100,000 combat aircraft during the Second World War… to constructing the Mine-Resistant Ambush-Protected vehicles that continue to protect American soldiers and Marines in Afghanistan… our men and women in uniform have been able to count on American innovation, American industry.  We’ve been able to count on them to make the tools we need to win in battle and return home safely.  They can’t do their jobs without them."
"
	As we all know, our defense industrial base just didn’t suddenly appear.  Building it – and sustaining it – took time, and investment, and close partnership between the Defense Department and industry.  It still does, and it always will."
"
	For all these reasons, the health and the vitality of our defense industrial base has been a top concern for all of us at the Department of Defense.  I know it’s a top concern for President Obama.  And that concern only grew as we weathered last year’s damaging effects of sequestration."
"The deep, steep, and abrupt cuts of sequestration took a toll on the force by cutting into the readiness of all our troops.  But we were also mindful of the harmful impact on American industry, and the ripple effects it caused up and down the supply chain.  And while the budget agreement reached last year lessened the impact of these cuts for Fiscal Years 2014 and 2015, we still face the reality that sequestration is the law of the land and will return in 2016 if Congress does not change the law."
"
	This creates uncertainty for DoD, and for industry as well.  No organization, whether a government agency or a for-profit business, can plan for the future without being able to make some basic assumptions about resources."
"
	So we will continue to press Congress to lift this irresponsible cloud of uncertainty, but DoD and industry must prepare to operate in a world of shrinking budgets."
"
	What makes this especially challenging, and what makes our close partnership even more essential, is that resources for defense are declining even as the threats to our national security are becoming more sophisticated, more deadly, and more diverse."
"
	And while we face a multitude of threats and sources of instability in the world, I am greatly concerned that our military’s technological superiority is being challenged in ways we’ve never experience before."
"As the United States emerges from more than 13 years of grinding warfare and large-scale counterinsurgency operations, we’re seeing first-hand that the rest of the world has not stood still."
"
	Disruptive technologies and destructive weapons once solely possessed by only advanced nations, have proliferated widely, and are being sought or acquired by unsophisticated militaries and terrorist groups.  Meanwhile, China and Russia have been trying to close the technology gap by pursuing and funding long-term, comprehensive military modernization programs.  They are also developing anti-ship, anti-air, counter-space, cyber, electronic warfare, and special operations capabilities that appear designed to counter traditional U.S. military advantages – in particular, our ability to project power to any region across the globe by surging aircraft, ships, troops, and supplies."
"
	All this suggests that we are entering an era where American dominance on the seas, in the skies, and in space – not to mention cyberspace – can no longer be taken for granted.  And while the United States currently has a decisive military and technological edge over any potential adversary, our future superiority is not a given."
"
	If we don’t take these challenges seriously, now, our military could arrive in a future combat theater facing an arsenal of advanced, disruptive technologies that thwart our technological advantages, limit our freedom of maneuver, and put American lives at risk."
"
	As Chairman Dempsey and I have said, we will not send our troops into a fair fight.  A world where our military lacks a decisive edge would be less stable, less secure for both the United States and our allies, and the consequences could ultimately be catastrophic."
"
	We must take this challenge seriously, and do everything necessary to sustain and renew our military superiority.  This will not only require active investment by both government and industry – it will require us to once again embrace a spirit of innovation and adaptability across our defense enterprise."
"Innovation was a key emphasis throughout DoD’s 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review, which focused not only on new technologies, but also on developing innovative ways to leverage our current capabilities.  And in the President’s budget for Fiscal Year 2015, DoD prioritized key investments in submarines, cyber, next-generation fighter and bomber aircraft, missile defense, and special operations forces – putting a premium on rapidly deployable, self-sustaining platforms that can defeat more technologically advanced adversaries.  Undersea capabilities that can deploy and strike with relative freedom of movement and decision will continue to be a vital part of the mix."
"
	To realistically sustain these critical investments while keeping our commitments to our people, we had to make tough but necessary choices, and tough but necessary tradeoffs.  These included reducing the overall size of the force, divesting unneeded infrastructure, phasing out aging and less capable weapons platforms, and modestly adjusting military compensation."
"
	While we hope Congress will soon realize these choices must be made – these hard choices must be made – DoD and industry cannot afford to putter into stagnation.  We must do more.  We must do better."
"One of the many reasons I wanted Deputy Secretary Bob Work as a partner in helping lead DoD was his thorough understanding of the operational and technological challenges facing our military.  He also has a deep knowledge of the “offset” strategies developed by national security thinkers in the 1950s and 1970s to ensure our military’s superiority – first the New Look, which prioritized nuclear deterrence, and then the Long-Range Research & [Development] Planning Program, which shaped future investments in leap-ahead capabilities like standoff precision strike, stealth, wide-area surveillance, and networked forces."
"
	As we see those advantages begin to erode, I’ve asked Bob to move forward with an initiative to develop a third, game-changing offset strategy.  As a key part of this endeavor, DoD’s Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, Frank Kendall, will soon convene a new Long-Range Research & Development Planning Program aimed at assuring our technological edge through the next several decades."
"
	Bob and Frank will be the key drivers of DoD’s efforts in all of these areas.  They have my full confidence and my full support, and I will be personally engaged in these efforts.  Given the current budget environment, innovation will be critical.  We must be innovative not only in developing the technologies we buy, but also how we buy them, and how we use them in order to achieve our operational and strategic objectives."
"Although history is our guide, we are mindful that the 21st century provides new challenges.  We cannot assume – as we did in the 1950s and 70s – that the Department of Defense will be the sole source of key breakthrough technologies.  Today, a lot of groundbreaking technological change – in areas such as robotics, advanced computing, miniaturization, and 3D printing – comes from the commercial sector.  DoD must be able to assess which commercial innovations have military potential, rapidly adopt them, adapt them, and then test and refine them, including through war-gaming and demonstrations."
"
	For a third offset strategy to succeed, industry must also have the right opportunities and incentives to develop and operationalize the kind of innovative technologies that our military will need in the future.  That’s why DoD’s next round of improvements to the acquisition system, which I am previewing for the first time today, will be focused on innovation and accelerating the flow of technology to our people."
"
	As you all know – everyone in this audience – attempts at defense acquisition reform have been plentiful over the last half-century.  As the largest steward of taxpayer dollars, DoD must always strive to make every dollar count – and we must do better."
"
	We all agree that DoD needs to be smarter in what we buy and how we buy it.  We all want to reduce schedule slippages, curb cost growth, and get better performance to keep our military edge.  The question is, how do we do that?  Declining budgets won’t allow for repeating past mistakes.  We have to be creative and innovative."
"
	Frank Kendall has helped pioneer a process called Better Buying Power.  It identifies where in acquisition we can have the biggest impact, capitalize on opportunities and fix the problems, measure and evaluate how our initiatives are working, as we continue to refine them and look for more opportunities.  There have been two stages of Better Buying Power.  Given the need to maintain our technological edge under constrained budgets, I’ve asked Frank to develop a third stage, which will be formally released in the coming weeks.  Frank will provide more details when he speaks to you tomorrow. "
"Better Buying Power 3.0 will ensure that our acquisition system helps achieve dominance through technical excellence and innovation – getting the best and most critical technology to our people, at the best cost to the taxpayer, and as quickly as possible.  It will strengthen our efforts to incentivize innovation in both industry and government – recognizing that there are barriers to innovation, but we have the power to remove many of them."
"
	Examples of new initiatives include:"
"
	 "
"
	These initiatives and others will strengthen our defense industrial base and help both the U.S. and our allies and partners maintain our technological edge."
"There will also be new initiatives focused on helping small businesses and start-ups succeed.  These firms are more than just the engine of the American economy – as you all know, many are represented here today – they help drive American discovery, creativity, and innovation.  There’s proof of that here in Rhode Island with companies like Rite Solutions, which developed a groundbreaking Command Decision Support System that gives sub commanders more situational and operational awareness.  About 20 percent of DoD acquisition dollars go to small businesses, a number that has been increasing steadily for the past few years.  When they have new ideas or create new technologies, we want to be helping, not hindering their potential for success.  Small businesses are also an example of niche areas within industry that can be particularly vulnerable when production rates decline.  Given today’s budget environment, we need to maintain the skills, the talents, the knowledge, and expertise that vulnerable firms bring to the table."
"Another important part of Better Buying Power 3.0 will expand DoD’s use of prototyping.  In times of reduced budgets, prototyping furthers technical advances in R&D, it helps keep us ahead of the threat, and reduces risk by lowering lead times in the event we go forward with production.  Importantly, it also allows us to preserve design teams during any long periods between new product development programs.  This will be vital to preserving a robust, capable defense industrial base."
"
	Our acquisition improvements are not restricted to how we buy weapon systems; they also pertain to how we support and care for our people.  Last week, DoD released a request for proposals to restructure and modernize our electronic health records system, so it is capable of meeting present and future national healthcare data standards, and the quality and timely services we must provide to our veterans and service members.  It will allow DoD to do a much better job with sharing information with both the VA and private-sector health care providers.  These issues will continue to be a high priority for me."
"
	DoD will never corner the market on good ideas for improving defense acquisition.  We know that.  That’s why we’ve been reaching out to hear from everyone – industry, trade groups, think tanks, and Congress – and finding ways to work together to make the improvements we need."
"
	As you may know, both the House and Senate Armed Services Committees have been working this year on acquisition reform initiatives; in particular, we very much appreciate the leadership of Congressmen Mac Thornberry and Adam Smith and Senators Carl Levin and John McCain.  I appreciate the bipartisan attention they’re giving – we all are – this effort in particular, as well as their sense of urgency, which I share.  And your two members here from this Rhode Island delegation, who are here with us today, both on the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, are vital to this effort as well.  And I share their belief that we must reduce duplicative, complex, and overly burdensome statutory and regulatory requirements that, while well-intentioned, have made managing an acquisitions program harder, much harder than it needs to be."
"
	Over the past several months, DoD has been working closely with Congressional leadership and Congressional leadership staff in developing a legislative proposal to streamline these requirements to focus more on principle rather than process.  Our goal is to reduce unnecessary paperwork so that acquisitions professionals can spend more time doing their most important job – getting the best equipment and best technology to our troops at the best value to our taxpayer.  We hope to submit our proposal to Congress by the end of this calendar year, and look forward to building on this collaboration as we go forward."
"
	Throughout all these efforts – ensuring a strong industrial base, sustaining our technological edge, and improving defense acquisition – we won’t always get it right, especially early on.  We recognize that.  We could easily allow our time and our energy to be consumed by the crisis of the moment, or the day, or the crisesof the week, which as we know are abundant… but we must also stay focused on laying the groundwork that will define the future.  We can’t focus only on where we are today.  We must also think through where we’re going tomorrow and why."
"
	In order to continue to maintain our technological advantage and stay on the cutting edge of technology, we must be willing to take risks in our innovation and creative thinking."
"We’ve seen that here again in Rhode Island, where in the lean, uncertain interwar years between World War I and World War II, thinkers and strategists at the Naval War College had the foresight to analyze whether aircraft carriers could be used more effectively than battleships.  With more than 300 simulated war games that sought to anticipate future threats, they developed the tactics and operational concepts that would establish naval aviation as an offensive force.  Their innovative work proved decisive throughout World War II, and beyond – enabling countless victories in the Pacific Theater, and shaping the doctrine that put aircraft carriers at the forefront of our military projects, and our ability to project power all over the world."
"
	Today, given the breadth and the magnitude of the challenges we face, DoD and industry – including those in this audience, particularly including those in this audience, and throughout southeastern New England – must once again all work together to harness that innovation, and apply it effectively."
"
	Though our challenges are great, and are many, so is our capacity to meet them: historical opportunities, historical capacity to meet these great challenges.  History shows us that America has always risen to this challenge, no matter how daunting, thanks to the drive and entrepreneurial spirit that is the hallmark of America’s national character.  The stakes are too high, the consequences too dire for us to stand by and let other nations challenge our dominance.  To retain our superiority in the future, our thinking and our actions must be relevant to tomorrow’s challenges.  We will not fail this historic charge."
"
	And I am grateful for the opportunity to share some of these thoughts with you today, and thank you, thank you for what you do for our country."
"
	Thank you very much."
The Department of Defense announced today that it will invite vetted hackers to test the department’s cybersecurity under a unique pilot program.  The “Hack the Pentagon” initiative is the first cyber bug bounty program in the history of the federal government.
"Under the pilot program, the department will use commercial sector crowdsourcing to allow qualified participants to conduct vulnerability identification and analysis on the department’s public webpages.  The bug bounty program is modeled after similar competitions conducted by some of the nation’s biggest companies to improve the security and delivery of networks, products, and digital services. The pilot marks the first in a series of programs designed to test and find vulnerabilities in the department’s applications, websites, and networks."
"Participants in the bug bounty will be required to register and submit to a background check prior to any involvement with the pilot program.  Once vetted, these hackers will participate in a controlled, limited duration program that will allow them to identify vulnerabilities on a predetermined department system.  Other networks, including the department’s critical, mission-facing systems will not be part of the bug bounty pilot program.  Participants in the competition could be eligible for monetary awards and other recognition.  "
This innovative project is a demonstration of Secretary Carter’s continued commitment to drive the Pentagon to identify new ways to improve the department’s security measures as our interests in cyberspace evolve.  
"“I am always challenging our people to think outside the five-sided box that is the Pentagon,” said Secretary of Defense Ash Carter.  “Inviting responsible hackers to test our cybersecurity certainly meets that test.  I am confident this innovative initiative will strengthen our digital defenses and ultimately enhance our national security.”  "
"The “Hack the Pentagon” initiative is being led by the department’s Defense Digital Service (DDS), launched by Secretary Carter last November.  The DDS, an arm of the White House’s dynamic cadre of technology experts at the U.S. Digital Service, includes a small team of engineers and data experts meant to improve the department’s technological agility.   "
"“Bringing in the best talent, technology and processes from the private sector not only helps us deliver comprehensive, more secure solutions to the DoD, but it also helps us better protect our country,” said DDS Director and technology entrepreneur Chris Lynch."
"This initiative is consistent with the administration’s Cyber National Action Plan announced on Feb. 9, which prioritizes near-term actions to improve our cyber defences and codifies a long-term strategy to enhance cybersecurity across the U.S. government."
The pilot program will launch in April and the department will provide more details on requirements for participation and other ground rules in the coming weeks. 
"U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter made an official visit to India at the invitation of Raksha Mantri Shri Manohar Parrikar today, marking the seventh interaction between the two leaders.  Raksha Mantri Parrikar and Secretary Carter reviewed the tremendous progress made in bilateral defense ties and discussed the immense promise for the future of India-U.S. security cooperation.  "
Both sides exchanged views on regional security issues including the threat posed by terrorism. They agreed to continue further strengthening the bilateral counter-terrorism cooperation and underlined the need to ensure that terror groups receive no patronage from any State.
"Citing common values and our shared desire for peace and prosperity in the Asia Pacific and Indian Ocean region, the two leaders reflected on the convergence of interests that have driven the strategic and technological “handshakes” between our nations, and led to historic progress in our bilateral relationship."
"India-U.S. defense relations in recent years have moved along a remarkable upward trajectory.  Marked progress on agreements, including the signing of a defense framework agreement in 2015, have laid a blueprint for collaboration between our defense establishments and enabled deeper cooperation.  Joint exchange opportunities – in both personnel and training exercises – have expanded and strengthened our bilateral cooperation. The recent signing of the logistics exchange memorandum of agreement (LEMOA) has facilitated additional opportunities for practical engagement and exchange."
"Today we finalized India’s designation as a “Major Defense Partner” of the United States.  The designation as a “Major Defense Partner” is a status unique to India and institutionalizes the progress made to facilitate defense trade and technology sharing with India to a level at par with that of the United States’ closest allies and partners, and ensures enduring cooperation into the future."
"Raksha Mantri Parrikar and Secretary Carter applauded the deepened scope of India-U.S. military-to-military ties, which includes a dramatic increase in defense trade. "
"With regard to technology, both sides welcomed the tremendous progress achieved under the Defense Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI) and committed to explore new proposals and other innovative opportunities forco-production and co-development.  The emergence of DTTI as an integral and enduring component of India-U.S. security cooperation is a sign that the relationship has matured to a level of strategic importance.  DTTI will strengthen India’s “Make in India” initiative and both sides committed to convening all new DTTI working groups prior to the next DTTI Group meeting anticipated for February 2017."
Raksha Mantri Parrikar and Secretary Carter agreed that the strong partnership between our countries is lasting and will thrive and grow for decades to come.

"It’s a pleasure to be here with all of you today. I want to thank David for the invitation to speak. Actually, the reason I'm here is because Øystein (Bø) asked me to be here, and when Oystein calls, I answer. "
"I want to express my appreciation for Deputy Minister [of Defense Øystein] Bø for hosting me and my wife in the beautiful country of Norway last fall, and the strong friendship that we have developed. Yet, we think a lot alike and therefore a lot of the themes that you're gonna hear me talk about are going to reflect the very same things Øystein talked to you about today. I also note Secretary [of Defense Ash] Carter's extreme appreciation of the strong working relationship with Defense Minister Søreide and he's also very much appreciative of her leadership in encouraging Europe to step forward in the way of security burden sharing. "
"Now from the United States perspective and as Secretary Carter says at every opportunity that he has, we feel that we are at a strategic inflection point in the strategic landscape. But the next 25 years in the national and international security environment are going to be much, much different than the last 25. And it is going to be incumbent upon all of us to really think hard about how to respond to the changes."
"From our perspective, and from the U.S. perspective, we face five specific challenges. The first is a revisionist and resurgent Russia that is pursuing a path of confrontation, of aggression and coercion. It was just a little while ago in 2012 the United States believed that it was on the path to have a partnership with the Russian Federation, and as a result reduced the last two heavy brigades in Europe. But we felt that we have to talk about this a little bit more. We have to be able to respond to its activities since March 2014, when it illegally annexed Crimea and started to destabilize Eastern Ukraine with nuclear saber-rattling and essential threats against all of its neighbors, most recently against Romania and Poland, for hosting ballistic missile defense sites."
"Second, we're managing a historic change in the Asia Pacific region. China’s development, which we welcome, some of its activities, especially in the South China Sea  and elsewhere, which we do not. There are serious concerns throughout the region and we're working with our partners there to help manage the rise, because it is, we believe, and it is important for all of the nations to benefit from globalization and to raise all of their citizens in an era of prosperity and sharing and trying to approach global defense challenges together."
"We're certainly need a deterrent against North Korea and especially its pursuit against nuclear weapons – intercontinental ballistic missiles particularly. We're worried about Iranian malign influence around the gulf and threats that they pose to our partners and allies in the region, especially Israel.  And finally we're countering terrorism and violent extremism especially trying to accelerate the defeat of Daesh and its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, and everywhere it's metastasizing around the world such as Libya.  All while we worry about protecting our homeland against threats emanating from all five of these challenges. "
"Now just as we are facing a change in strategic landscape, we think that Europe and by extension NATO, is also.  It now faces challenges from 360 degrees. To the east, west, and to the north, NATO faces the challenge of a resurgent and apparently antagonistic Russia. From the south and from within, it has problems with terrorism and violent extremism. And third, it faces a daunting challenge of migration that emanates from those same threats."
"So the future, the next 25 years is going to be different for NATO, and Europe and the United States. The first 50 years of existence, of course NATO was really focused on the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact and deterring them from an invasion of Western Europe, but the end of the Cold War NATO shifted its focus on collective self-defense to out of area operations. But after the attacks of September 11th, when the United States began operations in Afghanistan, we did so hand in hand with Norway and of all of NATO."
"Norway was a very steadfast partner upon which we could depend then, and we know we can depend on now. They've repeatedly demonstrated the need to confront the enemies of freedom wherever they might be. So the United States places enormous importance on Norway's perspective and its ability to serve not only understanding the 360 degree threats which Øystein had talked about this morning, but also its also a 360 degree contributor to the defense of NATO not only in its immediate neighborhood but for expeditionary use as well."
Now in Afghanistan Norwegian soldiers have stood shoulder to shoulder with our own and performed some of the toughest missions there. The warrior spirit of Norwegian troops especially its Special Operations forces is well known and has been demonstrated time and time again throughout the conflict.
"It's also been an extremely reliable partner in our fight against ISIL – Daesh  and thanks to the effort of the broad coalition of which both United States and Norway belong, the relentless nature of our campaign, we argued, very strongly, is starting to bear results and the military momentum on the ground is gaining strength. We still have challenges in the political realm but from a military perspective, make no mistake ISIL is under extraordinary pressure from all directions."
"We applaud Norway’s recent decision to augment its 120 personnel that are already in the fight, with 60 more predominantly Special Operations Forces (SOF) forces that are going to help train Syrian Arab Sunni partners in fighting in Syria doing that in Jordan as Minister Bø said. They're also sending a medical team to northern Iraq. This is going to be especially important as we push towards Mosul and we want to be prepared for unfortunately higher casualties as we do so."
"Now even as we pursue the defeat of ISIL and other violent extremist groups we must also vigorously respond to the challenge on the east – Russia. As Mr. Bø said, they’re modernizing their military capabilities, most problematically for us they're rattling their nuclear saber in ways which we hadn't heard since the Cold War, and it's quite unsettling to hear it. They’re seeking of illegally annex Crimea, destabilize of Ukraine, undermine NATO’s solidarity at every step and we're starting to see confrontation in different ways, such as unsafe and unprofessional maneuvers by Russian aircraft and surface naval vessels. I recently visited Stockholm, Sweden and met with all my Nordic Baltic counterparts and they are as concerned about this reckless behavior as we are. "
"Because we know that all it will take is one minor accident that both sides will immediately say was the cause of the other side, which might lead to a confrontation by accident that neither side wants."
"Now, last week, President Obama, as you all know here, hosted all the Nordic leaders, including Prime Minister Solberg at the U.S.-Nordic Leaders Summit.  And if you haven't read the joint statement, I commend it to you.  I thought it was quite strong.  And it demonstrates the critical solidarity that is required of U.S. allies and partners."
            
"Now, if we do this, as the United States says, one of the things I don't get out of the Pentagon very often.  Generally, I'm in the Pentagon focused on the internal operations because I'm the chief operating officer of the department."
"            But whenever I do, I very much value the personal relationships because it turns out that most of my counterparts, we all kind of think the same.  We see what is happening.  We might have different tactical responses to specific things, but it's quite extraordinary to me the talent in our allies and to develop relationships with them."
"            And so that's why I so much appreciate our personal relationship, because we continue to -- just through ourselves that the leadership and commitment to the alliance and to ourselves."
"            Norway has demonstrated leadership in strengthening conventional deterrence on NATO's eastern and northern flanks.  While the United States and other NATO nations have focused on out of area operations, Norway really never took its eye off of the ball in the High North when it comes to Russian military activities."
            They were constantly watching.  They were constantly providing the United States with great insight on what was happening.  And it was extremely important to us and remains so.  
"            Norway plays an important regional security role, as evidenced by President Obama's hosting Norway and the Nordic countries last week.  And the joint statement which I just referred to highlights Norway's contributions, along with the other countries in the area, especially through NORDEFCO, and Norway's support for NATO's enhanced opportunity framework has been very strong."
"            Norway has also repeatedly emphasized the need to increase NATO's maritime domain awareness in the region, something which we also agree with.  And the information Norway provides to us and to NATO on Russian capabilities is second to none."
"I was able to fly on a Norwegian P-3 on a short mission up in the north.  And I was enormously impressed with the professionalism of the crew, the way they approached the problem.  They told me quite proudly of their capabilities and what they were able to do.  And it was a pleasure being on the plane with them."
"            I also had an opportunity to visit the United States Marine Corps pre-positioning program, which Øystein talked about.  It is an unbelievable facility.  When you walk through it, you're just astounded at the care and attention that Norway places on maintaining that equipment.  It's really quite stunning.  And I want to thank Norway for sustaining this key pillar of our bilateral defense relationship."
"On behalf of the entire department, I'd also like to commend NATO for its willingness to increase its defense budget and especially in investing in critical capabilities, which is so important to both the alliance and to NATO's security.  Norway is one of the few NATO allies that has met the Wales target of spending at least 20 percent of their budget on equipment.  And this is a significant achievement."
"            We’d like Norway to continue its positive trend and reached the two percent goal of GDP, gross domestic product, as soon as it can, but we are especially impressed by its emphasis on high technology capabilities. "
"            Now by doing all of these things -- supporting the counter-ISIL coalition, operations in Afghanistan, investing in defense -- defense capabilities, speaking out and being a leader in the Baltic area of the High North, the Norwegian government demonstrates in important fiscal ways that it understands the importance of maintaining a strong defense and investing in new capabilities to allow NATO to stay ahead of any threat, wherever it may come from and however it might arise."
"And Norway's recent decision to buy 52 F-35s, which I'll talk about in just a second here, the country's largest ever military procurement, is again a sign of leadership in this area."
"Norway also recently hosted a multilateral Cold Response Exercise last March -- 16,000 soldiers, including 4,000 U.S. troops, and Norway plans to host NATO's Threat Juncture in 2018.  And I think you all know that the visuals of U.S. Marine tanks sliding on ice in Norway is one of the most viral -- among the most-watched YouTube clips in the history of the Department of Defense."
"            So I have to say, I just finished watching the Norwegian series  “Occupied”  on Netflix.  The only real problem with that whole series is they didn't ask Øystein to be a star.  And I want to say, contrary to that fictional future, which is portrayed in that story, the United States commitment to Norway will always last.  It is steadfast and that will never change.  The bonds between our two countries are unbreakable.  And that is not something we just say, but we try to demonstrate through our actions.  And we will continue to do so."
"As part of the F.Y. '17 budget submission Øystein talk about the European Reassurance Initiative.  Again, up until 2012, we were reducing force structure in Europe because we will need and want to have a productive partnership with Russia into the future."
"But because of their activities, we felt it very important that we reassure our allies in the north, in the east, in central and in the south, that we would be there in case Russia does other confrontational activities.  And we will now have a heel-to-toe rotational presence of an armored brigade in Europe, which means that by the end of 2017, there will be a full U.S. division, a multi-component division with an airborne brigade, a Stryker brigade, an armored  brigade, and an additional armored brigade set of equipment, in addition to the Marine Corps set in Norway."
            So we're taking these steps just to strengthen deterrence.  We're not trying to be provocative.  We are doing it in response to Russian activities which we can all see.  Now this concept of deterrence that we have -- not really thought about is the NATO alliance for quite some time.  And we need to think about it anew as we deal with the way Russian activities are occurring.
"            We have to start to exercise our strategic muscles as we haven't done.  And I’d like to just point out one of the reasons why we chose to put a rotational armored brigade is because every time that brigade deploys, they will come from their home port."
"            They will put all of their equipment on trains.  They will ship the trains to a seaport.  We will load them on ships.  We will take them across the Atlantic.  We will unload them at a seaport.  And put them together, where they will operate with our European allies."
"            We are exercising muscles that we haven't done since the Cold War, being able to send U.S. forces across the Atlantic in case they are needed to support our NATO allies.  "
"            And Russia is not just getting good at air, land and sea, but they're especially getting good at cyber, electronic warfare, and space, where the United States's reliance on technology, and I would argue NATO's, has been a great strength of ours.  But that strength is being undermined by Russian and other competitors."
"            So all I'll say is there might be some time for questions.  You know, as far as the Third Offset Strategy.  We have long counted -- the United States and NATO have long counted on a technological overmatch against our enemies -- excuse me -- our adversaries, our competitors.  And to overcome the twin tyrannies of initiative on forces that are already close to Europe, and the distance that we would have to travel to help our allies.  "
"            So this has been a key factor of ours, and that's why we call it the Third Offset Strategy.  It is just we're trying to offset these problems that we face in military planning, to assure our allies that we will be there if and when we are needed."
"Now, a number of factors have contributed to this erosion of military capabilities over the last 10 or 15 years.  Budget pressures in all of our countries have led to declining investments, and R&D investments, and force structure."
"            Second, the locus of innovation has shifted right to the commercial industry.  And that is where most of the things that are really militarily relevant in the future are being driven.  And so that means our competitors, whoever they might be, will have access to the same technologies that we have; will be able to use them in ways that we might not anticipate; and it is going to be important that we position ourselves for this competition over time."
            So I want to echo what Øystein said.  This is something where governments and our defense industrial bases and our commercial sectors are going to have to be partners in being able to handle this very dynamic competitive environment.
"            In essence, we have to try to become faster and try to be as fast as the commercial industry.  But I want to tell everyone here, when people say the Department of Defense has to be as fast as commercial industry, they have no conception -- no conception of the size and scale of the Department of Defense, its broad expanse of activities.  But more importantly, what we look for is not necessarily the technology per se.  It is the operational and organizational constructs that use technology to achieve a military advantage."
            And those are not something that the commercial industry has to deal with.  And they take time.  It takes exercises.  It takes training.  It takes changes in doctrine.  It takes exercises with your allies.  All of this is at a pace that is much slower than is mere technology development.
"            So our technological offset strategy focuses on these operational and organizational constructs.  We know that artificial intelligence and autonomy is going to be central to the way we operate.  But it's not just saying, ""Well, let's get autonomy in artificial intelligence as fast as we can.""  It has to be in some type of an organization.  It has to be in some type of operational construct that we work together."
"            So that's the premise of the Third Offset strategy.  Right now, we see artificial intelligence autonomy affecting all of our lives, and the lives of all of our citizens.  That change is happening in our society.  And just like the rifle, telegraph and railroad revolution in war, which was driven primarily by the technological commercial push of railroads and telegraphs that had an impact on the way wars were fought.  It didn't change the character of war, but it certainly had an impact on the way it was fought.  And that's what we're seeing now.  A.I. and autonomy are changing all of our lives, and it will inevitably change the way we fight.  "
"            So what we're looking to do is have what we call joint collaborative human machine battle networks that synchronize operations.  Now, battle networks sounds all science fiction maybe, but it's not.  There's a central grid.  There's command, control, communications, computers and intelligence grid.  And there's an effects grid.  "
"            Think about the British integrated air defense system in World War II.  The – sensor grid were spotters and radar, electronic warfare operatives.  They would say the German bomber streams were coming.  Then there was an underground command and control network with fighter sectors that would say here is where the attack is coming from, and with its marshal our forces, put our forces in front of that attack and try to blunt it.  And then the final effects grid were barrage balloons, radar-controlled antiaircraft guns, stick fires, hurricanes.   "
"            Those three grids operated together as a battle network, and that battle network operates to allow you to achieve a decisive advantage over your adversaries.  And all you're saying is when we inject artificial intelligence autonomy into these battle networks, you are going to have a step function -- step function in performance."
"And that's what we seek.  And Øystein talked about how important it is for us to -- not only our allies, but our defense industrial base and our commercial.  The F-35, that is not an “F” -- the fighter in 35 is absolutely wrong.  It is a battle network 35, a “BN” in 35."
"            And it is built around the idea of human-machine collaboration, where the airplane is a learning machine that learns about its environment and it displays it to the pilot so that the pilot can then make decisions faster and more effectively than the enemies, their adversaries.  "
"One of the reasons why the F-35 took so long is it was so far ahead of its time.  It was a battle network -- a battle network platform that we simply did not have the technology to do.  And it has taken us time to work it out.  But wow, when we have it worked out, and we think we are very close to having the next software drop done, all different things, that airplane is going to be astoundingly capable, astoundingly capable."
"            Øystein talked about the naval strike missiles.  One of the things we need are network to naval cyber-hardened EW hardened autonomous weapons.  The naval strike missile is unbelievably capable.  The A.I., the artificial intelligence that is in that missile, allowing it to fight through very dense electronic warfare attacks, identify its target reliably, and take the attack home -- it's one of the best missiles, in my view, in the world."
And the ideas in that missile are the ideas we need for our future missiles.  I'm proud to say that the Navy is going to have a total of four naval strike missiles on LCS-1 in its next deployment.  And we're testing it.  So all I can say is the ideas that are in that missile are exactly what the third offset is all about.
"            And Norway, we have another thing which we call the human machine combat team.  It's the teaming of men and women and machines to accomplish missions that in the past men and women would have to do.  And all of the research and operational thought into unmanned mind warfare systems that work with human operators is another leading edge of the third offset."
"            So make no mistake about it, we're moving in this direction.  The world's going and we're going to go with it.  We need to be faster.  I know that we're not as fast as we need to be.  We'll never be as fast as people think we should be.  But we are going to work as closely with the defense industrial base and our commercial sectors as we possibly can."
"            Now, I would say that we as an alliance have four key advantages as we start on the road of this third offset.  The first is our people.  We have a premise that young men and women who grow up in an i-world democracy will have an inherent advantage over young men and women who grow up in an i-world authoritarian regime.  We welcome the creative spirit.  We welcome initiative.  We welcome our people doing things when they lose communications. "
            Not so much in an authoritarian regime.  Every single individual is sand in the -- ground in sand in the gears.  That could possibly screw up what the senior leader said that we would be doing.  So we think we have an advantage and we never want to lose that.  
"Second, our advantages of jointness is unbelievably advanced.  We've been working at this since 1986, when every battle networks -- all of the services have to talk together or the battle network is not as good as it needs to be.  We have an inherent advantage here, and I believe Norway has the same advantage in the same that it approaches its joint operations."
            The third thing is combined operations.  Our potential competitors don't really have a lot of allies.  The United States is blessed with a lot of allies.  Each of the allies bring different things to the table.  All of them have different ways that they're going to help the third offset. 
"            And we believe that this is an enormous advantage for us, and one that if we do not exploit, we'd in a big problem.  "
"            And finally, we believe that NATO and the United States have demonstrated time and time again to develop campaign-level system-of-system battle networks.  We do it in our man-hunting.  We do it while we search for missiles.  We do it in our air-to-air.  We do it in our surface warfare. "
"            We put these together.  And we think these four advantages -- our people, our jointness, our combined operations, and our ability to do system on systems -- will help us in this competition as we pursue the third offset."
"            I want to again thank you for inviting me here today.  And I want to thank Øystein for asking me to come.  As I said, I probably would have said no and -- (inaudible) -- said that.  I'm very busy.  I'm not going to be able to come to every single thing.  But as I said, when Øystein calls, I listen.  And it's great to be here and I'm glad I was able to come."
            I look forward to your questions.  
"We have just concluded a very substantive, constructive, forward-looking talk.  I thank Secretary Mattis for generously sharing his deep knowledge and wisdom of defense matters.  I'm confident that his knowledge and experience will contribute to further deepening defense and security cooperation between India and the United States."
I reiterated India's deep interest in enhancing defense manufacturing in India under Prime Minister Modi's make-in-India initiative.  I thank Secretary Mattis for his supportive position in this regard and look forward to working closely with him to realize joint projects.
"As you're aware, India welcomes President Trump's new U.S. strategy for Afghanistan announced last month.  Today, I had useful discussions with Secretary Mattis on how we could strengthen our cooperation bilaterally as well as within -- as well as with the government of Afghanistan, in pursuit of our common objective of a peaceful, democratic, stable and prosperous Afghanistan. "
I am happy to note that Secretary Mattis reaffirmed the U.S. position in support of these principles.  I also welcome his reiteration of the U.S. commitment to work with India in ensuring maritime security in the Indo-Pacific and as first responder to HADR situations. 
I once again thank Secretary Mattis for visiting India.  I also thank him for inviting me to visit the United States to carry forward our discussions.  
"A peaceful and prosperous future in the Indo-Pacific region is based on a strong rules-based international order and a shared commitment to international law, to peaceful resolution of disputes and respect for territorial integrity.  "
"We also appreciate India's efforts, along with those of the United Nations and the broader international community, to increase pressure against North Korea over its dangerous and destabilizing behavior.  In addition to our growing global cooperation, the minister and I reaffirmed our commitment to deepen bilateral defense cooperation, in particular, expanding maritime engagement as one of our top priorities."
"Let me close by reiterating the importance the United States places on building a vibrant defense partnership with India.  This is, again, a historic opportunity for our two democracies, a time of strategic convergence.  As India takes its rightful place at the global table, India will find the United States to be a steadfast friend and partner.  "
"And to Secretary -- to Raksha Mantri, Prime Minister Narenda Modi always highlight eliminating the terrorists and the countries and organizations who support terrorists and safe havens of terrorisms.  Into countries like Pakistan who support, aid and abet terrorism is a cause of concern for the global community.  "
"MATTIS:  Well, on the role of India in counterterrorism, India has suffered grievous losses.  The United States has suffered losses to terrorism.  Many nations around the world have suffered losses to terrorism.  "
"And I believe in the long run that we are going to put terrorism on its back foot, but it's going to be a lot of work and it's going to require a high degree of teamwork by all nations.  And I think that that is -- that's coming into focus.  "
"People of that region and also assets belonging to both the U.S. and India in those two attacks stand out as examples of how such terrorist attacks have hurt democracies both in the U.S. and in India.  And therefore, my request which was received by Secretary Mattis was that if at all and if and when he would visit Pakistan, he would be able to speak out on these issues and take a position."
SEC. MATTIS:  The effort to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula is one that has been diplomatically led and with an increased emphasis here as the DPRK -- as North Korea's provocations have become more pronounced.
"At the same time we maintain the capability to deter North Korea's most dangerous threats, but also to back up our diplomats in a manner that keeps this as long as possible in the diplomatic realm -- this effort in the diplomatic realm.  And that is our goal, to solve this diplomatically.  And I believe that President Trump has been very clear on this issue."
"
MIN. SITHARAMAN:  On your question about, what is India's contribution to Afghanistan, may I remind you that India's contribution to Afghanistan has been for a very long time and it's been consistently on developmental issues?"
"We've built dams, we've built hospitals, we shall continue doing all of them.  Dams, hospitals, schools, any institutions which Afghanistan may require, we shall continue supporting them on that."
"And we're also, at the moment, providing training for -- in the name of good government for their officials, and also for their administrators.  Those trainings will continue so that engagement will also be positively enhanced if necessary."
"So India's contribution has been on these grounds and we shall expand if necessary.  However, of course, we've made it very clear that there shall not be boots from India on the ground."
"Thank you, His Excellency."
I would request media to please remain seated while the ministers move for their next engagements.  Thank you and please join us for refreshments later on.  Thank you.
Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (USD(A&S)) Ellen Lord announced the appointment of Jeff Boleng as Special Assistant for Software Acquisition. 
"Please don’t clap for me; I’m really here to clap for you.  That’s the theme of what I want to say to you, so good morning.  Thanks for being here."
"It was two weeks ago, I spoke of President Obama and his leadership and accomplishments as Commander-in-Chief.  And then last week General Dunford and the leadership honored me with farewells.  But, today I want to say farewell to you and to honor the department I’ve served and loved for 35 years and you that I have served alongside."
"Now, as many you know, I like to the walk the halls of this place, and also the roadsides to the dismay of people at installations around the country and around the world.  I walk cause I like to get a little exercise, I walk to get out of the office, and I walk around to see what’s going on in the department – and, most important, how all of you are doing and to say hello, and let me see you, and let you see me, and give you some sense of how important of what you do is, and how much I appreciate it."
"And over the course of three-and-a-half decades, I’ve seen how this department has changed has gotten better and better in many ways."
"I’ve seen how our missions have transformed – from the single minded and ultimately successful great power competition of the Cold War, which is where I began, to its relative easing in the decade thereafter, to the more than 10 years of skillful but all-absorbing counterinsurgency campaigns that followed, to today’s return to full-spectrum readiness and capabilities."
"And I’ve seen how our technology has evolved – when I started my career defense, and my career in physics for that matter, most technology of consequence originated in America, and much of that was sponsored by government, especially the Department of Defense.  Now, today, we’re still major sponsors, but much more technology is commercial.  The technology base is global.  And other countries have been trying to catch up with the breakthroughs that for the last several decades made our military more advanced than any other.  So we’ve had to make sure we stay ahead, and stay the best.  "
"And I’ve seen how – as the Cold Warriors gave way to those who came after, and then the 9/11 generation was replaced by today’s force – our people have changed as well.  For starters, these halls are filled with a lot less cigarette smoke than was the case when I started.  But more than that, the whole force is higher quality, vastly more experienced, and draws high talent more widely from all of America than was the case back then.  And we’re better and stronger because of it.  And it’s our people after all and above all that makes ours the finest fighting force the world has ever known."
"Now, what hasn’t changed about this institution – and I don’t think will ever change – is why we’re all here.  What brought us here,  each and every one of you, of each and every one of the totality of the force nationwide, worldwide , is doing one of the noblest thing that a person can do with their life: that is defend this magnificent country and make a better world for our children. We get to do that, we have to do that.  But it’s a source of great pride and inspiration, and I think it’s the reason we’re all here."
"I’ve seen that commitment every day when I walked these halls, looking at all the extraordinary people here – uniformed and civilian, political and career, new PMFs and those who’ve served for decades like me – work together with determination to first of all confront the immediate challenges we face right now around the world—immediate, distinct, and evolving but upon us right now.  "
"I’ve seen it in those Americans standing with our allies and countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion in Europe – from soldiers at Grafenwoehr, sailors and Marines on the U.S.S. San Antonio in Estonia, airmen at Aviano, to civilians at NATO headquarters in Brussels.  "
"I’ve seen that dedication in all those Americans managing historic change in the Asia-Pacific and standing strong there too – on the flight deck of the U.S.S. Teddy Roosevelt afloat in the South China Sea, on our bases in Japan and the Republic of Korea, and elsewhere – flying, sailing, and operating wherever international law allows, and strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s continued nuclear and missile provocations. "
"And I’ve seen it in those Americans serving on bases and aboard ships around the Middle East, whether in Kuwait, Bahrain, or other locations, where they’re deterring aggression, countering Iran’s malign influence in the Gulf, and helping defend our friends and our allies.  "
"And I’ve seen it in the eyes of those warriors accelerating the certain and lasting defeat of ISIL – like those in Baghdad who received the first Operation Inherent Resolve campaign medals last April – who are enabling capable local forces to destroy ISIL in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria; and everywhere else it metastasizes: Afghanistan, Libya, and around the world; and also who are helping protect our homeland and our people, which after all, in the end, is what it’s all about.  "
"And I’ve seen that dedication here at home, at the Pentagon and in elsewhere.  In things that people here do: the briefs by strategists, planners, programmers, intelligence analysts, and more who are helping ensure we’re prepared for what will be an uncertain future, as well as a busy present, for challenges we may not even anticipate today.  In the meticulous work of those making sure we have the resources we need – even amid shameful budget uncertainty – to invest in the right training, the right equipment, the right force size, and the right compensation so that our people can always accomplish the mission and stay the best.  And in the care of those at our hospitals, outpatient support clinics, and wounded warrior facilities, those standing by the survivors of sexual assault, and against this offense against honor and trust, and those standing with the families of the fallen – who do all they can to take care of them and all our people.  And I’ve sensed it in all those who are making sure we always live the values that we defend and uphold the laws we’re sworn to protect."
"And I’ve read that dedication by all of you on every trip book and read-ahead I received from our remarkable teams here, every press release from our public affairs department explaining your work to the people we work for.  And I’ve heard it in the proposals and pitches—as they say—of all those thinking outside of our Pentagon’s five-sided box on our behalf– at DARPA, at dozens of DoD labs and research centers across the country, at our DIUx outposts, in the Defense Digital Service, on the Defense Innovation Board, other boards, and more – to ensure we always stay ahead of our competitors and stay on the cutting edge.  "
"And of course, I’ve also felt that commitment in all those across the department and in each of the services who are dedicated to building the Force of the Future for generations to come…so that we continue to attract and retain and develop the most talented people America has to offer, military and civilian, for what is, after all, an all-volunteer force. "
"And I hear that same dedication in the voices of all those who will make up and who will lead that Force of the Future.  In those the cadets and midshipmen I’ve visited with at the academies at West Point, Annapolis, and Colorado Springs, in ROTC programs across the country.  In a phone call with the first women soldiers to graduate from Ranger School.  In conversations at boot camp at Great Lakes, and the Basic School at Quantico.  And the new recruits I administered the oath of enlistment to.  "
"They may be young, but they speak for all of us who’ve been drawn to this department and dedicated our lives to its mission.  Earlier this year, when I was visiting basic training, I went into the bunking area of some brand-new recruits.  Each stood rigidly in front of their bunk at attention.  It wasn’t obvious that they really knew who I was or what the Secretary of Defense was…but they looked terrified just the same."
"And as always, I went up to one of them and I said, “Why did you join us?”  He was 18 years old, with a little stubble of a moustache and kind of alarmed eyes…but without hesitation he said, “My parents always told me America gave us much and I should give back.”  Just like that, and then he started to cry, right there in front of 50 bunkmates.  I’m sure he got a lot of ribbing for that.  But that young person is an example of the kind of kid we get."
"And I’m sure that reason, that calling, that spoke to him speaks to many of you – as it does to me.  It’s what brought me to this place 35 years ago and kept bringing me back.  It is what brings you here every day and keeps you here through the long days and late nights, when you’re far from home or locked in a SCIF, holidays and sometimes weeks on end.  And it’s what drives the 3 million Americans serving, in uniform and as civilians, across this country and around the clock, in every time zone on earth, in every domain –air, ashore, afloat, and even in cyberspace."
"All of them – and all of you – are defending not only the United States and its people; you’re also defending the values and the principles that define us, while you provide the security that will enable our children to live a better life.  Because you do so, and as you work sometimes late into the night, millions of Americans can go home that night to their families tonight in safety.  Because of what you do, our fellow citizens can live their lives and dream their dreams and enjoy the freedoms upon which this country was built, and for which so many generations of Americans have fought.  And because you do so, I’ll walk out of the Pentagon tomorrow, as I have every night of my tenure, confident in the nation’s – and this department’s – future.  And the brightness of that future."
"As all of you know, our mission is demanding and constantly changing.  But I couldn’t be prouder of you, for what you do every day and what you’ve done for us.  And I’m going to continue to be proud in the months and years ahead, as this department continues to live up to the incredibly high expectations Americans have for it and that it’s earned."
"May God bless you, God bless the finest fighting force the world has ever known, and God bless our great country. "
Good evening everyone.
"Thanks  for that kind introduction, John, and for the first-ever Nunn Prize.  This is a particular honor for me because I have such respect for both CSIS and for Sam Nunn – more on him in a moment."
"I’m pleased tonight to get together with so many legends in our foreign policy community, long-time friends of mine, of the Defense Department, and colleagues past and present.  There are just too many of you here –I owe you all too much – to do everyone justice…in particular if we ever want to eat dinner, and I do have something I want to say. "
"I do acknowledge and appreciate Zbig being here, Sam, Carla, Dick Lugar – and more on that in a moment - Michele and so many others…Graham here somewhere?  Thanks each of you for your service to this country, for your support during my time as Secretary of Defense, and for your continued commitment to our servicemembers and their families, which is real. "
"Few people over the past 50 years have made a more lasting and forward-looking contributions to America’s security than Sam Nunn.  As a Senator, Sam was a serious and studious steward of our national defense in the last decades of the Cold War and thereafter.  As Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sam was a leader in strengthening and reforming the Pentagon, both.  And in the years since, he has been a true statesman, helping guide America’s relationship with the world, particularly on nuclear weapons."
"Through it all, Sam has demonstrated that he understands that America’s defense is so vital that we, to whom it is entrusted, must ensure its continuity and excellence across the years, across the domains of armed conflict – not just air and land and sea, but space, and cyberspace –across parties, from presidential administration to presidential administration – and in that connection, I’m committed to helping President-elect Trump and his team hit the ground running, and also across our government, and from strategic era to strategic era. "
"That last one is important and is the theme, I think, of what this recognition of Sam Nunn means.  Sam and I worked closely together – a quarter century ago and with his friend and colleague Dick Lugar– to confront the unique challenges of another transition between strategic eras at the end of the Cold War.  "
"Now, early in that transition, Sam and Dick – almost alone in the country and the world - foresaw a few important developments.  First, the Soviet Union’s was the first-ever disintegration of a nuclear power.  "
"Second, while people had considered accidental nuclear war since the Cuban Missile Crisis, few appreciated that nuclear command-and-control would not, could not be, immune from the disintegration of a society in which such controls were embedded.  And in that new situation, Sam and Dick knew that deterrence alone would not protect us against destruction.  And third, they also appreciated that to prevent that new danger from becoming a threat, the United States would need to work with, and not against, the custodians of the former Soviet arsenal.  "
"And after having spent half a century and billions upon billions of dollars bringing the Soviet Union to its knees, we would need to help them, even fund them, to secure the vast nuclear legacy of the USSR."
"That last idea, as many of us remember, and – as Sam later called it – was a little “wacky.”  It was counter-intuitive, it was innovative, it was controversial at the time.  But it was right.  "
"More importantly, the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program that was based on that idea worked:  it helped the United States denuclearize Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus, safeguard fissile materials, and destroy dangerous nuclear weapons systems."
"It did so because Sam and Dick knew that at a time of strategic transition, we needed to be willing to take bold steps, consider things that seemed to be counterintuitive, some might even think wacky, ideas, and develop new ways of thinking, operating, and investing to continue to keep the nation safe.  "
"That’s an important lesson to remember today, at a time of great change – economic, and political, and military, and social, and technological change – and of greater and fiercer competition even than marked those early post-Cold War years – competition for the lead in technology and human talent, competition for power, and competition of ideas about how the world should be ordered.  "
"In this time of time of strategic transition, and against this competitive background, the Department of Defense is making a corresponding transition from an era dominated by over a decade of skillful but all-absorbing counterinsurgency and counterterrorism campaigns, to one where we must contend with a wider range of strategic problems. "
"Across this range, DoD is confronting today no fewer than five immediate, but distinct, and each evolving challenges.  We’re countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe – something we haven’t had to worry about for the last 25 years, but now we do."
"We’re also managing historic change in the Asia-Pacific – the single most consequential region for America’s future.  We’re strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s continued nuclear and missile provocations.  We’re checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Gulf, and helping defend our friends and allies in the Middle East.  We’re countering terrorism and accelerating the certain and lasting defeat of ISIL.  And, all the while, the Defense Department is also preparing to contend with an uncertain future – ensuring that our military is ready for challenges we may not anticipate today."
And the question I’ll address in this acknowledgment of Sam tonight is the same as it’s been to me for all the time I’ve been Secretary of Defense:  which is how do we successfully confront these challenges  and prepare for that uncertain future?  
"And the answer, fundamentally, is the same as it was 25 years ago:  it has been necessary –it will be necessary – for DoD to change, to adapt, to innovate…not only to meet today’s challenges, but ensure our defense’s continued excellence well into that uncertain future."
"So I want to speak tonight about the changes underway to respond today’s challenges – focusing particularly on the military campaign to accelerate the lasting defeat of ISIL, our Strong and Balanced Strategy on Russia, and our rebalance to the vital and dynamic Asia-Pacific.  And I’ll also describe the actions underway – and innovations we’re making – to ensure that the defense department has the technology, the operational plans, the organization, and the people to continue to defend our country and make a better world for decades to come. "
Let me start with ISIL. We’ve reached a critical milestone in our counter-ISIL campaign.  
"As we meet this evening, American forces are engaged, with our coalition and local partners, in an intense effort to collapse ISIL’s control over Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria, bringing the great weight and our entire range of capabilities to bear in the enabling of capable and motivated local forces.  The seizure of these two cities is necessary to ensure the destruction of ISIL’s parent tumor – the primary objective of our military campaign in Iraq and Syria and to destroy both the fact and the idea that there can be an Islamic state based upon this ideology – put ISIL on an irreversible path to a lasting defeat.  "
"Reaching this milestone is a direct result of deliberate actions taken since 2015.  First, and going back to of summer 2015, I’ve consolidated the efforts for Iraq and Syria under a single, unified command – streamlining our command-and-control for the fight against ISIL, which we had not had.  Then, in October 2015, President Obama approved the first in a series of recommendations that I and our Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joe Dunford made to accelerate the campaign against ISIL – introducing every single tool of our military into this fight."
"And I should tell you by the way, that since then, President Obama has approved every recommendation that the Chairman and I have taken to him for additional forces and capabilities, as we’ve seen and sought to seize opportunities to accelerate the campaign.  "
"We then revised our overall Coalition Military Campaign Plan, setting out three objectives:  "
"First, as I said, to destroy the ISIL cancer’s parent tumor in Iraq and Syria.  Now that’s necessary, but it’s not sufficient. So the second objective is to combat ISIL’s metastases everywhere they emerge around world:  in Afghanistan, in Libya, and elsewhere.  And the third objective is to work with our intelligence, homeland security, and law enforcement partners to help protect our homeland and our people from attack –ultimately DoD’s most important mission.  "
"The strategic approach of our military campaign in Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere is to leverage all the tools at DoD’s disposal to enable capable, motivated local forces to deal a lasting defeat to ISIL.  "
"This strategic approach is necessary because the only way to ensure that once defeated, ISIL stays defeated, is to enable local forces to seize and hold territory rather than attempt to substitute for them.  "
"And consistent with this approach, we’ve employed some of the U.S. military’s most extraordinary capabilities, and some of our most specialized personnel – from air power and special operations forces, to train, advise, assist capabilities on the ground, to intelligence, cyber tools, logistics.  These assets and our personnel have been able not only to help directly enable local forces on the ground; they also bring to bear the full weight of American and coalition military might."
"By combining our capabilities with those of our local partners, we’ve been squeezing ISIL by applying simultaneous pressure from all sides and across all domains, through a series of deliberate actions to continue to build momentum.  For example, when our special operators conduct raids, free hostages, gather intelligence, and capture ISIL leaders, it creates a virtuous cycle of better intelligence, more targets, more raids, more air strikes, and more opportunities we can seize to gain even more momentum. "
"As a result of all of this, for over a year now – play by play, accelerant after accelerant, town after town– the campaign has delivered the results we laid out and planned.  "
"In Iraq, we’ve been helping the Iraqi Security Forces and the Kurdish Peshmerga to systematically dislodge ISIL from city after city – Ramadi, Hit, Rutbah, Fallujah, Makhmur, and Qayyarah, just to name a few.  And our coalition is now doing the same in Mosul – having isolated the city, the Iraqis with our help are on the verge of clearing eastern Mosul, and will then move west to clear the remaining portion of the city, right back at the Tigris.  "
"This is a complex mission that’s going to take some time to accomplish, but ISIL’s defenses are beginning to weaken and I am confident that ISIL’s days in Mosul are numbered."
"In Syria, we and our local partners put an end to ISIL’s expansion and then began to systematically roll it back towards Raqqa, an important objective since it is the so-called capital of the so-called caliphate, and a hub for plotters of external attacks.  After helping capable and motivated local Syrian partners defend Kobani, we and the coalition enabled them and other local forces to take Shaddadi, Tishrin Dam, Manbij, Jarabulus, Dabiq.  And now converging on Raqqa.  "
"As they successfully complete the isolation phase in the weeks ahead, we’re helping them generate the additional local forces that will be necessary to seize and hold that city in the weeks to follow.  "
"In addition to taking back territory, our campaign is yielding results in denying ISIL the finances, the supplies, the freedom of movement, and the command and control it needs to survive.  We’ve systematically targeted ISIL-controlled oil wells, revenue depositories, trucks for smuggling and transporting  – indeed just last month, in one of the largest air strikes of this particular kind to date, we destroyed 168 trucks in one strike one evening."
"We’ve also deliberately focused on severing the territory ISIL controls in Syria from the territory it controls in Iraq.  Leaders of the terrorist group can no longer travel now between Raqqa and Mosul without the risk of either being hunted down by our Expeditionary Targeting Force or struck from the air.  And since we began accelerating our campaign, we’ve killed the majority of ISIL’s original cadre of senior leaders."
"While these results in Iraq and Syria are encouraging, we must stay focused on the continued execution of this plan.  The inevitable collapse of ISIL’s control over Mosul and Raqqa will certainly put ISIL on a path to a lasting defeat.  But there will still be much more to do after that to make sure that, once defeated, ISIL stays defeated.  "
"The fight against ISIL will continue in Iraq and Syria.  In addition, the United States and the coalition will need to continue to counter foreign fighters trying to escape and ISIL’s attempts to relocate or reinvent itself, if they survive alive from Mosul or Raqqa.  "
"And, of course, ISIL’s lasting defeat will require the international community and the United States to stay engaged.  In Iraq, we need to carry on our work to train, equip, and enable Iraqi Security Forces, including the Iraqi Army, police, border guards, counterterrorism forces, and other forces under the control of the Iraqi government to liberate the remainder of Iraq, secure it and hold the areas cleared from ISIL even as we continue to support an inclusive and multi-sectarian, de-centralized Iraq.  "
"And because, beyond security, there will still be towns to rebuild, services to reestablish, and communities to restore, the international community’s stabilization and governance efforts cannot be allowed to lag too far behind the military campaign.  This at my judgement at this point in the campaign is my biggest concern. "
"As I said earlier, success in Iraq and Syria is necessary, but it’s not sufficient for dealing ISIL a lasting defeat.  And that’s why we’re also focused on the other two critical objectives of our campaign, which are combatting ISIL’s metastases around the world, and helping to protect the homeland.  "
"When it comes to combatting the metastases, we’ve taken correspondingly strong actions in support of capable and motivated forces in Libya, Afghanistan and elsewhere.  For example, alongside our Afghan partners, we recently commenced the third offensive against ISIL in Eastern Afghanistan.  In previous two operations, we and our Afghan partners killed ISIL’s top leader in the country and we also significantly degraded its capabilities and its ability to try to take root there."
"Of course, destroying the ISIL cancer’s parent tumor in Iraq and Syria and defeating its metastases must also help us meet our campaign’s third objective, which is to protect the homeland.  "
"On that third objective, DoD is also working, as I said with our intelligence, homeland security, and law enforcement partners both at home and abroad.  For example, we’ve worked with the FBI to systematically eliminate members of an ISIL cell in Iraq and Syria that was inspiring attacks against our country, including against our armed forces.  And we are continuing to prioritize ISIL’s external operations."
The campaign against ISIL and its results are another example of our military’s continued excellence and America’s continued leadership in the Middle East and in the world.  
"No other nation could have brought to bear the combination of resources we have, or assembled the coalition we’ve built, and led the execution of a comprehensive campaign as the United States has done. No other nation could’ve done that.  We did so in pursuit of our nation’s interests – which in this case are aligned with many allies and partners who are also resolved to destroy ISIL; and we did so despite major, simultaneous, and growing military commitments in Europe and Asia, at the same time.  And let me turn to them next."
"That’s a big change for many of us – Sam, me, and many other former Cold Warriors – who worked productively with Russia in the post-Cold War era.  In the 1990s our two nations worked together – through the Nunn-Lugar program, and again on Kosovo, and I remember these and participated in both of them personally – with common, rather than cross, purposes."
"Today, unfortunately, Russia’s aggression and provocation appears to be driven by misguided ambitions and misplaced resentment.  "
"We see that in Russia’s aggression in Ukraine and Georgia, in its counter-productive role in the ongoing tragedy in Syria, its attacks in cyberspace, its hybrid warfare, its violation of arms-control treaties and other international agreements, and its nuclear saber-rattling.  "
"These actions are not what the world expects of a responsible state in the 21st century; rather, each threatens to undermine global security and erode the principled international order that has been so good not only to America, but also to Russia and the rest of the world."
"Let me be clear, the United States does not, should not, seek a cold, let alone a hot war with Russia.  We don’t seek an enemy in Russia.  But we are also defending our allies, the principled international order, and the positive future it affords all of us.  And we’ll counter attempts to undermine our collective security. "
"To do so, the United States is following a Strong and Balanced Strategy.  In it, we’re addressing Russia’s actions and deterring its aggression while pursuing and preserving bilateral cooperation where U.S. and Russian objectives can be aligned.  This strategy does not simply recycle the twentieth-century playbook used to deter Soviet aggression during the Cold War, because that playbook would not meet the Russian challenge or match the Russian challenge of today. "
"We haven’t had to prioritize deterrence on the Transatlantic Community’s eastern flank for over 20 years.  And unfortunately, as I said, now we do.  That’s why the United States is strengthening our military posture and presence in Europe to be more agile and quicker in responding to the threats that Russia might pose."
"Our last defense budget request included significantly more funding for our European Reassurance Initiative, now renamed the European Deterrence Initiative – more than quadruple what we allocated the year before.  "
"That’s intended to allow us – in addition to the two brigades we already have stationed in Europe – to rotate an Armored Brigade Combat Team into Europe on a persistent basis starting later this month.  In fact, over the past few days, the equipment we’re deploying to support that Brigade Combat team has arrived in Germany and is on the rails as we speak.  ERI in 2017 will also enable us to pre-position a brigade’s-worth of equipment and warfighting gear to be used by American forces flown into Europe, these among many other steps."
"We’re also increasing military exercises with allies and partners to demonstrate resolve and build to their resilience, while enhancing inter-operability with them.  "
"We’re updating and refining our contingency and operational plans, including ways to overcome emerging threats such as hybrid warfare and anti-access, area-denial systems.  We’re investing in the technologies most relevant to countering Russia.  And we’re also recapitalizing our nuclear deterrent, because nuclear deterrence is not only the bedrock of our security, but also critical to sustain in light of Russia’s nuclear saber-rattling."
"The United States is not alone in any of this, of course.  For more than 67 years, NATO has been the quintessential example of nations coming together to respond to collective security challenges.  And as it did during the Cold War, NATO will be critical to preserving collective defense in the face of new and renewed threats."
"To ensure it does so, NATO, too, is adapting to use a new playbook – one that prepares to counter cyber threats and hybrid warfare, to better integrate our conventional and nuclear deterrence, and much, much more.  "
"That’s why NATO created a Very-High-Readiness Joint Task Force that can deploy allied forces on 48 [hours’] notices to any crisis on allied territory.  That’s why NATO is also deploying four battalions to its eastern flank – one each in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland – the latter by the way is where the United States will lead a battalion starting in April this year.  And it’s why NATO is providing support to partner countries like Ukraine and Georgia to help strengthen and reform their national defense institutions and to improve their ability to work with NATO."
"But it’s also necessary to keep the door open to working with Russia, when and where our interests align, or can be made to align.  And as I said, there was a time, in the years after the Cold War, when Russia cooperated with the United States and other nations, contributing to the principled international order rather than undermining it.  I remember that personally – and so do many of you.  And perhaps someday, we’ll see that spirit rekindled."
"Next, I want to discuss what the defense department has to do to carry out the security aspect of President Obama’s rebalance to the Asia-Pacific.  The rebalance has ensured that DoD will continue to help provide the security necessary for that consequential region – home to nearly half the global population and nearly half the global economy – and allow it to remain a place where everyone can rise and prosper."
"That’s been American policy and practice since the end of World War II.  Regardless of what else was going on at home or in other parts of the world – during Democratic and Republican administrations, in times of surplus and deficit, war and peace else – the United States has remained economically, politically, and militarily engaged in the Asia-Pacific."
"Now, unlike elsewhere in the world, peace and stability there has never been managed by a region-wide, formal structure like NATO in Europe.  That’s made sense because of the Asia-Pacific’s unique history, geography, and politics.  "
"Instead, the United States has long taken a principled and inclusive approach, and collaborated with a network of regional allies and partners to enable security and uphold important principles like resolving disputes peacefully; ensuring countries can make choices free from external coercion and intimidation; and preserving the freedom of overflight and navigation guaranteed by international law. "
"Because we did so, out of the rubble of World War II, economic miracle after miracle occurred.  Think about it…first Japan, then Taiwan, South Korea, and Southeast Asia, and now, today, China, India, and others rose and prospered.  "
"That progress has produced incredible changes in the region:  populations are growing, education has improved, freedom and self-determination have spread, economies have grown more interconnected, and military spending and cooperation are both increasing. "
"Amid all this remarkable change and progress, America’s interests and objectives in the Asia-Pacific have endured:  we still want peace, stability, and progress there for all, including ourselves.  But as the region has changed, our approach to how we advance our interests and uphold those enduring principles has had to change along with it.  "
"In the rebalance’s first phase, DoD sent tens of thousands of additional American personnel to the region, committed to homeporting 60 percent of our naval and overseas air assets to the Asia-Pacific, and began to modernize our regional posture around Guam as a strategic hub."
"In the second phase, which we launched almost two years ago, we committed to sending some of our best people and our most advanced capabilities to the region – our newest submarines, aircraft, and surface warfare vessels, for example – even as we developed new and innovative strategies and operational concepts for the principal contingencies that could occur there. "
"We also significantly strengthened our bilateral alliances and partnerships.  Nurtured over decades, tested in crisis, and built on shared interests, values, and sacrifice, we’ve now strengthened these relationships so they better reflect 21st century security needs.  There are many examples to point to in the region – whether it’s our long-time alliances with Japan, the Republic of Korea and Australia, or our newer growing partnerships with India, Singapore, Vietnam and others."
"Now, in the third phase, it will be necessary to cement the progress we’ve made in the first and second, and more importantly, build upon it. "
"It will be necessary for the United States to continue to sharpen our military edge so we remain the most powerful military in the region, and the security partner of choice, by increasing and targeting investments in capabilities suited to the region to ensure we stay the best there.  "
"We’ll also continue to make “leap-ahead” technological investments – including some surprising ones – that will help us keep the lead in the Asia-Pacific, and elsewhere. "
"And we’ll further catalyze the Asia-Pacific’s growing Principled and Inclusive Security Network.  Although it’s not a formal alliance like NATO, this burgeoning network – built on trilateral and multilateral as well as bilateral relationships – is grounded in those principles I mentioned earlier.  It’s inclusive, since any nation and any military   can contribute – that’s the American approach. "
"That’s all to the good for the region and the United States, but it’s important to remember, the rebalance and this Asia-Pacific security network are not aimed at any particular country.  The network’s not closed and excludes no one.  Although we have disagreements with China, including over its destabilizing behavior in the South China Sea – and its behavior is in fact driving many more to work more closely with us – we’re committed to working with China where possible, to introducing measures to reduce risk, and to encouraging China to avoid self-isolation."
"All this is happening today.  But even as we confront the challenges of this time of strategic transition, it will also be necessary for DoD to lead and compete well into the future.  "
"Today ours is the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  There’s no military that’s stronger, more capable, more experienced, or more innovative.  But that’s not a birthright, it’s not guaranteed.  We can’t take it for granted.  We need to earn it again and again."
"To do so, we have to invest and innovate for the uncertain future we face, as well as deal with the problems of today.  And that’s why I’ve been consistently pushing the Pentagon to think, as I put it, outside of our five-sided-box to ensure that our technology, our plans, our organization, and above all, our people stay the best for decades to come."
"We’ve made the decisions and investments to ensure DoD maintains our dominance in every domain, not just sea and air and land, but also in space, and cyberspace.  "
"We’re pushing the envelope with research and development despite the budget woes to stay ahead of our competitors and at technology’s frontier, by putting for example nearly $72 billion dollars into R&D alone this next year.  To give you a little context, that’s more than double what Apple, Intel, and Google spent on R&D combined in 2015."
"Beyond that, we’ve been building and rebuilding bridges between the Pentagon and America’s technology community.  "
"One way we’re doing that is through our Defense Innovation Unit-Experimental, or DIUx – which I created to help connect with startups and other commercial tech firms in Silicon Valley, Boston, Austin, and everywhere in between.  Those outposts are already producing results:  DIUx has interacted with companies in over 30 states to help us adopt technologies more quickly that can help our warfighters accomplish their missions.  We always will continue to need our excellent existing and traditional defense partners that help us build our amazing defense systems, but DIUx will also help better connect the Pentagon as a whole to the entire world of American innovation.  That’s an investment worth making.  Because when I started my life in science and technology and national security most technology of consequence came from the United States, and most of that from government sponsorship.   We’re still an influential force, but it’s not just us in the Defense Department anymore.  To stay the best, we need to interact with the rest of the technological ecosystem."
"We’re also innovating operationally in our operations plans.  Our core contingency plans are constantly being changed to apply innovation to our operational approaches – including ways to overcome emerging threats, such as anti-satellite weapons or hybrid warfare.  We’re building in modularity, planning in new ways for overlapping contingencies, and injecting agility and flexibility into our war plans."
"Meanwhile we’re making reforms across the DoD enterprise – streamlining our headquarters operations, lowering our health care costs, continuing to improve our acquisition process, and more.  We’re also continuing to support and seek improvements in the spirit of Goldwater-Nichols – which Sam Nunn had so much to do with – among other changes, to clarify the role and authority of the Chairman, and the Joint Chiefs, and the Joint Staff, and to help our Combatant Commanders be more efficient and agile and support me and the President, especially in the face of transregional and transfunctional challenges.  "
"And we’re ensuring DoD’s a place where thinking boldly and differently is fostered.  One way we’re doing so is with the Defense Innovation Board I established last year, chaired by Google-Alphabet’s Eric Schmidt.  Its members are already making a mark.  For example, on their recommendation, we have now a Chief Innovation Officer, which many companies have by the way, to act as a senior advisor to the Secretary of Defense.  "
"And lastly, and importantly Sam alluded to this, we’re building what I call the Force of the Future…to ensure that amid generational, technological, and labor market changes, we continue to attract and retain and develop the most talented people America has to offer, for what is after all an all-volunteer force.  "
"In total, the Force of the Future initiatives span the career of a uniformed servicemember or DoD civilian – from recruiting men and women to join, to caring for, retaining, and developing them, and then to helping successfully transition those who want to move on.  "
"And these initiatives include reinvigorating and expanding the geographic reach of our Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program, which by the way just had its 100th birthday this year; making common-sense improvements to military talent management and officer promotion; giving components the authority to directly hire civilians on college campuses – this is a big deal if you remember your mind-set in college; recognizing survey data indicating the importance of family life to retention –  bearing in mind that our force is largely a married force – by expanding maternity and paternity leave and extending on-base childcare hours, and other steps of this kind."
"And also, ensuring that DoD must be able to draw from 100 percent of the American population…and to compete for the best we must select the best based solely upon their qualifications to meet our high standards – not race, not gender, identity, sexual orientation – but rather, focusing on whether someone can meet our standards as the best person for the job."
"In conclusion, because we’re doing all this, because DoD’s changing, and adapting, and innovating, because of our nation’s enduring strengths, I’m confident that its future is bright and that there are many opportunities for our country to seize. "
"But I can never forget – and we can never forget – and I’m even more mindful as my days as Secretary of Defense grows short, about who makes it all happen: it’s DoD’s people.  "
"Each of our servicemembers and DoD civilians makes me proud, incredibly proud.  There are almost 3 million of them serving across this country and around the clock, in every time zone on earth, in every domain – in the air, ashore, afloat, and even in cyberspace – all in service of this great nation."
"All of them are defending not only the United States and its people; they’re also defending the values and the principles that define us, while they provide the security that will enable our children to live a better life. "
"Because they do so, we can gather here this evening in safety and celebrate Sam Nunn.  We can go to work tomorrow or study at one of America’s world-class universities.  We can live our lives and dream our dreams and enjoy the freedoms upon which this country was built, and for which so many generations of Americans have fought. "
"They make all that possible.  And at a time when not as many serve, I want them all to know– I ask you to take a moment to reflect yourselves – that we don’t take them for granted.  Stephanie, my wife, and I begin every day with them. "
"As all of you know, our mission is demanding and constantly changing.  But I couldn’t be prouder of them for what they do every day and what they’ve done for us.  Their excellence is unparalleled.  Their service is invaluable.  And their sacrifices will never be forgotten.  So, on that note let me just say, may God bless them, God bless our great country.  "
"Sam, I’m honored to be here this evening. Thank you for this honor.  Let’s enjoy this evening."
"Thanks, David.  Appreciate it.  And good morning, everyone.  Appreciate you being here.  It's a pleasure for me to be -- what I understand, David, to be the first secretary of defense to address the Economic Club of Washington."
"And one of the core tasks for me, and one of my core goals in this job has been to build and to rebuild bridges between our wonderful department, and the wonderful, innovative, strong American technology and industry community."
"So, I appreciate you returning the favor by giving me the opportunity to be here as, what is, of course, the largest institution with the largest budget in America."
"And it's that budget I'd like to discuss with you this morning.  A week from now, President Obama will release his administration's budget for fiscal year 2017.  About half of its discretionary portion -- that is, $582.7 billion, to be precise -- will be allocated for the Department of Defense."
"And today, I would like to preview with you some of the overarching themes, and some of the new investments that we will be making -- because the fact is, this budget marks a major inflection point for the Department of Defense."
"In this budget, we're taking the long view.  We have to, because even as we fight today's fights, we must also be prepared for the fights that might come, 10, 20 or 30 years down the road."
"Last fall's budget deal set the size of our budget, allowing us to focus on the shape, making choices and trade-offs to adjust to a new, strategic era, and to seize opportunities for the future."
"Let me describe the strategic thinking that drove our budget decisions.  First of all, it's evident that America is still, today, the world's foremost leader, partner and underwriter of stability and security in every region across the globe -- as we have been since the end of World War II."
"And as we fulfill this enduring role, it's also evident that we're entering a new strategic era.  Context is important here.  A few years ago, following over a decade when we were focused, of necessity, on large scale counter insurgency operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, DOD began embarking on a major strategy shift to sustain our lead in full spectrum war fighting."
"While the basic elements of our resulting defense strategy remain valid, it has also been abundantly clear to me over the last year that the world has not stood still since then – the emergence of ISIL and the resurgence of Russia being just a couple of the examples."
"This is reflective of a broader strategic transition underway, not unlike those we've seen in history following the end of other major wars."
Today's security environment is dramatically different than the one we've been engaged in for the last 25 years and it requires new ways of thinking and new ways of acting.
"I've talked with President Obama about this a great deal over the last year and as a result, we have five, in our minds, evolving challenges that have driven the focus of the Defense Department's planning and budgeting this year."
"Two of these challenges reflect a return to great power of competition.  First is in Europe, where we're taking a strong and balanced approach to deter Russian aggression, and we haven't had to worry about this for 25 years; while I wish it were otherwise, now we do.  Second is in the Asia-Pacific, where China is rising and where we're continuing and will continue our rebalance, so-called, to maintain the stability in the region that we have underwritten for 70 years and that's allowed so many nations to rise and prosper and win.  That's been our presence."
"Third challenge is North Korea – a hardy perennial – a threat to both us and to our allies, and that's why our forces on the Korean Peninsula remain ready every single day, today, tomorrow, to, as we call it, fight tonight."
"Iran is the fourth challenge, because while the nuclear deal was a good deal and doesn't limit us in the Defense Department in any way – none of its provisions affect us or limit us – we still have to counter Iran's malign influence against our friends and allies in the region, especially Israel."
"And challenge number five is our ongoing fight to defeat terrorism and especially ISIL, most immediately in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, and also, where it is metastasizing in Afghanistan, Africa and elsewhere.  All the time, we protect -- all the while, we're protecting our homeland and our people."
"While ISIL must and will be defeated now, in the longer perspective we must also take into account in our budget that as destructive power of greater and greater magnitude falls into the hands of smaller and smaller and more aberrant groups of people, countering terrorists will likely be a continuing part of the future responsibilities of defense and national security leaders far into the future as I can see."
"DOD must and will address all five of those challenges as part of its mission to defend our people and defend our country.  Doing so requires some new thinking on our part, new posture in some regions and also new and enhanced capabilities.  For example, as we confront these five challenges, we'll now have to deal with them across all domains, not just the usual air, land and sea, but also particularly in the areas of cyber, space and electronic warfare, where our reliance on technology has given us great strengths, but also lead to vulnerabilities that adversaries are eager to exploit."
"Here, our approach is being able to deter our most advanced competitors.  We must have – and be seen to have – the ability to impose unacceptable costs on an advanced aggressor that will either dissuade them from taking provocative action or make them deeply regret it if they do."
"To be clear, the U.S. military will fight very differently in coming years than we have in Iraq and Afghanistan or in the rest of the world's recent memory."
"We will be prepared for a high-end enemy.  That's what we call full spectrum.  In our budget, our plans, our capabilities and our actions, we must demonstrate to potential foes, that if they start a war, we have the capability to win.  Because a force that can deter conflict must show that it can dominate a conflict."
" In this context, Russia and China are our most stressing competitors.  They have developed and are continuing to advance military systems that seek to threaten our advantages in specific areas.  And in some case, they are developing weapons and ways of wars that seek to achieve their objectives rapidly, before they hope, we can respond."
"Because of this and because of their actions to date, from Ukraine to the South China Sea, DOD has elevated their importance in our defense planning and budgeting.  While we do not desire conflict of any kind with either of these nations -- and let me be clear, though they pose similar defense challenges, they're otherwise very different nations and situations – we also cannot blind ourselves to the actions they appear to choose to pursue. "
Let me now highlight some new investments we're making in this budget to address both the near-term challenges – I'll start with the near-term challenges and begin there with our campaign to deliver a lasting defeat to ISIL.
"As I said a couple of weeks ago at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, and in Paris a week and a half ago, and as I'll reiterate when I meet with my coalition counterparts in Brussels next week, we must and we will defeat ISIL."
"Because we are accelerating the campaign, DOD is backing that up and we need to back it up in our budget with a total of $7.5 billion in 2017, 50 percent more than in 2016.  This will be critical as our updated coalition military campaign plan kicks in."
"For example, we've recently been hitting ISIL with so many GPS-guided smart bombs and laser-guided rockets that we’re starting to run low on the ones that we use against terrorists the most.  So we're investing $1.8 billion in F.Y. '17, to buy over 45,000 more of them."
"We're also investing to maintain more of our 4th generation fighter and attack jets that we previously planned, including the 810, which has been devastating to ISIL from the air. The budget defers the A-10's final retirement until 2022, replacing it with F-35 Joint Strike Fighters on a squadron-by-squadron basis, so we'll always have enough aircraft for today's conflicts."
"Another near-term investment in the budget is how we are reinforcing our posture in Europe to support our NATO allies in the face of Russia's aggression – in Pentagon parlance, this is called the European Reassurance Initiative – and after requesting about $800 million for last year, this year we're more than quadrupling it for a total of $3.4 billion in 2017."
"That will fund a lot of things: more rotational U.S. forces in Europe, more training and exercising with our allies, more preposition and war-fighting gear and infrastructure improvements to support all this. And when combined with U.S. forces already in and assigned to Europe -- though also substantial -- all of this together by the end of 2017 will let us rapidly form a highly-capable combined arms ground force that can respond across that theater, if necessary."
"And as you can imagine, the budget also makes important investments in new technologies.  We have to do this to stay ahead of future threats in a changing world.  As other nations try to catch on the advantages that we have enjoyed for decades, in areas like precision-guided munitions, stealth, cyber and space."
"Some of these investments are long-term, and I will get to them in a moment.  But to help maintain our advantages now, DOD has an office that we don't often talk about, but I want to highlight today.  It's called the Strategic Capabilities Office, or SCO for short."
"I created the SCO in 2012 when I was deputy secretary of defense to help us to re-imagine existing DOD and intelligence community and commercial systems by giving them new roles and game-changing capabilities to confound potential enemies -- the emphasis here was on rapidity of fielding, not 10 and 15-year programs.  Getting stuff in the field quickly."
We need to make long-term investments as well.  I will get to them in a moment.  But the focus here was to keep up with the pace of the world.
"I picked a talented physicist -- also, by the way, a Rhodes Scholar.  SCO is incredibly innovative, but it also has the rare virtue of rapid development, and an rarer virtue of keeping current capabilities viable for as long as possible -- in other words, it tries to build on what we have.  Smart.  So, it's good for the troops, it's good for the taxpayers, too. "
"Thinking differently in this way – as is well known in U.S. defense history – put us in space, our country on the moon, computers in the pockets, information at the fingertips -- all of that.  Taking airplanes off of the decks of ships, nuclear submarines beneath the seas, satellite networks that take pictures of the world -- all of those things."
"This kind of bold and innovative thinking can't be lost to history, it's happening now everyday, not only in SCO but in other places throughout the Department of Defense, like our dozens of laboratories and engineering centers, located all over the country."
"As we drive this work for the budget, grows our research and development accounts for the second year in a row, investing a total of $71.4 billion in R&D in 2017 -- a number that no other institution in the United States or the world comes close to."
"And to show the return we're getting on those investments, I'll tell you about a few projects in the SCO that it has been working on, and that are funded in this budget.  Some of them you may have heard of, but my guess is some of them you have not -- and I know that some of them, we're talking about for the very first time here."
"First is a project focused on advanced navigation.  What the SCO's doing is taking the same kinds of micro-cameras, sensors, MEMS [microelectromechanical systems], and so forth that are littered throughout our smartphones and everything today, and putting them on our small diameter bombs to augment the existing target capabilities on the SDB.  This will eventually be a modular kit that will work with many other payloads, enabling off network targeting through commercial components, small enough to hold in your hand like your phone, and cheap enough to own like your phone."
"Another project uses swarming autonomous vehicles in all sorts of ways and in multiple domains.  In the air, they develop micro-drones that are really fast, really resistant.  They can fly through heavy winds and be kicked out the back of a fighter jet moving at Mach 0.9, like they did during an operational exercise in Alaska last year, or they can be thrown into the air by a soldier in the middle of the Iraqi desert.  And for the water, they've developed self-driving boats which can network together to do all kinds of missions, from fleet defense to close-in surveillance, without putting sailors at risk.  Each one of these leverages the wider world of technology.  For example, the microdrones, I mentioned a moment ago, use a lot of commercial components and are actually 3-D printed and the boats build on some of the same artificial intelligence algorithms that long-ago and in a much more primitive form were on the Mars lander."
"They've also got a project on gun-based missile defense, where we're taking some of the same hypervelocity smart projectiles that we developed for the electromagnetic gun.  That's the railgun.  And using it for point defense.  By firing it with artillery, we already have in our inventory, including the five-inch guns on the front of every Navy destroyer and also the hundreds of Army Paladin self-propelled howitzers.  In this way, instead of spending more money on more expensive interceptors or on new platforms, we can turn past offense into future defense – defeating incoming missile raids at a much lower cost per round and thereby imposing higher costs on an attacker.  In fact, we tested the first shots of the hypervelocity projectile out of a Paladin a little over a month ago, and we also found that it significantly increases the Paladin's range."
"And the last project I want to highlight is one that we're calling the arsenal plane, which takes one of our oldest aircraft platform and turns it into a flying launchpad for all sorts of different conventional payloads. In practice, the arsenal plane will function as a very large airborne magazine, network to fifth generation aircraft that act as forward sensor and targeting nodes, essentially combining different systems already in our inventory to create holy new capabilities."
So these are just a few examples of what the SCO has done so far and they're working a lot more.
"Now, there are many other areas where we're driving smart and essential technological innovation in the budget to stay ahead of future threats over the long-term and keep our military in the decades ahead the best in the world, the first with the most, bar none."
"One of these is undersea capabilities, where we continue to dominate and where the budget invests over $8.1 billion in 2017 and more than $40 billion over the next five years to give us the most lethal undersea and any submarine force in the world.  It buys more advanced maritime control aircraft.  And it not only buys nine of our most advanced Virginia-class attack submarines over the next five years; it also equips –more of them with the versatile Virginia Payload Module, which triples each submarine platform’s strike capacity from 12 Tomahawk missiles to 40."
"Now, budgets often require trade-offs, which all of you in your own domains are very familiar with.  So where trade-offs among force structure, modernization and readiness posture needed to be made we generally pushed to favor the latter two.  This is important, because our military has to have the agility and ability to win not only the wars that could happen today, but also the wars that could happen in the future."
"To put more money in submarines, Navy fighter jets, and a lot of other important areas, one trade-off we made was to buy only as many Littoral Combat Ships as we really need.  This is part of a broader effort in our budget to focus the Navy on having greater lethality and capability that can turn deter and defeat even the most high-end future threats.  I'll be discussing this further tomorrow in San Diego when I visit some of our Navy surface warfare sailors. "
"We're also investing more in cyber, totaling nearly $7 billion in 2017, and almost $35 billion over the next five years.  Among other things, this will help to further DOD's network defenses, which is critical; build more training ranges for our cyber warriors; and also develop cyber tools and infrastructure needed to provide offensive cyber options."
"I also want to mention space because at times in the past, space was seen as a sanctuary, new and emerging threats make clear that that's not the case anymore and we must be prepared for the possibility of a conflict that extends in space.  Last year we added over $5 billion in new investments to make us better postured for that.  And then in 2017 we’re doing even more, enhancing our ability to identify, attribute and negate all threatening actions in space.  For so many commercial space endeavors, we want this domain to be just like the oceans and the Internet: free and safe for all."
There are some in this world who don't want that to happen – who see America's dominance in these and other areas and want to take that away from us in the future so that we can't operate effectively around the globe.  So we’re not waiting to invest until the threats are fully realized.  We're investing now so we stay ahead of them. 
"And of course, pioneering and dominating technological frontiers is just one way that our budget seizes its opportunities for the future.  We're also innovating operationally, making our contingency plans and operations more flexible and dynamic, from Europe to the Asia-Pacific.  And we're investing to build the force of the future, as I call it – the all-volunteer force of the future.  Because as good as our technology is, it is nothing compared to our people.  Our people are the reason we have the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  And we have to ensure that the talent we recruit and retain generations from now, is just as good as the excellent people we have today."
"I made several announcements over the last few months to help to do that.  We're opening all remaining combat positions to women, very simply, so that we have access to 50 percent of our population for the all-volunteer force.  And every American who can meet our exacting standards – and that's important – will have the equal opportunity to contribute to our mission.  We're also implementing several new initiatives to improve and modernize our personnel management systems to create what I call, on ramps and off ramps that allow more people inside and outside DOD to engage with and contribute to our mission."
"People outside the defense to come in for a while, maybe not for career for a few years and contribute to the most consequential mission that a human being can contribute to, and our own people to get out and learn about how the rest of the world works and make sure that their up to date and up to speed."
"I've emphasized this, both at Silicon Valley and at our Boston technology hub.  And we're strengthening the support we provide to our military families to improve their quality of life, the emphasis here being on retention of excellent people, and where we can, making it possible for them to reconcile the needs of -- having a family with our needs of military service."
"Not always possible to reconcile, but we're making an effort where we can, consistent with the profession of arms and our needs.  There will be more to come along this line."
"Now, having told you about the budget, and particularly talking to an audience like this, I need to say something also about how we're reforming the DOD enterprise to make us more efficient.  I can't come before a group like this and ask for the amount of money that I believe we need for our defense, unless I can also satisfy you that we're spending it in the best possible way."
"Just like you have your shareholders, we have our taxpayers, and we owe it to them to ensure that we're doing everything we can to spend our defense dollars as wisely and responsibly as possible."
"That's why, along with our budget, we are keeping us our focus on, for examples, acquisition reform.  We are already starting to see results from our better buying power initiatives, and we are looking to do more and get better.  We are also doing more to reduce overhead, which we expect to help nearly eight -- provide us more than $8 billion over the next five years – eight billion dollars that we can use elsewhere for real capability and not overhead.  And we're looking at reforms to the Goldwater-Nichols Act, the famous act of the 1980s, that defines much of DOD's institutional organization. On this last point, we've been doing a thorough review for the last several months, and I expect to begin receiving recommendations on that in coming weeks and making decisions."
"Let me close by touching on the broader shift that is reflected in this budget.  For a long time, DOD tended to focus and plan and prepare for whatever big war people thought was coming over the horizon, at one point becoming so bad that after a while, it started to come at the expense of current conflicts -- long-term at the expense of the here-and-now."
"Thankfully, we were able to realize that over the decade, correct it, and turn our attention to the fights we were in.  We had to do that."
"The difference is, while that kind of singular focus may have made sense when we were facing off against the Soviets, or sending hundreds of thousands of troops to Iraq and Afghanistan, it won't work for the world we live in today.  Now we have to think and do a lot of different things about a lot of challenges the same time.  Sad to say, but true -- not just ISIL and other terrorist groups, but also competitors like Russia and China, and threats like North Korea and Iran.  We don't have the luxury of just one opponent, or the choice between current fights and future fights.  We have to do both.  And that's what this budget is designed to do."
"When this forum we're in now was founded 30 years ago, its inaugural speaker declared that “America's best days should still lie ahead.”  With this budget, and with our magnificent men and women of the Department of Defense, our best years will lie ahead.  And those men and women of the Department of Defense continue to defend our country, help make a better world for our children."
"Good morning, good morning.  Great to see you all, and I’m sorry we’re not outside but it was going to rain, but this is our auditorium, which I think doubles as a bomb shelter—I’m not really sure but… "
"Twenty-five years ago this December, the flag of the Soviet Union – an emblem of nearly half a century of nuclear competition, confrontation, and crisis – was lowered for the last time at the Kremlin and elsewhere.  Today, we come together as a community to thank some of the forward-thinking statesmen and public servants who helped make that historic moment of change far less dangerous, and to learn lessons from their work as we work to shape another era of profound global change."
"Senators Nunn and Lugar, partner nation representatives, and Defense Department personnel, past and present – thank you for coming this morning.  I also want to acknowledge Secretary Perry who was unable to travel here today.  I know we all wish he was here. "
"To appreciate the 25 years of CTR’s and its importance, we must go back in time to understand the danger that existed.  The then-Soviet Union possessed tens of thousands of nuclear weapons, and enough enriched uranium and plutonium for tens of thousands of more.  It also had 40,000 tons of chemical weapons and a deadly stockpile of biological agents ready for use.  These weapons were spread across the vast Soviet empire and in Eastern Europe too.  And as the Soviet Union reformed, then faltered, and began to disintegrate, control of this vast arsenal was thrown into doubt."
"We were able to prevent that danger from becoming a threat; that’s clear now, but I can tell you that was far from clear then.  Why is that relevant for us in the Defense Department—you all, me, and the whole department--today?  We face similarly profound and seemingly insurmountable challenges today, and this history shows we can and we will overcome them.  These threats also require new thinking of the kind that CTR represents and new ways of operating, like I’m challenging our Department to show today. "
"This was a brand new problem in those days, brand new to history. Really required new thought.  "
"It was, first of all, the first-ever disintegration of a nuclear power.  "
"And second, while people had considered accidental nuclear war since the Cuban Missile Crisis and Dr. Strangelove movie, they tended to think of the weapons systems themselves in that context, and the vital technological problems of first-strike capabilities, mutually assured destruction, and the like.  "
"But few, few appreciated nuclear command-and-control, custody, surety, and that command-and-control was more than a technical system, it was a human, social system that could not be immune to the disintegration of a society in which it was embedded.  I myself worked on command and control in my first job here at the Pentagon, at the height of the Cold War, a decade before the Soviet Union disintegrated.  "
"And Sam Nunn and Dick Lugar understood this, also, deeply from their work with Soviet Leaders on arms control over the decades before, and Sam and Dick knew that deterrence alone would not protect us against destruction in the new situation.  This new form of nuclear danger required something new. "
"Third, the very idea of the Nunn-Lugar program, which was to work with, and not against, the custodians of the former Soviet arsenal, also was novel.  After all, we had spent half a century bringing the Soviet Union to its knees…to help them, even fund them, to control the vast nuclear legacy of the USSR, seemed paradoxical to many, and it was controversial. "
"Here’s what happened next, as I remember it so clearly. "
"Sam and Dick saw impending chaos up close when Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev briefly suffered a coup and was placed under house arrest in Crimea.  They began to assemble experts to design an approach to this new problem.  And I was among them, at the time collaborating from Harvard with a Stanford faculty member named Bill Perry.  We were funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York, and you’ll see the significance of that further in a moment.  Now Sam and Dick—there’s one story I’ll tell—asked me one morning to brief the Senate leadership on the program plan, which I did.  So, being young and new to this, I stood up and talked for a while, and after a while I said, “OK, that’s enough.” And I sat down and then I proceeded to observe what was to me a fascinating conversation among the senior senators.  Nobody noticed me and ushered me out for this conversation, and at the end of it, Sam came up to me and said, “Don’t ever tell anybody what you just saw.” So I won’t.  And I haven’t."
"But, anyway, the Nunn-Lugar amendment passed and was enacted into law.  Shortly thereafter Bill Perry became Deputy Secretary of Defense and then Secretary of Defense, and I, as Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy, was put in charge of making the program work. "
"Now, let me tell you the role of our honorees today.  We brought on a number of people, whom we honor today, to handle different aspects of the program and they did it superbly and they made history: "
"Gloria Duffy, my Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense—listen up, DASDs--was then in charge of negotiating agreements with Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan and coordinating overall the program.  She’s now President of the prestigious Commonwealth Club of California. "
Susan Koch was DASD in charge of coordinating the Nunn-Lugar program with our global arms control efforts.  She’s now a Distinguished Research Fellow at the National Defense University’s Center for the Study of Weapons of Mass Destruction.  
"Liz Sherwood-Randall was a DASD in charge of overall defense relationships with Former Soviet States, all 15 of them.  She is now Deputy Secretary of Energy and couldn’t be with us today."
"And Laura Holgate.  Laura was my assistant at Harvard…she was responsible for managing the study effort that made our contribution to Nunn-Lugar.  And she flew the analysis I used at that Senate breakfast down the night before on what used to be the old shuttle at National Airport.  Laura later was Gloria’s successor as DASD for CTR.  She’s now a Special Assistant to the President and [Senior] Director of Weapons of Mass Destruction, Terrorism, and Threat Reduction at the National Security Council. "
"Jane Wales.  Jane was Chair of the Cooperative Security Program at Carnegie Corporation in New York, which David Hamburg [was] President of ... who saw the importance of this problem and funded our work.  She was later a Senior Director on the National Security Council and Special Assistant to the President at the White House helping coordinate CTR work with interagency partners.  Now, she is the CEO of the Global Philanthropy Forum, the President and CEO of the World Affairs Council, and Vice President at the Aspen Institute. "
"The achievements of Nunn-Lugar, Senator Nunn, Senator Lugar, our nominees today led to the denuclearization of Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus..  It led to a safeguarding and destruction of fissile materials.  And it led to the destruction of nuclear weapons systems, including intercontinental ballistic missiles, bombers, and submarine-launched ballistic missiles. "
"Together, with all that, the world came through a historic moment of change safely.  It certainly didn’t look likely or possible at that time.  It shows that visionary statesmanship by people like Sam Nunn and Dick Lugar – bipartisan, by the way – and superb execution by our honorees can do things that many think impossible. "
"The CTR framework continues today.  And I salute members of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency – past and present, some here today, and others watching out at Fort Belvoir – who carry on the mission.  It’s evolved.  It’s extended its focus to terrorism, not just disintegrated states.  It has extended its work to chemical and biological weapons.  And it has gone global, far beyond the borders of the former Soviet Union. "
"Today, to mark CTR’s 25th Anniversary, we are dedicating what will now be called the Nunn-Lugar Conference Room in the SecDef corridor on the E-Ring, right across from my office.  That conference room, which we’ve all used, is henceforth the Nunn-Lugar Room.  That’s a space, as you all know, in the Pentagon, where we bring together to the Defense Department senior leaders, where President Obama has held National Security Council meetings, and where we meet with outside experts to discuss how our country and our military can meet the many challenges and opportunities we face in this strategic era."
"From this day on, anyone who enters the Nunn-Lugar room – presidents and policymakers, military and civilian officials, scholars and business leaders – will walk past a plaque that reminds them of the forward-thinking programs, the bipartisan cooperation, and the enduring legacy of Senators Nunn and Lugar.  "
"And their example will inspire today’s leaders, and tomorrow’s, to take novel, even paradoxical steps, to develop new ways of thinking and operating to continue to keep the nation safe and leave our children a better world.  "
"We are also presenting the first Nunn-Lugar Trailblazer Awards to some of the members of the first team that helped bring the CTR program to life: Gloria, Susan, Liz, Laura, and Jane.  I traveled the world with this team, and many others, as we worked to realize the Nunn-Lugar vision and make the world safer.  With this award, we’re recognizing each of their contributions to history.  And we’re holding them up as an example to which we can all, and all of you in the audience, aspire…as we continue our work here to safeguard and dismantle weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems worldwide, to protect our country, and to leave a better world"

"The Department of Defense (DoD) has announced a new competition for the ""Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship"" in a recent Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) (N00014-16-R-FO12) on www.grants.gov. This program is formerly known as the National Security Science and Engineering Faculty Fellowship (NSSEFF), and both program names will be used for this round of competition during the transition phase."
"The Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship program is sponsored by the Basic Research Office, Office of Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (ASD(R&E)). The Office of Naval Research (ONR) executes the program for ASD(R&E) and is soliciting proposals. This program seeks outstanding researchers to propose basic research that is potentially transformative in topics areas of interest to the DoD. "
"“I strongly believe DoD faces some of the most exciting and difficult problems to be found in research and technology,” said Secretary of Defense Ash Carter.  “Vannevar Bush fellows will lead the way in transforming and defining new fields of science and in helping the Department look to the future.”"
"This new program name commemorates Dr. Vannevar Bush (1890-1974). He was the Director of Scientific Research and Development during World War II and the author of ""Science, The Endless Frontier.”  Bush was also a professor and Dean of Engineering at MIT and later founded a large defense and electronics company. As a devoted teacher, administrator and entrepreneur, Bush made creative and innovative contributions to science, engineering and the nation."
"During World War II, Bush mobilized America’s scientific resources to achieve advances in defense technologies that were decisive in winning the war. After the war, he was instrumental in formulating sound policies for the advancement of science, engineering and education. "
"Bush, in his famous 1945 report, ""Science: The Endless Frontier,” wrote that “the pioneer spirit is still vigorous within this nation. Science offers a largely unexplored hinterland for the pioneer who has the tools for his task.  The rewards of such exploration both for the nation and the individual are great. Scientific progress is one essential key to our security as a nation, to our better health, to more jobs, to a higher standard of living, and to our cultural progress.""  For more information on how to apply, please visit http://www.acq.osd.mil/rd/basic_research/program_info/vbff.html."
"Well, good morning, everyone.  Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to the Pentagon, and welcome to the very first public meeting of our new Defense Innovation Board."
"I want to begin by thanking the board’s chair, Eric Schmidt, for his leadership.  And I want to thank each of you – each of you, all the board members – for your willingness to serve our country in this capacity.  You represent some of America’s most innovative industries, organizations, and people.  And we’re very grateful that you’ve decided to be part of our mission here."
"As many of you have heard me say, one of my core goals as Secretary of Defense has been to push the Pentagon to think outside this wonderful five-sided box, and be more open to new ideas and new partnerships that can help our military remain what it is today – the finest fighting force the world has ever known – as we confront a changing and fiercely competitive world.  And that’s exactly why I created the Defense Innovation Board earlier this year – to advise me and future defense secretaries on how we can keep growing more competitive, stay ahead of our competitors, and stay the best, particularly by keeping DoD imbued with a culture of innovation in people, practices, organizations, and technology."
"There are several advisory boards that report to me, each with a distinctive mission and membership chosen for a distinctive kind of expertise.  The Defense Science Board, of which I was long a member, is comprised of scientists and technologists with deep expertise in weapons systems and defense R&D.  The Defense Policy Board, on which I also served, has a membership with strong foreign and defense policymaking experience.  The Defense Business Board, to name another, has members who understand DoD’s vast business expertise – I’m sorry, business enterprise – and practices.  The Defense Innovation Board has a different membership and a different role.  Its members were chosen for their record of innovation outside of the Defense Department, and for their ability to suggest innovative approaches to talent management, organizational practices and structure, technology, and global strategies that have worked in their leadership experience and that might be applicable to us."
I could not have asked for a group better qualified for this mission.  I’m grateful to these citizen-leader-innovators for taking the time from their busy schedules to do this – I don’t take it for granted – and for your selfless willingness to contribute to the defense of our nation and making a better world for our children.
"And, because of its unique role, the Defense Innovation Board may not operate exactly like the other advisory boards we have here at DoD, and that’s okay.  After all, we have to be willing to do things a little bit differently if we’re going to succeed in this mission.  And I’m going to commend members of the Innovation Board for already taking several preparatory fact-finding trips to military bases across the country, to get to know different parts of our institution – including some very innovative places in their own right.  Indeed, so far board members have spent time with airmen at Nellis Air Force Base, with sailors aboard ships docked in San Diego, with soldiers and special operators at Fort Bragg, and DIB members also visited our Central Command and Special Operations Command  in Tampa, among other DoD installations."
"I understand that as a result of this initial fact-finding – and, of course, based on the knowledge and experience each of you brings to the table from your private-sector lives, both in industry and in the academy – members of the board will discuss today some preliminary observations and interim recommendations about certain innovative practices from outside DoD that might be useful to us inside.  "
"And I’m pleased that, rather than just going off and returning with a several hundred-page report, you’re here today to share these early findings with me and the public, and to solicit feedback as you begin your work."
"I know you have a busy day ahead of you, so I’ll close by asking you to think for a moment – all of us – to reflect upon everything that America’s soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines are doing all around the world today as we sit here this morning.  "
"Right now – as we sit here in this room – our men and women in uniform are working with partners from our world-wide coalition in more ways and with more and more power every day to accelerate ISIL’s certain and lasting defeat – we saw that in Ramadi, in Hit, in Rutbah, in Qayyarah, in Makhmour, Shaddadi, and Manbij, and in the coming weeks, as we approach Mosul, Raqqa, Dabiq, and we’ll crush the fact and the idea of an Islamic state based upon ISIL’s ideology.   They’re also standing with our NATO allies, in Europe, and standing up to Russian aggression in Europe.  They’re also sailing the waters of the Asia-Pacific as part of a principled and inclusive security network – ensuring that the most consequential region for America’s future, the Asia-Pacific, remains stable, secure, and prosperous, so that all nations there can continue to rise and prosper.  They’re standing guard 24/7 on the Korean Peninsula – every day, every night – enhancing our deterrence and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s nuclear and missile provocations.  They’re countering Iran’s malign influence against our friends and allies in the Middle East.  And all the while, they’re helping to protect our homeland.  And they’re preparing us to contend with an uncertain future – ensuring we continue to be ready for challenges we may not anticipate today.  All that."
"They know, as you know, that contributing to this mission – helping to defend this great country and make a better world – is one of the noblest things a person can do with their life.  Now you have a chance to make your own contribution to that mission, and help us accomplish it.  And you can help us create excitement about the importance of our mission, and perhaps attract some more talented young Americans to serve our country – in uniform, as civilians, or in industry.  "
"So on behalf of our country and our military, I appreciate your choosing to do so – from each and every one of you.  And I look forward to seeing more of you, and hearing your final recommendations."
"SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ASH CARTER:  Good afternoon.
 It's great to be here this afternoon with a few of the dedicated people who defend our networks every day, as well as some of the technologists and hackers who have contributed to our defense mission by taking part in Hack the Pentagon, the first bug bounty of its kind in the Department of Defense [sic: in the federal government].
 Hack the Pentagon is a direct result of one of the first initiatives I announced as part of the Force of the Future.  When I created the Defense Digital Service, or DDS, I charged Chris Lynch -- right here -- with bringing in talent from America's most innovative sectors for a tour of duty to help us solve some of our most complex problems.
 They've helped us drill tunnels through the walls that too often separate the Pentagon from America's wonderful and innovative technology base, one of our nation's greatest sources of strength.
 The team of technologists at DDS has helped address some really important problems, like improving data sharing between the DOD and V.A. to make sure our veterans get access to their benefits.  Over the past several months, DDS has worked closely with Defense Media Activity and several other dedicated components within the Pentagon to achieve another important milestone, our first successful bug bounty.
 Now, bug bounties are a widespread practice in the outside world, and the concept is relatively simple:  a company offers incentives to outside researchers, what most of us would call white-hat hackers, to test the security of its networks and applications, and report what they find, so the company can fix the vulnerabilities.
 It's a challenge for the white-hat hackers -- which they like -- and it's a whole lot better for the company than learning the hard way, after the fact.  And that is, that a black-hat hacker or a nation-state has exploited vulnerabilities to steal data or destroy data, or accomplish some other nefarious purpose.
 While companies like Microsoft, and Google and Facebook have used this approach to crowdsource security for several years, no federal agency had ever offered a bug bounty.
 So we asked the question, why couldn't we use this tool to complement our -- the terrific work of our own, in-house cybersecurity experts?  And we face a competitive world, one that requires us at the Pentagon to think, as I always like to say, outside of our five-sided box, and constantly challenge ourselves to do things differently.
 Through this pilot, we found a cost-effective way to supplement and support what our dedicated people do every day to defend our systems and networks, and we've done it securely, and we've done it effectively and cost effectively, in this case.
 All told, more than 1,400 eligible hackers were invited to participate in Hack the Pentagon, and more than 250 of them found and submitted at least one vulnerability report.
 As these reports arrived, we worked to remediate them in real time with support from a contractor, HackerOne.
 Of all the submissions we received, 138 of them were determined to be legitimate, unique and eligible for a bounty.  To -- by -- and otherwise, would have been trouble, said differently.  That's why they're eligible for a reward.
 Today, a little more than a month after the pilot finished, we've remediated each and every one of these vulnerabilities found.  In total now, this pilot cost $150,000.  It's not a small sum, but if we had gone through the normal process of hiring an outside firm to do a security audit and vulnerability assessment, which is what we usually do, it would have cost us more than $1 million.
 Also, by allowing outside researchers to find holes and vulnerabilities on several sites and subdomains, we freed up our own cyber specialists to spend more time fixing them than finding them.The pilot showed us one way to streamline what we do to defend our networks and correct vulnerabilities more quickly.  
My focus on making our operations more efficient and cost-effective at DOD is one of the reasons why we're aggressive -- investing so aggressively innovation.  From innovation to people, to innovative practices, to innovative technologies and through Hack the Pentagon, we've combined all three of those elements and to considerable success.
 Beyond the security fixes we've made, we've built stronger bridges to innovative citizens who want to make a difference to our defense mission.  Individuals from across 44 states joined the bug bounty and submitted reports, and I'm pleased that two of our bug bounty participants have joined us today;Craig Arendt right here -- this guy -- and David Dworkin , that guy right there.  There's two of our bounty men.
 Craig is a prolific security researcher who helped us identify a number of vulnerabilities and David is a high school student who lives right here in the Washington area.  For them and many others, this was about more than a reward or a bounty, it was about an opportunity to contribute to making our country safer.
 Wherever I go around the innovative hubs of this country, I find that people in the most innovative parts of our economy and society and there because they want to do things that truly matter -- and they know that national security really matters.  They want to spend their energies on issues of consequence and we have plenty of them.
 There's also a sense of responsibility they have that comes with their knowledge and technical expertise.  That's a lesson that was imparted to me, in my own career, by many of my older scientists and a lesson that many technologists and innovators appreciate today.
 But while many of our nation's innovators are motivated by this spirit, they too often lack avenues to channel it.  For instance, when it comes to the security of DOD networks and systems, there's no reporting mechanism, no standing reporting mechanism or pathway for them to tell us where we might be vulnerable, and sometimes there are legal hurdles to that.
 This bug bounty provides one such pathway, but as another way  to build on Hack the Pentagon's success, we're doing something else.  First, creating a central point of contact – a standing point of contact for researchers and technologists to safely and securely submit information about DOD security gaps that they come upon.
 And second, we're working to expand bug bounty programs to other parts of the department so that the security benefits  DMA has worked to achieve through this pilot can be replicated in other parts of our enterprise.  I'm directing all DOD components to review where bug bounties can be used by them as a valuable tool in their own security tool kit.
 And third, we're going to include incentives in our acquisition guidance and policies so that contractors who work on DOD systems can also take advantage of innovative approaches to cybersecurity testing.  For example, in some circumstances, we will encourage contractors to make their technologies available for independent security reviews such as bug bounties before they deliver them to us.  This will help them make their code more secure from the start, and before it's installed on our system.
 So, by offering U.S. researchers an avenue, albeit with important safeguards, for reporting vulnerabilities and gaps, we've done more with this pilot than make our networks more secure for the short term.  We've built relationships of trust for the long term.  We've provided a road map for other government departments and agencies to crowd-source their own security.
 When it comes to information and technology, the defense establishment usually relies on closed systems.  But the more friendly eyes we have on some of our systems and websites, the more gaps we can find, the more vulnerabilities we can fix, and the greater security we can provide to our warfighters.
 We know that state-sponsored actors and black-hat hackers want to challenge and exploit our networks.  We know that.  What we didn't fully appreciate before this pilot was how many white-hat hackers there are who want to make a difference, who want to help keep our people and our nation safer.
 I want to take a moment now to personally thank -- congratulate the two individuals who participated in the bug bounty, thank all the folks from the department who created Hack the Pentagon, and then I'll take a few questions from you all before I get a chance to take David and Craig back once again and chat a little bit more in my office.
 So with that, where are we here?
 (CROSSTALK)
 SEC. CARTER:  Okay.  Look at this guy.  Look at this guy.  Did you own a suit like that in high school?
 (Laughter.)
 (APPLAUSE)
 It's not a suit, but it's still pretty sharp looking.
 And Chris never wears a suit.
 (CROSSTALK)
 STAFF:  All right.  The secretary's got time for two questions -- (inaudible) -- wrap up.

 STAFF:  Mr. Secretary -- (inaudible).
 STAFF:  Tara's got the first question.
 SEC. CARTER:  Okay.  Tara?
 Q:  Mr. Secretary, on Hack the Pentagon, would you please tell us what kind of vulnerabilities you found and what kind of risks they posed to the Pentagon?
 And then on Fallujah, could you confirm for us that ISF has entered and retaken Fallujah?  And give us a little bit of a detail on what sort of role U.S. advisers had in supporting this operation?
 SEC. CARTER:  Sure.  And I can actually give you a better answer to the second part than the first part.  You've got the right people here.  I'll let Chris answer the first part a little bit later, Tara.
 But it's a wide range of vulnerabilities, and he can sort of spell them out.  But the good thing about this is they're reported to us.  These are ones we weren't aware of.  And now we have the opportunity to fix them.  And again, it's a lot better than either hiring somebody to do that for you, or finding out the hard way.  But I'll let Chris talk about the variety of bugs.
 With respect to Fallujah, ISF forces have entered the city.  They are in control of a portion of the city.  I think it's too early to say all of the city.  They have done that under the command of Prime Minister Abadi, and with the support of the United States, including -- and to -- in response to your question, all kinds of support.
 But advice and assistance, and air support, and all the other enablers that were -- we provide for the Iraqi Security Forces, or at least the ones that they requested in this particular case.
 So, this is an important objective, and it's important that it was accomplished by the Iraqi Security Forces under the command of Prime Minister Abadi, because that's an important principle for us, for Iraq to be -- put itself back together as a whole in the long run.
 But they -- it will -- their -- I can't tell you that the entire city is under the control of the ISF.  This -- there's still some fighting to be done, I'm sure.  But there is a -- a portion of the city, and I think that that has been reported by the Iraqi government who are commanding the operation.
 STAFF:  Mr. -- (inaudible).
 Q:  (off-mic)
 STAFF:  Go ahead.
 Q:  Mr. Secretary, tell us what you know about this Russian attack on a U.S.-backed group of opposition fighters in Southern Syria.  And do you think it was deliberate?  And what do you plan to do about it?
 SEC. CARTER:  We have.  I -- we -- I can tell you what we -- I know on the basis of the reports that we've received so far.
 This was an attack on forces, first of all, that were fighting ISIL.  And obviously, that's the first thing that's problematic about this Russian conduct, because if you go back, remember, the Russians initially said that they were coming in to fight ISIL.
 And that's not what they did.  Now, this -- they mostly supported Assad and fueled the civil war.  But here's a case where they actually attacked forces that were -- were fighting ISIL.
 And if that's the -- their -- it was their intention, that's the opposite of what they said they were going to do.  If not, then it's -- says something about the quality of the information upon which they make airstrikes.
 And the other thing is that the channel that we have to communicate with them in instances like this wasn't professionally used.  So, we're trying to (inaudible) clarify the facts and use that channel with the Russians to understand what went on there.
 But that's what we know at this time.
 (CROSSTALK)
 Q:  Mr. Secretary, yesterday, the CIA director testified that despite some 13,000 coalition airstrikes over the past two years against ISIS, denying them territory and constraining their finances, ISIS has become more connected as a global organization.  Its terror capacity remains undiminished.
 (Inaudible) -- 13,000 airstrikes, the very feature -- excuse me, 13,000 airstrikes hadn't diminished the very feature that -- of the group that most Americans find concerning, its terrorism capability
shouldn't the coalition strategy be seen as fundamentally failing?
 SEC. CARTER:  Well, the -- the strategy has three parts to it, of which the campaign in Iraq and Syria, which is showing results is necessary but not sufficient.
 It is essential that we destroy ISIL in Iraq and Syria, but that's not going to constitute the end of ISIL and the terrorist threat it poses to the United States.  That's absolutely right.  There are other places around the world to which ISIL has spread and then we have to protect our own homeland as well, which is mostly a law enforcement and intelligence matter, but we try to support where we can.
 So one has to do all of those things, that's absolutely right, in order to protect us from ISIL, and those are the -- the -- the part of the campaign plan that we outlined some year ago or so.
 Thank you all very much.  Appreciate it."
"All, right.  Well, listen, thank you, Dr. Ronis – appreciate it.  Good evening, everyone.  What a terrific video about our honorees, and I'm honored to be here to, in turn, honor them.   "
"It’s good to be with all of you, a lot of colleagues past and present, servicemembers, friends.  General Selva, Paul, are you out there?  Paul, Ricky, nice to be with you, as always.  Thanks for holding down the fort while I was away.  I’m also glad Norm Augustine is here with his wife Meg.  Norm, good to see you and Meg, always, always…and also to learn that the men and women of the defense industry of the United States are also being honored this evening – more about that later.  Norm and I have known each other for decades – decades now, Norm.  And I remain, for one here, a devoted reader of Augustine’s Laws.  "
"Norm and I attended the so-called “Last Supper” in 1993 when the Pentagon and industry set the course for our relationship in the post-Cold War period.  I’ve said it many times before, but for decades the Department and the defense industry have worked together on the national security team.  I always tell people we don’t make anything at the Pentagon.  The Soviet Union tried that, and it didn’t work out very well for them.  We have a different system, and the companies and the men and women of the defense industry are part of our strength, so I’m glad to see them honoring that fact tonight, and you, Norm and Meg, good to see you."
"And I also want to thank Dr. Ronis, Larry Rzepka – wherever Larry went, and all the representatives from our National Defense University and the NDU Foundation here tonight – for all you do to educate and support those who serve.  And thank you, as well, for honoring them with this recognition.  I’m, in turn, honored to accept the NDU Foundation American Patriot Award today on behalf of them – the men and women of the Department of Defense…soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, civilians, and contractors.  "
"Together – together, they make up the finest fighting force the world has ever known, one we should all take pride in and be thankful for.  All of them – each and every one – are doing one of the noblest things a person can do, which is to help defend our country and to make a better world for our children.  "
"To do so, they’re confronting – right here, right now as we speak here this evening – five major, unique, and evolving challenges. "
"They’re countering, first, the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, particularly in Europe, where I was just this morning, for a meeting with our NATO Allies in Brussels.  "
"They’re managing historic change in the Asia-Pacific – the single most consequential region for America’s future.  They’re strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s continued nuclear and missile provocations.  They’re checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Gulf, and helping defend our friends and allies in the Middle East.  And they’re accelerating the certain defeat of ISIL…in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria; as well as in Afghanistan, Libya, and everywhere else the ISIL cancer metastasizes around the world; and by helping to protect our homeland and our people here.  "
"Indeed, I was in Iraq earlier this week, visiting with our troops in Baghdad and Erbil, which isn’t far from Mosul, where American personnel are advising and enabling our Iraqi partners in the fight against ISIL.  I saw firsthand how they’re continuing to perform with excellence at this milestone in our campaign.  And I was encouraged by how our coalition military campaign plan, particularly the Iraqi-led assault on Mosul, is proceeding according to the plan – the plan we laid out a year ago.  And make no mistake:  Raqqa is next."
"Now, the Defense Department doesn’t have the luxury of choosing among these five challenges – we have to do it all.  And, of course, we must be flexible and agile, because, no matter how excellent NDU studies are, when you look at history, you see that we have an almost unblemished record of failure when it comes to predicting the strategic future.  So we’re preparing to contend, in addition, with an uncertain future – ensuring that our personnel and the Defense Department continue to be ready for challenges we may not anticipate today. "
"To meet those five challenges and in the face of that unknown future, DoD is taking steps to remain the most powerful military on earth.  To ensure we do so, to ensure we take care of our people, to ensure we have the right plans and strategies in place, and to ensure we’re prepared for whatever comes our way, I’ve been working every day to meet the three commitments I made when I was sworn in…two years ago now, I guess, and which every Secretary of Defense I’ve ever known – and I’ve worked for 11 of them, with 11 of them – make."
"And the first, as Secretary of Defense, my first commitment is to our honorees tonight – to our personnel, our men and women, uniform and civilian – to their excellence, to their welfare, to making sure they’re treated with dignity and respect, and above all, making certain that when they’re sent into harm’s way, it’s done with the utmost care and purpose.  "
"I’m doing everything I can to support the strength and readiness of today’s fighting force, so they can confront those five challenges – investing in the right training, the right equipment, the right force size, and the right compensation.  "
"What that means is, we’re training our force to be ready for full-spectrum combat.  We’re providing them the equipment and maintenance support needed to get the job done and come home safely.  We’re ensuring the right mix of active, guard, and reserve across the force.  And we’re providing the compensation and benefits that our troops, military families, and DoD civilians deserve.    "
"But our support for today’s force also involves more than that, it also includes our commitment to help care for our military’s wounded, ill, and injured and support our military families, because they serve too.  "
"It includes our enduring pledge to support the families of the fallen, whose loved ones made the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of our country.  It also includes our pledge to support our servicemembers when they move on to whatever’s next for them so they can succeed in every way possible.  And it also means that when our servicemembers are not being treated fairly, and with respect, we act quickly to fix it, as we’ve done with the California National Guard bonus issue this week."
"Of course, our commitment to today’s force also includes what we’re doing to ensure the dignity of our people, which is why we’ve been prioritizing the prevention and elimination of sexual harassment and sexual assault in the military.  "
"And it also means we have to be open up to all Americans who can meet the high standards of our force, because our strength as an all-volunteer force depends on drawing the best from the widest possible pool of talent that can meet our standards.  That’s why we opened up all remaining combat roles to women, and we’re welcoming transgender Americans to serve openly. "
"Of course, America’s military deserves only the finest leaders.  And that’s why the best decisions I’ve made as Secretary of Defense have been my recommendations to the President on nominations for the leadership of the force.  That includes the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joe Dunford, Vice Chairman Paul Selva, who’s here tonight as I mentioned, and the rest of the Joint Chiefs, and by now, eight out of our nine combatant commanders – proudest decisions. "
"Understanding the strength of our force and our capabilities helps me honor my second commitment, which is to the President of the United States and our Commander-in-Chief – to offer President Obama my best strategic counsel, to ensure that he receives candid military advice, and to execute his decisions with DoD’s expected and accustomed excellence.  "
"We’ve done so on each of the five challenges we face.  In Europe, we’ve developed – and we’re implementing – a strong and balanced strategy to deter Russian aggression against our NATO allies in Europe.  In the Asia-Pacific, we’ve crafted the latest phase of our rebalance to that region, and now we’re operationalizing it and catalyzing the region’s burgeoning principled and inclusive security network.  In the face of North Korea’s continued aggression, we’ve modernized our alliances with Japan and South Korea, deployed new capabilities to defend our allies, our forces, and our homeland, and reaffirmed that our extended deterrence commitments are unbreakable.  "
"In the Middle East, as the United States continues to monitor Iran’s adherence to the nuclear accord, we’re taking our defense relationships with Israel and our Gulf partners to new levels.  And on ISIL, one year ago, President Obama approved the first in a series of recommendations by me and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joe Dunford, to begin gathering momentum in the fight against ISIL.  "
"We’ve achieved significant results to date – helping our local partners in Iraq and Syria to recapture Ramadi, Hit, Fallujah, Qayyarah, Shaddadi, Manbij, Dabiq, and more, and now…now execute our plans for Mosul and Raqqa.  And I’m confident our campaign plan, our global coalition, and the local partners we’ve developed and enabled will help deliver ISIL the lasting defeat it deserves and will surely get."
"Meanwhile – even as we’ve been executing all those missions – we’ve also been laying the groundwork and charting a path for a more agile, innovative, and efficient military and Defense Department to serve and protect our nation in the years to come.  And that’s because my third commitment – after our people and our Commander-in-Chief – is to the future…to keeping our military edge as sharp as possible in a changing and fiercely competitive world.  "
"And to stay ahead of our competitors and challenges – to stay the best – I’ve been pushing the Pentagon to think outside of our five-sided box…to invest aggressively in innovation of all kinds:  in our technology, in our operations, in our people and all-volunteer force, and in our organization. "
"That’s why we’re making increased investments in science and technology, and building new bridges to the amazing American innovative system – to stay ahead of future threats.  It’s why we’re also innovating operationally, making our contingency plans and operations more flexible and more dynamic in every region.  "
"It’s why we’re building what I’ve called the Force of the Future – because as good as our technology is, it’s nothing compared to our people, and in the future we need to continue to recruit, develop, and retain the very best talent from future generations.  And because we owe it to America’s taxpayers to spend our defense dollars as wisely and responsibly as possible, we’re also pushing for needed reforms across the DoD enterprise – from continuously improving acquisitions, to further reducing overhead, and to proposing new changes to the Goldwater-Nichols Act that defines much of our institutional organization. "
"Because we’re doing all this – because we’re meeting these three commitments – and because of our nation’s enduring strengths – like, our growing, innovative economy, our world-class universities – places of instruction like NDU, our dedication and service to values and principles, our unrivaled network of allies and partners, and of course, our unmatched, battle-tested, innovative, and awesomely capable military, because of all that, I’m sure that the future for our country is bright and full of opportunities for our nation to seize.  "
"And I am confident that the United States will maintain our unrivaled military strength for decades and remain the world’s foremost leader, partner, and provider of security in every region across the globe."
"But I never forget – and we can never forget – who makes it all happen.  And you know the answer…because you chose to honor them tonight…it’s our people.  And we have a few of them here with us.  And let’s give them a round of applause, and would they stand?  Paul, you’re going to need to lead the way here."
"Each of you, and each of your fellow servicemembers and DoD civilians, make me incredibly proud – make this country proud.  You’re some of the nearly 3 million men and women serving across this country and around the clock, in every time zone on earth, and in every domain…in the air, ashore, afloat, and in cyberspace – all in service to this great nation."
"All of you are defending not only the United States and its people; you’re also defending the values and principles that define us – and which, by the way, so much of humanity also desires – while you provide the security that will enable our children to live a better future.  "
"Because you do so, we can sit here and enjoy this dinner in peace.  We can go to work tomorrow or study at schools like NDU.  Americans  can live our lives, they can dream our dreams, and enjoy the freedoms upon which this country was built, and for which so many generations of Americans have fought.   "
"You make all that possible.  And at a time when not as many serve, I want you to know that we don’t take you for granted.  Stephanie and I wake up to you every morning…wake up for you every morning, thinking of you.  I know that our mission is demanding and constantly changing, but I couldn’t be prouder of you for what you do every day – and for all you’ve done for us.  "
Your excellence is unparalleled.  Your service is valued.  And your sacrifices will never be forgotten.  
"May God bless you, and all men and women of the finest fighting force the world has ever known – and may God bless the United States of America.   "
"Thank you very much, Chairman Thornberry. Congresswoman Davis, thank you. Thanks to all Members of the Committee. Thanks for hosting me here today."
"I want to begin by condemning this morning’s bombings in Belgium.  Our thoughts and our prayers are with those affected by this tragedy – the victims, their families, and the survivors.  And in the face of these acts of terrorism, the United States stands in strong solidarity with our ally Belgium."
"We’re continuing to monitor the situation, including to ensure that all U.S. personnel and citizens are accounted for.  We also stand ready to provide assistance to our friends and allies in Europe as necessary."
"Brussels is an international city that has been host to NATO and to the European Union for decades.  Together, we must and we will continue to do everything we can to protect our homelands and defeat terrorists wherever they threaten us.  No attack will affect our resolve to accelerate the defeat of ISIL.  I’ll have more to say about this later in the testimony."
"Thank you again for hosting me today, and for steadfastly supporting DoD’s men and women all over the world – military and civilian – who serve and defend us.  I’m pleased to be here with Chairman Dunford and Under Secretary McCord to discuss President Obama’s 2017 defense budget, which marks a major inflection point for the Department of Defense.  As I will describe in detail, the threat from terrorism is one of the five challenges, as has been noted, that the United States now faces and will in the future."
"In this budget, we’re taking the long view.  We have to, because even as we fight today’s fights, we must also be prepared for what might come 10, 20, or 30 years down the road.  Last fall’s Bipartisan Budget Act gave us some much-needed stability after years of gridlock and turbulence, and I want to thank you and your colleagues for coming together to help pass it.  That budget deal set the size of our budget, and with this degree of certainty we focused on its shape – changing that shape in fundamental but carefully considered ways to adjust to a new strategic era, and to seize opportunities for the future."
"Let me describe the strategic assessment that drove our budget decisions.  First of all, it’s evident that America is still today the world’s foremost leader, partner, and underwriter of stability and security in every region of the world, as we have been since the end of World War II.  That’s thanks in large part to the unequivocal strength of the U.S. military.  And as we continue to fulfill this enduring role, it’s also evident that we’re entering a new strategic era.  Today’s security environment is dramatically different from the last 25 years, requiring new ways of investing and operating.  Five evolving strategic challenges – namely Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, and terrorism – are now driving DoD’s planning and budgeting as reflected in this budget."
"I want to focus first on our ongoing fight against terrorism, and especially ISIL – which, as the attacks in Belgium today again remind us, we must and will deal a lasting defeat, most immediately in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, but also where it’s metastasizing.  And all the while, we’re continuing to help protect our own homeland."
"Let me give you a quick snapshot of what we’re doing to pressure and destroy ISIL’s parent tumor in Iraq and Syria.  In Iraq, with our support, the Iraqi Security Forces retook Ramadi, and are now reclaiming further ground in Anbar Province, and are simultaneously shifting the weight of their effort toward Mosul in the north.  With our advice and assistance, Iraqi and Kurdish Security Forces have begun the shaping and isolation phase of the operation to collapse ISIL’s control over Mosul.  That was the mission Marine Staff Sergeant Louis Cardin was supporting when he gave his life over the weekend – providing critical protection to Iraqi forces and coalition military advisors in northern Iraq.  Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, and with the other Marines injured in Saturday’s rocket attack.  Their sacrifice will not be forgotten, and our global coalition will complete the mission they were supporting."
"In Syria, capable and motivated local forces supported by the United States and our global coalition have retaken the east Syrian town of Shaddadi.  This town served as an important logistical and financial hub for ISIL and a key intersection between its Syria and Iraq operations.  In fact, Shaddadi was so important to ISIL that its so-called Minister of War was involved in ISIL’s defense of the town.  We killed him, while our local partners expelled ISIL from the town.  In doing so, the coalition campaign severed the last major northern artery between Raqqa and Mosul, and therefore between ISIL in Syria and ISIL in Iraq.  And we’re intent on further isolating and pressuring ISIL, including by cutting off its remaining lines of communications in southern Syria and into Turkey.  "
"In addition to local forces we’re working with, 90 percent of our military coalition partners – from Europe, the Gulf, Asia; 26 countries in all, including, by the way, our ally Belgium – have committed to increase their contributions to help accelerate the defeat of ISIL.  We’ve increased strikes on ISIL-held cash depots, oil revenues, and sites associated with its ambitions to develop and use chemical weapons.  And we’re addressing ISIL’s metastasis as well, having conducted targeted strikes against ISIL in Libya and Afghanistan."
"As we’re accelerating our overall counter-ISIL campaign, we’re backing it up with increased funding for 2017, as the Chairman already noted – requesting 50 percent more than last year."
"Now, before I continue, I want to say a few words about Russia’s role in this.  Russia said it was coming into Syria to fight ISIL, but that’s not what it did.  Instead, their military has only prolonged the civil war, propped up Assad, and as of now, we haven’t seen whether Russia has retained leverage over Assad to facilitate a diplomatic way forward, which is what the Syrian people need."
"One thing is clear, though.  Russia’s entry into Syria didn’t impact our campaign against ISIL.  Along with our coalition partners, we’re intensifying our campaign against ISIL in both Iraq and Syria, and we’ll continue to do so until ISIL is dealt a lasting defeat."
"Two of the other four challenges reflect a return, in some ways, to great superpower competition.  One is in Europe, where we’re taking a strong and balanced approach to deter Russian aggression – we haven’t had to devote a significant portion of our defense investment to this possibility for nearly a quarter-century, but now we do.  The other challenge is in the Asia-Pacific, where China is rising, which is fine, but behaving aggressively, which is not.  There, we’re continuing our rebalance to the region to maintain the stability we’ve underwritten for the past 70 years, enabling so many nations to rise and prosper in this, the single most consequential region for America’s future."
"Meanwhile, two other longstanding challenges pose threats in specific regions.  North Korea is one – that’s why our forces on the Korean Peninsula remain ready, as they say, to “fight tonight.”  The other is Iran, because while the nuclear accord is a good deal for preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, we must still deter Iranian aggression and counter Iran’s malign influence against our regional friends and allies, especially Israel, to which we maintain an unwavering and unbreakable commitment."
"Now, addressing all of these five challenges requires new investments on our part, new posture in some regions, and also new and enhanced capabilities.  For example, we know we must deal with these challenges across all domains – and not just the usual air, land, and sea, but also especially in cyber, electronic warfare, and space, where our reliance on technology has given us great strengths and great opportunities, but also led to vulnerabilities that adversaries are eager to exploit."
"Key to our approach is being able to deter our most advanced competitors.  We must have – and be seen to have – the ability to ensure that anyone who starts a conflict with us will regret doing so.  In our budget, our capabilities, our readiness, and our actions, we must and will be prepared for a high-end enemy – what we call full-spectrum."
"In this context, Russia and China are our most stressing competitors, as they’ve both developed and continue to advance military systems that seek to threaten our advantages in specific areas.  We see them in the South China Sea, and in Crimea and in Syria as well.  In some cases, they’re developing weapons and ways of war that seek to achieve their objectives rapidly, before they think we can respond.  Because of this, DoD has elevated their importance in our planning and budgeting."
"In my written testimony, I’ve detailed how our budget makes critical investments to help us better address these five evolving challenges.  We’re strengthening our deterrence posture in Europe by investing $3.4 billion for our European Reassurance Initiative – quadruple what we requested last year.  We’re prioritizing training and readiness for our ground forces very important matter, emphasized, very appropriately, by the Chairman – and reinvigorating the readiness and modernization of our fighter aircraft fleet.  We’re investing in innovative capabilities like the B-21 long-range strike bomber, microdrones, and the arsenal plane, as well as advanced munitions of all sorts.  In our Navy, we’re emphasizing not just increasing the number of ships, which we’re doing, but especially their lethality, with new weapons and high-end ships, and extending our commanding lead in undersea warfare – with new investments in unmanned undersea vehicles, for example, and more submarines with the versatile Virginia Payload Module that triples their strike capacity from 12 Tomahawks to 40.  And we’re doing more in cyber, electronic warfare, and space – investing in these three domains a combined total of $34 billion in 2017.  Among other things, this will help build our cyber mission force, develop next-generation electronic jammers, and prepare for the possibility of a conflict that extends into space.  In short, DoD will keep ensuring our dominance in all domains."
"As we do this, our budget also seizes opportunities for the future.  That’s a responsibility I have to all my successors – to ensure the military and the Defense Department they inherit is just as strong, if not stronger, than the one I have the privilege of leading today."
"That’s why we’re making increased investments in science and technology, innovating operationally, and building new bridges to the amazing American innovative system – as we always have, to stay ahead of future threats.  That’s why we’re building what I’ve called the Force of the Future – because as good as our technology is, it’s nothing compared to our people, and in the future we must continue to recruit and retain the very best talent.  Competing for good people for an all-volunteer force is a critical part of our military edge, and everyone should understand this need and my commitment to meeting it."
"And because we owe it to America’s taxpayers to spend our defense dollars as wisely and responsibly as possible, we’re also pushing for needed reforms across the DoD enterprise, and we need your help with all of them – from further reducing overhead and excess infrastructure, to modernizing and simplifying TRICARE, to proposing new changes to the Goldwater-Nichols Act that defines much of our institutional organization, as I intend to do shortly, to continuously improving acquisitions."
"And on that subject, I want to commend this committee, and especially its leaders, for your continued dedication and strong partnership with DoD on acquisition reform.  We’ve already taken important strides here, such as last year’s reforms to reduce redundant reporting requirements and documentation.  And as you’re looking to do more, so are we."
"Chairman Thornberry, I know you laid out new proposals on this last week.  Some of what you’re proposing would save us critical time in staying ahead of emerging threats.  That’s very important and we appreciate that.  It’s extremely helpful.  I know this is just a draft, and I appreciate that you put it out there for discussion.  In that regard, I have to say that in the current draft, there are some things that are problematic for us.  So I’m also hopeful that we can continue to work with you on your proposals to ensure that DoD has the flexibility needed to apply the principles in your work to addressing all the diverse acquisition challenges we have to solve for our warfighters.  I appreciate your willingness to hear our ideas as well – including ways to make it easier for program managers to do their jobs, and involving the service chiefs more in acquisition decision-making and accountability – and I look forward to working together as we have before."
"Let me close on the broader shift reflected in this budget.  The Defense Department doesn’t have the luxury of just one opponent, or the choice between fights – between future fights and current fights – we have to do it all.  That’s what this budget is designed to do – and we need your help to succeed."
"I thank this committee again for supporting the Bipartisan Budget Act that set the size of our budget.  Our submission focuses on the budget’s shape, making changes that are necessary and consequential.  We hope you approve it.  I know some may be looking at the difference between what we indicated last year we would be asking for and what the budget deal gave us – a net total of about $11 billion less is provided by the Bipartisan Budget Act out of a total of almost $600 billion – but I want to reiterate that we’ve mitigated that difference, and that this budget meets our needs.  The budget deal was a good deal; it gave us stability.  We’re grateful for that.  Our greatest risk, DoD’s greatest risk, is losing that stability this year, and having uncertainty and sequester return in future years.  That’s why going forward, the biggest budget priority for us strategically is Congress averting the return of sequestration – to prevent what would be $100 billion in looming automatic cuts – so that we can maintain stability and sustain all these critical investments I’ve been speaking of."
"We’ve seen this before, and that same support, coming together, is essential today – to address the security challenges we face, and to seize the opportunities within our grasp.  As long as we work together to do so, I know our national security will be on the right path, and America’s military will continue to defend our country and help make a better world for generations to come."
"Thank you, thank you. And what a beautiful, beautiful song. Thanks so much. Really appreciate it."
"Good evening, everyone."
"President Rivlin; Prime Minister Netanyahu; Minister Lieberman, my friend; General Eizenkot; General Eshel; ladies and gentlemen:  it’s a pleasure to be back in Israel, and to join all of you here at Nevatim for this historic ceremony.  "
"This evening, we’re celebrating the remarkable progress of the U.S.-Israel defense relationship, and also of an air force that began by flying leftover World War II planes and is now flying the most advanced aircraft in history.  "
"These F-35 stealth fighters are the first of 50 aircraft that will help build the future of the Israeli Air Force, and that’s thanks to a historic Memorandum of Understanding we signed this year in which the U.S. pledged an unprecedented $38 billion in security assistance over the next decade."
"And as of today, Israel is our first and only friend in the region that’s flying the F-35.  And it’s my honor to be here marking the delivery of these planes, the Adir, to America’s closest friend and ally in the region."
"During my time as Secretary of Defense, I’ve traveled across this nation – from the northern border under threat from Hezbollah, to Nevatim here in the south today.  And during these visits, I’ve seen firsthand some of threats you face daily from many different directions.  "
"That’s one of the many reasons why the United States is committed to providing Israel with the most advanced military capabilities critical, not only to ensure Israel can defend itself but also to maintain its qualitative military edge.  And of course, there’s no better symbol of the U.S. commitment to Israel’s security than the F-35, the most capable aircraft in the skies."
"I’m told that in Hebrew, Adir means “mighty one” – which is an apt name for aircraft that represent the full force of military might.  From its stealth technology to its fighter capabilities, the F-35 will allow pilots to evade detection and fly at supersonic speeds while conducting air defense; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; and ground attack missions.  It also features advanced sensors and data collection capabilities that allow it to share data with other aircraft.  These information-sharing features, in particular, make it an ideal aircraft for joint and coalition operations, which will help the U.S. and Israel air forces operate more jointly – and more effectively – than ever before.  Together, we will dominate the skies."
"As we celebrate Israel’s new F-35s this evening, it’s worth noting how important Israeli companies – as well as U.S. companies – were to the creation of this state-of-the-art aircraft.  From wing production to the helmet-mounted display to fuselage components, Israel’s innovative technologies have helped define this aircraft and its capabilities.  That’s one example, of many, that shows how our partnership benefits the security of both of our nations."
"While the F-35 is an important symbol of the America’s commitment to Israel’s qualitative military edge, it’s only the most recent example of how our security cooperation continues to soar to new heights."
"We’re maintaining robust military assistance and funding critical missile defense systems like the Iron Dome, David’s Sling, and Arrow, to name a few.  We’ve also expanded our cooperation into new domains – including space and cyberspace in the last few years – to prepare for 21st century threats.  And we’ll continue to provide Israel with the most advanced capabilities – including more F-35 Adirs – to further sharpen its qualitative military edge."
"As we gather here today, the U.S.-Israel defense relationship is stronger than it’s ever been, and America’s pledge to defend Israel’s security remains unwavering.  "
"Indeed, with the current turmoil in the region, we’re more committed to Israel’s security today than ever before.  And from World War II surplus at the dawn of the Israeli state to stealth fighters today, the United States will continue to stand by its ally and friend Israel – as we have from the very beginning – as we have from the very beginning and will continue to do so long into the future.  "
"            STAFF:  Good afternoon and welcome to today's swearing-in ceremony in honor of Dr. Heather Wilson, Secretary of the Air Force."
"            Ladies and gentleman, the Secretary of Defense, James M. Mattis, the Secretary of the Air Force, Heather A. Wilson, and General David L. Goldfein, chief of staff of the Air Force. (Applause.)"
"            (SINGING ""STAR SPANGLED BANNER"")"
            (Applause.)
"            STAFF: Ladies and gentleman, General Goldfein."
"GENERAL DAVID L. GOLDFEIN:  Secretary Mattis, distinguished guests, fellow joint teammates, family and friends, it is an absolute honor to welcome Dr. Heather Wilson as out 24th Secretary of the Air Force, along with her husband Jay and her son Josh."
"Secretary Wilson and I first served together as cadets at the United States Air Force Academy.  Almost 40 years ago, we stood together in the field house and took our oath of office for the first time -- the same oath Dr. Wilson has repeated throughout her distinguished Air Force career, and the same oath she took as she was sworn in as a congresswoman from the great state of New Mexico."
"            And here we stand together again, as you repeat these same sacred words.  What a journey it has been, and what a journey it will be.  "
            We follow in the footsteps of service secretaries and chiefs of the past who have put their heart and soul into building the most combat-capable and lethal Air Force the world has ever known.  
"            The names are familiar because we studied them together at the academy.  Symington and Spaatz; Orr and Allen; Peters and Ryan; Secretary Wynne, who was here today, and General Moseley; and Donnelly and General Schwartz, who is also with us; and today begins the era of Wilson and Goldfein.  "
"            While we face the complex and dangerous national security environment where air and space power are in great demand, others before us have faced similar challenges.  "
"            Working together in an executive team, they organized, trained, equipped and presented ready forces to combatant commanders to capture the high ground and win our nation's battles as we simultaneously protected the homeland.  "
"            And under your leadership, Madam Secretary, we will do the same.  "
"            Of all the words in our sacred oath, perhaps the most important are ""we take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion.""  You did not have to take on this responsibility, and no doubt, there were a few nights when you and Jay looked out of your residence at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology and questioned why you would leave your dream job to go back into government service."
"But, ma'am, your airmen know why.  It's the same reason you left home to join the Air Force in 1978.  It's the same reason you ran for office and served in our Congress.  It's what drives you, because it was ingrained in our character at the Air Force Academy:  integrity first, service before self, excellence in all we do."
"Service before self:  ma'am, your nation has called you back to duty, and it is my distinct honor to represent the over 660,000 active-duty Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve and civilian airmen as we welcome you, Jay and Josh back to your Air Force."
"            We're proud to follow you, and I'm honored to fly on your wing once again, these four decades later.  "
"            And it is now my honor to introduce our Secretary of Defense, a man who knows a bit about service and duty, the Honorable James Mattis.  "
            Sir.  (Applause.)
"            SECRETARY OF DEFENSE JIM MATTIS:  Well, thank you, General.  And, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for being here.  "
"            General Goldfein, it's great to see the Air Force under your uniform leadership, and to bring you a wing man who knows something about the Air Force, to say the least.  "
"            But to Jay and to Josh, thank you for sticking with us through the usual injurious confirmation process.  You've already shown you have the right stuff, just like your mother does, Josh.  "
"            And I would just say to Senator Kurtz, Secretary Wynne, Undersecretary Zakheim -- I saw him here -- General Schwartz, General Moseley -- all of you who are here, if we wanted to do one thing to Webster's Unabridged Dictionary to define a patriot with no words, we could put up Heather Wilson's picture right next to the word, and we would explain what a patriot truly is.  "
"            And certainly, leaving a dream job somewhere west of the Potomac is something I can identify with.  But I'd just say, on -- on behalf of Secretary Wilson -- and it's lovely to call you that, Secretary Wilson -- on behalf of the entire Air Force community, on behalf of the Department of Defense, welcome home."
"            Before us, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, is someone whose personal story mirrors America's coming of age and our times.  She's an east-coaster, a Granite Stater who went west to go to college.  She went west to Colorado and came out an Air Force officer from the Air Force Academy and grew up in service to our country.  "
"            And it's interesting to look at her service as being at a hinge in history for the Air Force, for our nation and for the world.  She's been at the hinge each time.  She was one of the first women to graduate from the Air Force Academy.  She's one of the first to earn a degree as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford; to serve as a female veteran in Congress.  A cold warrior, she worked in the White House National Security Council when the Berlin wall was swept down."
"            Infused throughout this service is a continual quest for wisdom, often conducted in exalted institutions, whether in the shadow of the Rockies, on the banks of the Thames, or in the corridors of Congress."
"            We are grateful recipients today of that expertise.  You know, I read Oxford University books.  Secretary Wilson writes them.  Here's the title of one, and for those of you who don't think Marines can use multi-syllable words, I'm going to prove you wrong.  Title:  ""International Law and the Use of Force by National Liberation Movements.""  How's that for a mouthful?  And how's that for a book that we might all want to be reading right now?"
"            Madam Secretary, I say unequivocally, I need your ideas and this department needs your wisdom.  The Air Force is beginning another chapter in its legendary story.  Secretary Wilson and her airmen will be in -- will have the --  pen.  She masters her subject.  She does not dabble in it.  "
"            And writing that history along-side her will be more than a half-million airmen and -women that with ""Fingers"" Goldfein on her wing, the finest Air Force in the world, if we can keep it.  If they wonder what manner of leader they welcome today, I offer the words of a student at South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, where Secretary Wilson served several years as president.  And here is the quote:  ""She was much more than a president to us.  She was a role model, a friend to us all, and above all, an inspiration."""
"So ladies and gentlemen, our Air Force welcomes a secretary, a scholar, a statesman, an advocate, and one of its own.  It is not surprising that Heather Wilson's service comes at yet another of history's hinges.  Since 1945, American air superiority has never been questioned.  Our Air Force has been so successful that America today takes for granted that our spacious skies are also safe, free and clear.  This is true around the world as America's ground and other combat forces operate with confidence that no evil can set upon them from above."
"            But history is not pre-determined, nor is it static.  History hangs on a hinge.  Air supremacy is not America's ordained right and there are other hands pushing on history's door.  They push also in space and in cyberspace.  By Secretary Wilson's leadership, by the superior service of America's airmen and -women, they push in vain.  "
"I close with a reflection.  The United States Air Force has an air force today because a pair of bicycle mechanic brothers studied flight day and night and worked like the dickens in a garage in Ohio 100 years ago.  That kind of industry and creativity, the relentless pursuit of knowledge happens all across the world today.  It must happen here.  At an astounding pace, it must happen here."
"            The U.S. Air Force must be better at it than anyone else.  And under Secretary Wilson, I have absolute total confidence that will be the case."
"            So summoned once more into service, she will, as we say in the west, she will ride for the brand -- integrity first, service before self, and excellence in all we do."
"            Secretary Wilson, welcome to the Pentagon. (Applause.)"
"            STAFF:  With Secretary Wilson's family, please join her on the steps for the oath of office."
            SEC. MATTIS:  Repeat after me.
"            I, state your full name..."
"            SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE HEATHER WILSON: I, Heather Wilson..."
            SEC. MATTIS:  ... do solemnly swear...
            MS. WILSON:  ... do solemnly swear...
            SEC. MATTIS:  ... that I will support and defend...

            MS. WILSON:  ... discharge the duties...
            SEC. MATTIS:  ... of the office on which I'm about to enter.
            MS. WILSON:  ... of the office on which I'm about to enter.
            SEC. MATTIS:  So help me God.
            MS. WILSON:  So help me God.
"            SEC. MATTIS:  Congratulations, Madam Secretary. (Applause.)"
"            STAFF:  Ladies and gentlemen, the Honorable Heather Wilson, Secretary of the Air Force. (Applause.)"
"            MS. WILSON:  Thank you, Secretary Mattis, for your leadership and also for your kindness."
"            I also wanted to thank my husband, Jay, who I think is up for sainthood, and my family, many of whom are here today from all over the country.  "
"General Goldfein, thank you.  It is true, we stood together in 1978 to take that oath the first time.  And we have a lot of other classmates here today, and most of us took our oath four years later, but I think you were on the five-year plan. (Laughter.)"
            There are several university presidents here who know students like that. (Laughter.)
"            My colleagues from -- I have several colleagues here from South Dakota, and I wanted to thank you for coming.  And Kevin Schieffer is here from the Board of Regents, as well as two of my colleagues, Tom Jackson, the president of Black Hills State, and my successor, at an exceptional engineering and science university, Jan Puszynski is here from South Dakota Mines; as well as Mike Rush and Jack Warner, who had to put up with me.  They were -- they were technically my supervisor.  I'm a very difficult person to supervise.  General Mattis -- Secretary Mattis, you should have talked to them before you hired me."
"My friends and classmates from the class of 1982, thank you for -- (Applause.) -- thank you for your friendship and for your support.  I'll need your advice, because I know you will give it frankly over the next several years."
"I also wanted to personally thank Lisa Disbrow, who has been the acting Secretary of the Air Force since January, and she is the undersecretary.  She has served the United States Air Force for 32 years.  And I could not have asked for a better -- better support and help to me and to the country. (Applause.)"
"And thank you to the airmen who protect the freedoms we enjoy.  You and your family's represent the best of what it means to be an American.  You know, in August 1908, a man names Orville Wright took a contraption made of wood and fabric just over there beyond the corner on Arlington Ridge at the parade ground at Fort Myer."
"            And he was there a man with a mission, to convince the United States Army that this contraption, this new technology would revolutionize warfare.  And he was right.  As airmen, you are the successors to those bicycle mechanics.  You are the innovators and the intrepid airmen who stand ready every hour of every day on every continent ready to protect the country that we love."
"            And we've got a lot of work to do.  Under the guidance of Secretary of Defense Mattis and with the support of the United States Congress, we will restore the readiness of the force so that we can win any fight, any time, anywhere.  We're going to cost effectively modernize the force and drive innovation to bring new capabilities to the service of liberty."
"            And underpinning it all will be a commitment to people, to the development of leaders to command the finest combat force in the world.  We're not going to take for granted American dominance in air and space power.  We're going to use every taxpayer dollar entrusted to us to train for it, to equip for it and to fight for it."
"            My classmates will remember that small book of knowledge that cadets had to memorize all those years ago.  It was called Contrails.  And every service academy graduate has a copy, usually tattered in the bottom of some box in the garage.  And there are things from it each of us likely remember.  "
"            And each of us probably have something different that we remember from that book.  But for me, one that resonates over the years is probably appropriate for this time and this place down the hill from the home of Robert E. Lee, his historic home that now is at Arlington."
"            Lee said, ""Duty then is the sublimest word in the English language.  You should do your duty in all things.  You can never do more.  You should never wish to do less.""  I know as airmen you will do your duty.  I will do my best to do my duty by all of you.  "
            God bless you all.  And God bless the country that we love. (Applause.)
"            STAFF:  Thank you, Secretary Wilson."
"            Ladies and gentleman, please join us singing the Air Force song."

"Thank you Chairman Cochran, distinguished members.  I appreciate your having me here, Chairman Dunford, and Undersecretary McCord today, and above all for steadfastly supporting DoD’s men and women – military and civilian alike – who serve and defend our country all over the world.  Over the last two weeks, I’ve visited many of those troops in the Asia-Pacific and the Middle East.  And I couldn’t be prouder of what they’re doing to advance our security and stand by our friends and allies in those critical regions."
"I’m pleased to be here with Chairman Dunford to discuss President Obama’s 2017 defense budget, which marks a major inflection point for the Department of Defense.  In this budget, we’re taking the long view.  We have to, because even as we fight today’s fights, we must also be prepared for what might come 10, 20, or 30 years down the road.  Last fall’s Bipartisan Budget Act gave us some much-needed stability after years of gridlock and turbulence, and I want to thank you and your colleagues for coming together to help pass it.  That budget deal set the size of our budget, and with this degree of certainty we focused on its shape – changing that shape in fundamental but carefully considered ways to adjust to a new strategic era, and to seize opportunities for the future."
"Let me describe the strategic assessment that drove our budget decisions.  First of all, it’s evident that America is still today the world’s foremost leader, partner, and underwriter of stability and security in every region of the world, as we’ve been since the end of World War II.  That’s thanks in large part to the unequivocal strength of the United States military.  And as we continue to fulfill this enduring role, it’s also evident that we’re entering a new strategic era.  Today’s security environment is dramatically different from the last 25 years, requiring new ways of investing and operating.  Five evolving strategic challenges – namely Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, and terrorism – are now driving DoD’s planning and budgeting as reflected in this budget."
"I want to focus first on our ongoing fight against terrorism, and especially ISIL – which we must and will deal a lasting defeat, most immediately in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, but also where it’s metastasizing.  And all the while, we’re continuing to help protect our homeland."
"Let me give you a quick snapshot of what we’re doing to pressure and destroy ISIL’s parent tumor in Iraq and Syria – beginning with Iraq, which Chairman Dunford and I both visited over the course of last week.  There, with our support, the Iraqi Security Forces retook Ramadi, have been reclaiming further ground in Anbar Province – most recently the city of Hit – and along with Iraqi Kurdish forces have begun operations to isolate and pressure Mosul, with the intent of collapsing ISIL’s control over that city."
"As we’ve made this progress, and with momentum in this campaign clearly on our side, last week in Baghdad I announced a number of key actions we’re taking to continue accelerating our campaign against ISIL.  We’ll be placing advisors with the ISF – that is, the Iraqi Security Forces – down to the brigade and battalion level, to help enhance decision-making and responsiveness.  We’ll be leveraging Apache attack helicopters to support the ISF’s ongoing efforts to envelop and then retake Mosul.  We’ll send additional HIMARS to support the Iraqi ground offensive there.  We’ll provide financial assistance to the Peshmerga, up to $415 million, to bolster one of the most effective fighting forces against ISIL.  And, to do all this, we’re going to adjust how we use our forces and also bring in about 215 more of them.  As in the past, President Obama has approved all these actions at my and the Chairman’s recommendation."
"We’re also doing more in Syria.  As the President announced earlier this week, we’re increasing U.S. forces there six-fold, from 50 to 300.  This comes after capable and motivated local forces supported by our coalition retook the east Syrian town of Shaddadi, severing the last major northern artery between Raqqa and Mosul, and therefore between ISIL in Syria and ISIL in Iraq.  These additional 250 personnel, including special operations forces, will help expand our ongoing efforts to identify, train, and equip capable, motivated local forces inside Syria to help isolate and pressure Raqqa.  They’ll also serve as a hub to incorporate partner SOF – from both longstanding traditional allies and Gulf countries – to augment our coalition’s counter-ISIL efforts there.   I should note, however, that Syria is an area where we need your help, particularly in releasing $349 million in Section 1209 funds to help train and equip our partners on the ground, as a centerpiece of our strategy there."
"All this comes on top of what we’ve already done to accelerate the military campaign – such as intensifying our air campaign based on new intelligence; introducing an expeditionary targeting force; and expanding the fight against ISIL to every domain, including cyber and space.  And as we’re accelerating our overall counter-ISIL campaign, we’re backing it up with increased funding for 2017 – requesting 50 percent more than last year.  But I have to say, much still hinges on the non-military aspects of countering ISIL, particularly efforts to address political and economic challenges in both Iraq and Syria.  That’s critical to ensuring ISIL stays defeated."
"Next, two of the other four strategic challenges reflect a return, in some ways, to great power competition.  One is in Europe, where we’re taking a strong and balanced approach to deter Russian aggression – we haven’t had to devote a significant portion of our defense investment to this possibility for a quarter-century, but now we do.  The other challenge is in the Asia-Pacific, where China is rising, which is fine, but behaving aggressively, which is not.  There, we’re continuing our rebalance to the region to maintain the stability we’ve underwritten for the past 70 years, enabling so many nations to rise and prosper in this, the single most consequential region for America’s future.  And, as I saw in India and the Philippines at the beginning of my trip, our engagement in the Asia-Pacific is deeply appreciated and in high demand – by enduring allies and new friends alike."
"Meanwhile, two other longstanding challenges pose threats in specific regions.  North Korea is one – that’s why our forces on the Korean Peninsula remain ready, as they say, to “fight tonight.”  The other is Iran, because while the nuclear accord is a good deal for preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, we must still deter Iranian aggression and counter Iran’s malign influence against our regional friends and allies – especially Israel, to which we maintain an unwavering and unbreakable commitment, and also our Gulf partners, whom I met with last week in Abu Dhabi and Riyadh."
"In this context, Russia and China are our most stressing competitors, as they’ve both developed and continue to advance military systems that seek to threaten our advantages in specific areas.  We see them in Crimea, Syria, and the South China Sea.  In some cases, they’re developing weapons and ways of war that seek to achieve their objectives rapidly, before they think we can respond.  Because of this, DoD has elevated their importance in our planning and budgeting."
"In my written testimony, I’ve detailed how our budget makes critical investments to help us better address these five evolving challenges.  We’re strengthening our deterrence posture in Europe by investing $3.4 billion for our European Reassurance Initiative – quadruple what we requested last year.  We’re prioritizing training and readiness for our ground forces, and reinvigorating the readiness and modernization of our fighter aircraft fleet.  We’re investing in innovative capabilities like the B-21 long-range strike bomber, microdrones, and the arsenal plane, as well as advanced munitions of all sorts.  In our Navy, we’re emphasizing not just increasing the number of ships, which we’re doing, but especially their lethality, with new weapons and high-end ships, and extending our commanding lead in undersea warfare – with new investments in unmanned undersea vehicles, for example, and more submarines with the versatile Virginia Payload Module that triples their strike capacity from 12 Tomahawks to 40.  And we’re doing more in cyber, electronic warfare, and space – investing in these three domains a combined total of $34 billion in 2017.  Among other things, this will help build our cyber mission force, develop next-generation electronic jammers, and prepare for the possibility of a conflict that extends into space.  In short, DoD will keep ensuring our dominance in all domains."
"That’s why we’re making increased investments in science and technology, innovating operationally, and building new bridges to the amazing American innovative system – as we always have, to stay ahead of future threats.  It’s why we’re building what I’ve called the Force of the Future – because as good as our technology is, it’s nothing compared to our people, and in the future we must continue to recruit and retain the very best talent.  Competing for good people for an all-volunteer force is a critical part of our military edge, and everyone should understand this need and my commitment to meeting it."
"And because we owe it to America’s taxpayers to spend our defense dollars as wisely and responsibly as possible, we’re also pushing for needed reforms across the DoD enterprise, and we need your help with all of them – from continuously improving acquisition, to further reducing overhead and excess infrastructure, to modernizing and simplifying TRICARE, to proposing new changes to the Goldwater-Nichols Act that defines much of our institutional organization."
"Let me close on the broader shift reflected in this budget.  The Defense Department doesn’t have the luxury of just one opponent, or the choice between current fights and future fights – we have to do both.  That’s what this budget is designed to do, and we need your help to succeed."
"I thank this committee again for supporting the Bipartisan Budget Act that set the size of our budget.  Our submission focuses on the budget’s shape, making changes that are necessary and consequential.  We hope you approve it.  I know some may be looking at the difference between what we indicated last year we would be asking for and what the budget deal gave us – a net total of about $11 billion less is provided by the Bipartisan Budget Act out of a total of almost $600 billion – but I want to reiterate that we’ve mitigated that difference, and that this budget meets our needs."
"In this context, I have serious concerns with a proposal from one of the defense committees to underfund DoD’s overseas warfighting accounts by $18 billion, and spend that money on programmatic items we did not request.  While I don’t expect this committee to consider such a proposal, I have to say that this approach is deeply troubling, and flawed for several reasons."
"It’s gambling with warfighting money at a time of war – proposing to cut off our troops’ funding in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria in the middle of the year.  It would spend money on things that are not DoD’s highest unfunded priorities across the joint force.  It buys force structure without the money to sustain it and keep it ready, effectively creating hollow force structure, and working against our efforts to restore readiness.  It doesn’t address the much bigger strategic risk DoD faces of $100 billion in looming automatic cuts; in fact, it’s a step in the direction of unraveling the Bipartisan Budget Act, which provided critical stability that DoD needs now and desires for the future.  And it’s another road to nowhere, with uncertain chances of ever becoming law, and a high probability of leading to more gridlock and another continuing resolution – exactly the kind of terrible distraction we’ve seen for years, that undercuts stable planning and efficient use of taxpayer dollars, dispirits troops and their families, baffles friends, and emboldens foes.  I cannot support such maneuvers as Secretary of Defense."
"The fact is, DoD’s greatest strategic risk is losing the stability we got from the budget deal this year, and having uncertainty and sequester return in future years.  That’s why going forward, the biggest budget priority for us strategically is Congress averting the return of sequestration – to prevent that $100 billion in automatic cuts – so we can maintain stability and sustain all these critical investments over time."
"We’ve seen this done before, and that same support, coming together, is essential today – to address the security challenges we face, and to seize the opportunities within our grasp.  As long as we work together to do so, I know our national security will be on the right path, and America’s military will continue to defend our country and help make a better world for generations to come."
"Today, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter met with the Republic of Korea's President Park Geun-hye and Minister of National Defense Han Min-koo in Washington, D.C. The Secretary greeted President Park with a full military honors parade, the first of the Secretary's tenure. "
"In his meetings with President Park and Minister Han, Secretary Carter reaffirmed the strength of the U.S.-ROK alliance as the linchpin of peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and across the Asia-Pacific and strongly reassured both leaders of the United States' ironclad commitment to the defense of the ROK. "
"The leaders discussed areas of mutual concern in the Asia-Pacific, including the challenges posed by North Korea, and the importance of continued alliance cooperation and coordination to deter and, if necessary, defend against and defeat North Korean threats. Secretary Carter and Minister Han agreed to establish an interagency working group to enhance cooperation on defense technology issues and discussed opportunities to increase alliance cooperation on space and cyberspace."
Pentagon Press Secretary Peter Cook released the following statement:
"Today Secretary of Defense Ash Carter met with Israeli Minister of Defense Moshe Ya'alon at the National Defense University in Washington, D.C. During their meeting, the secretary reaffirmed his commitment to the U.S.-Israeli defense relationship and shared his perspective on current regional security matters including Syria and Iran. Secretary Carter and Minister Ya'alon discussed ways to further several of the initiatives discussed during Secretary Carter's visit to Israel in July, including steps to deepen regional defense cooperation and further enhance Israel's security. They ended the day with a dinner at the Pentagon."
"Tomorrow Secretary Carter is scheduled to host Minister Ya'alon at U.S. Cyber Command to discuss expanding cyber cooperation between the two countries. The secretary and minister also plan to travel to Naval Air Station Patuxent River to highlight the U.S. commitment to Israel's Qualitative Military Edge. They will receive an operational demonstration of the F-35 aircraft and some of its technology. Israel will receive its first F-35 in 2016, becoming the only nation in the region with a fifth generation stealth fighter."
"Good evening, everyone, and thank you so much for being here this evening.  And thanks for that kind introduction, Bob, and thanks for inviting me to be here at the start of what looks like a very exciting evening.  "
"We have some very good friends here tonight from the department, few finer than our former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, my sidekick – I don’t know where he is – General Marty Dempsey.  Marty, his wife, Deanie – a great friend to myself, and also my wife, Stephanie, who’s here – all lovers of the great force that is ours.  It’s great to see both of you, great to see all of you.  I don’t know whether Pete Chiarelli here – Pete, if you’re here – General Pete Chiarelli, and many, many others, thank you.  Thanks for being here.  Thanks for your support to our people.  "
"Our host, Bob Woodruff – thanks for saying that.  Bob, it means a lot to us.  He’s an excellent reporter of course, and he’s right, the last time he interviewed me, we were a long way from midtown Manhattan – almost as far as you can get, in fact – on the aircraft carrier the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt in the South China Sea.  And that kind of trip is the proof that Bob Woodward will go the extra mile, or thousands of miles, in fact, to write a good story and explain about what we do, and the importance of what we do, to our world.  That’s not a surprise to any of – any of us – I think, who are here in this room.  He goes where the story is, and he’s committed to getting to get it right.  "
"Same thing from Martha Raddatz, by the way, whom I see here tonight.  I just left her in Erbil, about 10 days ago or something.  Martha, thank you also."
"For Bob – in addition to his journalism – Bob and his wife Lee have gone the extra mile for our servicemembers, for our veterans, and their families.  For the last decade, Bob, Lee, and the Woodruff family have stood up – building awareness, raising resources, and making connections for those who stand up for all of us, sometimes in harm’s way.  And for all that, I want to thank you, Bob, Lee, and everyone at the foundation, all of the supporters here, everyone here tonight.  Bless you for that.  We appreciate your standing up for our people.  And I’m going to talk a little bit tonight about how – what we’re doing to stand up for them, too.  "
"As I’m sure Bob and Lee can attest, each and every one of them, each soldier, sailor, airman, Marine, and veteran, is dedicated, driven, and awesomely capable.  And together, they have made America’s the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  We should all take pride in them, be thankful for them.  Quite simply, they do one of the noblest things a person can do, which is to help defend our magnificent country, and make a better world for our children."
"To do so today, our current force is confronting on our behalf – as we’re here tonight – no fewer than five unique, evolving challenges.  They’re countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe.  They’re managing historic change in the Asia-Pacific, the single most consequential region of the world for America’s future.  They’re strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s continued nuclear and missile provocations.  They’re checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Gulf, and helping defend our friends and allies in the Middle East.  And they’re accelerating the certain defeat of ISIL – destroying it in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, and destroying it in Afghanistan, Libya, and everywhere else the ISIL cancer metastasizes around the world, even as they continue to help protect our homeland and our people as well.  "
"Moreover, when you look at history, you see we have an almost perfect record of failure, when it comes to predicting the strategic future.  And because of that, we’re being flexible, and they’re being flexible, agile, to contend with a complex and uncertain future, where new challenges will almost certainly arise we don’t foresee today."
"And now in the Defense Department, we don’t have the luxury of choosing among these five challenges – we have to do it all.  And we confront these challenges with the strength of our technology, the strength of our values, with our penchant for innovation.  But the key –  the key – is our people.  To meet those challenges and face that unknown future, DoD counts on and takes care of our force of today, and at the same time, builds what I call the Force of the Future.  "
"Let me tell you a little bit about what we’re doing, let me start with today.  "
"As Secretary of Defense, my first commitment – and this is something Stephanie and I think about every morning when we begin our day – my first commitment is to our men and women, uniformed and civilian, to their excellence and to their welfare, to making sure they’re treated with dignity and respect, and above all, making certain that when they’re sent into harm’s way, it’s done with the utmost care and strategic necessity.  "
"I’m doing everything I can to support the strength and the readiness of today’s fighting force – investing in the right training, the right force size, the right compensation and benefits that our troops and their families and DoD civilians deserve, and the right equipment.  Just to mention that last one, for example, we need to spare no effort and expense and brook no delay when it comes to deploying – for our troops that are in harm’s way – the tools to accomplish their mission and protect themselves, whether with mine-resistant, ambush-protected, or MRAP, vehicles that help keep them safe from roadside bombs, or with new lightweight and easy to use combat application tourniquet, that stems bleeding on the battlefield, has saved countless lives, and is a big advance over its predecessor.  All this, and some ideas that our scientists are working on right now."
"But of course, our support to today’s force goes well beyond that.  It includes a commitment to help care for our military’s wounded, ill, and injured, and support our military families because they serve, too.  It includes our enduring pledge to support the families of the fallen whose loved ones made the ultimate sacrifice.  It also includes our pledge to help our servicemembers transition when they move on to whatever’s next for them in life.  And I’m very gratified to see the way employers’ attitudes towards veterans have improved in the course of my lifetime.  And it also means that when our servicemembers are not being treated fairly and with respect, we act quickly to fix it, as we’re doing with the California National Guard bonus issue.  "
"Our commitment to today’s – our commitment to today’s force also includes ensuring the respect and dignity of our people, one for the other, which is why we’ve been prioritizing the prevention and elimination of sexual harassment and sexual assault. "
"So with all this, even as our force of today is outstanding and meeting the challenges we face, the Pentagon must also – as I like to say – think outside our five-sided-box about the future, about how we stay the best tomorrow.  "
"More than anything else, we have the finest fighting force the world has ever known because of our people, and we can’t take that for granted.  As generations change, as technologies change, as labor markets change, we need to stay competitive and to continue to attract and retain the most talented young people that America has to offer.  That’s why we’re taking steps to build what I call the Force of the Future – one that will be just as excellent as the one I have the privilege to lead today.  "
"We’ve announced a number of what I call links to that Force of the Future, and I want to say something about a few of them.  "
"The first, which I announced a year ago this month, created on-ramps and off-ramps, so more people outside DoD can come inside and contribute to our mission, even if only for a time or a project – for example, in cyber – and also in the other direction, so more people in our military can spend some time outside at a leading company or university to gain skills and perspective they can bring back in to make us better.  "
"Link two, focused on improving retention among our ranks, principally by increasing our support to military families.  It’s often said that our military recruits a servicemember, but retains a family.  So with changes like 12 weeks of paid maternity leave for those serving in uniform, increased paternity leave as well, extended childcare hours on bases, we’re making it easier and more desirable for our best people and their families to stay with us."
"A third link to the Force of the Future improved our military talent management policy to ensure we’re promoting, retaining, and bringing in the best possible officers.  This is about making some common sense adjustments to our strong and successful traditions.  For example, we can’t have an officer promotion system that inadvertently passes over a Rhodes Scholar – which almost happened recently – just because he spent two years at Oxford, and as a consequence hadn’t yet held some of the Army jobs that the others in his cohort had held.  Now fortunately, Army Chief of Staff General Mark Milley, himself a scholar-soldier, intervened.  So we’re infusing more flexibility into the system and continuing to ensure that promotion is based as much as possible on all relevant kinds of merit and talent.  "
"And link number four focused on the talent management of the more than 700,000 DoD civilians.  And you may not know as much about them, but they do things like fix our planes, build our warships, staff our laboratories, and more.  Here, we made changes that make it easier to hire civilians directly – for example, before their senior year in college is over – without the long waits that make it impossible for us to be their first choice, and also to expand scholarship-for-service programs in science and technology fields."
"And today, earlier today here in New York at City College, I announced links five and six.  Link five, we’re going to tell our story in more places, more ways, and to a broader range of audiences across the country, even as we improve our recruiting efforts to widen our geographic, demographic, and generational access to young Americans – recognizing that 40 percent of our recruits come from just six states, and recognizing that fewer young people today have parents, or teachers, or coaches, or guidance counselors who served.  So these steps will help us to fish in more ponds, new ponds, wider ponds so we always have the best that America has to offer.  And last, we’re making some improvements in the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program, or ROTC – which celebrates, by the way, this year, including at CCNY, its 100th anniversary, and which furnishes 40 percent of our officers."
"In addition to all these links from today to the Force of the Future, we’ve also opened up all combat positions to women, and lifted DoD’s ban on transgender servicemembers, so that we can now have a full opportunity to draw on 100 percent of America’s population for our all-volunteer force – focusing purely on an individual’s willingness and ability to meet our standards and contribute to our mission."
"Because we’re doing all of those, because we’re taking care of today’s force and also because we’re building the Force of the Future, and because of our nation’s enduring strengths, I’m confident – confident – that we’ll meet those five challenges and fully realize the bright and opportunity-rich future for our country.  "
"But I never forget, we can never forget – you don’t forget, or you wouldn’t be here tonight – what makes it all happen.  And you know the answer, because you chose to stand up for them tonight and every day.  And that’s our people.  "
"Each of our servicemembers and DoD civilians makes me incredibly proud.  There are almost 3 million of them serving across this country and around the clock, in every time zone on earth, in every domain – in the air, ashore, afloat, and even in cyberspace – all in service of this great nation."
"All of them are defending not only the United States and its people; they’re also defending the values and the principles that define us, while they provide the security that will enable our children to live a better life.  "
"Because they do so, we can gather here this evening and enjoy tonight’s concert.  We can go to work tomorrow or study at schools like City College, where I was earlier today.  We can live our lives and dream our dreams and enjoy the freedoms upon which this country was built, and for which so many generations of Americans have fought.  "
"They make all that possible.  And at a time when not as many serve, I want them all to know that we don’t take them for granted.  Stephanie and I begin every day thinking of them.  "
"I know that our mission is demanding and constantly changing.  But I couldn’t be prouder of them for what they do every day and for what they’ve done for us.  Their excellence is unparalleled.  Their service, valued.  Their sacrifices never will be forgotten.  "
"But thank you for recognizing and standing up for them.  Thank you for all you’re doing for them.  God bless them, and God bless this great country.  Enjoy the evening."
Pentagon Press Secretary Peter Cook provided the following readout:
Secretary of Defense Ash Carter met with Ukrainian Minister of Defense Stepan Poltorak for a bilateral meeting at the UN Peacekeeping Defense Ministerial today in London.
"The two leaders discussed the fragile ceasefire between the Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces. Secretary Carter emphasized that the United States, together with our allies, remains committed to the full implementation of the Minsk Agreements in support of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders."
"As a demonstration of continued U.S. support for Ukraine, Secretary Carter and Minister Poltorak co-signed a bilateral partner concept, a document that provides a framework for the United States and Ukraine to enhance the defense capacity of Ukraine's forces, advance critical Ukrainian defense reforms, improve resource management processes,  and boost defense technology cooperation. This partner concept will build on the strong partnership between the U.S. and Ukraine and will enhance the effectiveness of U.S. security assistance efforts. Since 2014, the United States has committed more than $600 million in security assistance to Ukraine, including training programs to enhance Ukraine's internal defense capabilities, equipment to support the operational needs of Ukraine's security forces, and a robust advisory effort to advance the implementation of key defense reforms."
"Secretary Carter also urged Minister Poltorak to remain committed to the ambitious Ukrainian program of comprehensive defense reforms to make Ukraine's defense enterprise more effective and efficient. In response to a Ukrainian request, Secretary Carter today named Gen. John Abizaid (Ret.), former CENTCOM commander, as a senior defense advisor to Ukraine. Gen. Abizaid will provide authoritative advice to Minister Poltorak and other senior Ukrainian officials as Ukraine aims to implement reforms designed to bring its armed forces in line with Western principles and standards, such as enhancing democratic civilian control of the military, transitioning to a NATO-interoperable staff structure, and combatting corruption."
"Good morning, everyone and thank you for being here. I would just tell you some things are duty, some things are fun, and this one is fun. It is a pleasure to be presenting today this portrait as we remember a lifetime of service."
"Secretary Perry – our old boss, for both of us at one point – for the extraordinary effort you made to come here, and I realize you have to fly back halfway around the world when you leave here. Thanks so much. Ambassador Sir Kim Darroch, for all the ambassadors who are here, thank you for coming and reminding us of the connection between our diplomats and our military. Mr. McDonough – can you believe this. It would have caused you great fear, I think, a few short months ago, you know… but thank you so much for being here old friend. Director Clapper, so many of you who are here, Senator Lugar, Congresswoman Harmon, Congressman McKeon, Mr. Adams – where are you, sir? Waive your hand please… Thank you for doing the work that we celebrate here today. You’re a great artist."
"Over two hundred luminaries are either here or want to be here, and have sent their acknowledgment in writing… public servants, patriots, Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and friends…"
"And I would just tell you, Mr. Secretary, Ash, welcome back and welcome home, for you know this building intimately, to say the least. Over a period of 35 years, here’s a man who served both parties and, count them, 11 secretaries of defense altogether. We’re touched by the unselfish performance of this leader."
"We honor your service today, Ash, as our secretary, but we keep in mind how you placed your country’s security first, long before destiny tapped you on the shoulder to be our secretary. And destiny did not find you lacking except, perhaps, at age 11 when, I’m told you told your first boss something that caused you to be fired from your first job for “wise-mouthing,” which would not surprise any of us who have been in high council with him. But I would say you were a promising young man and, even then, willing to speak truth to power."
"You join a long line of academics-turned-guardians of our democracy, in the company of such titans as Paul Nitze and Dr. William Perry. Each of them in their own unique ways served the same end: to frustrate America’s adversaries and defend our experiment in democracy. You did the same thing, Ash, and we cannot be surprised, because you were the son of a World War Two veteran. The defense of this country was put in your DNA. You’re a native of the “city of brotherly love,” and if they win the Super Bowl, we will see it demonstrated in very unusual ways… "
"This is a Philly lad who double-majored in physics and medieval history at Yale, which is the third oldest university in the United States. Then he earned a Rhodes scholarship to study theoretical physics at Oxford, which is the oldest university in the English-speaking world, and eventually returning to his native soil with his doctorate in theoretical physics."
"He then taught that fairly straightforward discipline to other underachievers at no less distinguished a place than Harvard, which is the oldest institution of higher education in the United States. There are a lot of elderly things in your resume, sir… "
"But it’s the measure of the man that, having mastered the most rigorous of sciences, Ash Carter placed his razor-sharp mind at the service of his country, beginning the process of becoming the scholar-statesman we honor here today."
"I first met Ash in 1994, when I was Secretary Perry’s Executive Secretary. Those privileged to serve in the Department of Defense then will recall an international environment nearly unrecognizable from today’s: the Soviet Union’s breakup left nuclear-tipped missiles in silos across former USSR countries, and I had a front row seat to Secretary Perry and his acolyte, Ash Carter, orchestrating the destruction of the old Soviet ICBM silos, plowed over to make room for sunflowers or fields of wheat."
"That didn’t happen by accident, and it’s good to recall those days, because it came through congressional leadership embodied by Senators Nunn and Lugar. Yet their legislation required someone in the executive branch to turn legislative vision into reality – that’s how our system works and is structured – it takes all of us, working together. Congress legislates; the executive branch executes, and execute Ash did. Secretary Perry turned to him to make things happen, and it’s largely due to Ash that those weapons are not in arsenals today."
"Mr. Secretary, we and countless others across the continent – and other continents – are eternally grateful to you for the largely unheralded part you played, and that you continue to play, on the defense policy and science boards."
"Yet, your foresight would not permit you to rest on those laurels. We still recall that your country’s security needs meant that you would be called again to serve as undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics. And you applied yourself to those new challenges to support America’s warriors in now a new and radically changed age. Few were surprised when you assumed the role of deputy secretary of defense. "
"Yet as profound as your service proved in your decades of service, you were next but a few weeks at Stanford enjoying a more leisurely pace when the President and destiny tapped you again on the shoulder to return to the colors. I still recall you and I standing there on the sunlit campus as we bid farewell to one another, little knowing that one day we would shake hands again in Washington, DC.  You were on your way back to the Pentagon, and I began praying for you immediately…"
"So it was once more into the fray with you. This time you would be our secretary, a job for which fate or providence had well-prepared you. You came into office facing a grave challenge in the Middle East, as a barbarian caliphate sought to impose its brutality and butchery upon millions. Under your leadership, America’s military summoned the strength to answer this challenge."
"At the same time, your tenure was marked by a time of new approaches in technology, space and cyberspace, and I know Dr. Perry, you smiled sir, as Ash made his mark in each of those areas – and as our old boss, we know that you were with us all the way…"
"Rest assured this department still bears the indelible imprint of Ash and Dr. Perry’s legacy – that counterproliferation is a priority – and in Silicon Valley where you established DIUx, which was one of my first destinations when I entered this role, and it will live on, and it will prosper."
"As our National Defense Strategy emphasizes today, America must “expand the competitive space,” and you had identified Silicon Valley as one of America’s reservoirs of strength."
"In cyberspace – one area that we will do that, for we must not be dominant and at same time irrelevant… We will expand the competitive space there, and the same goes for every competitive domain of warfare – doors that you opened that I will continue to walk through. And your impact has directly benefited me as a result, so I want to say thank you publicly, in front of people who know that I’m not giving false praise here that you did this."
"Now, we will hang your portrait in the secretary of defense corridor of the Pentagon’s E-ring, where I walk out every night and watch the eyeballs follow me in each of those portraits, and I say ‘give me a break, I’m working on it…’"
"And all those who come through this magnificent building, with all of the displays which really celebrate the humanity of those who since 1775 have fought for this experiment… Everyone’s going to look at your photo and realize, once again, that when times are at their worst, America can still put forth committed public servants at their best."
"It’s a reminder that, no matter how tough the times, our free society will always provide the leaders necessary to defend the blessings of liberty in their time and for the future generations whom we owe the same freedoms you and I enjoy today."
"Secretary Carter, you were one of those who carried this leadership mantle. Thank you for your leadership in a time of peril."
"And I would like to read a few words from Secretary Panetta, who regrettably could not be here and asked that I recognize his respect for you publicly. He gave me a rather long letter, but he wants to say “thank you for supporting me during my tenure as director of the CIA and, in particular, as my deputy when I was secretary of defense. You have been an impeccable example of how important it is to link moral and emotional intelligence to the formulation of public policy, and how leadership at the highest levels demands a reasonable and civil tone, a suspicion of ideas untested by experience, and the exercise of power, disciplined by integrity.”"
"I think our former secretary sums it up very well. So Mr. Secretary, if you would join me at the portrait…"
"Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being here, and look at those magnificent servicemembers standing so proud. Thank you."
"Listen, before I begin, I need to share with you, in case you weren't aware that it's been a tough day for us in Afghanistan.  Two of our servicemembers were killed, along with four others wounded, in an operation alongside our Afghan partners in Kunduz Province.  The Afghans also suffered casualties.  We’re still learning all the details, but I hope you’ll join me in expressing our deepest condolences to the family, loved ones, friends and teammates of those affected by this tragedy. All of them are in our thoughts and prayers.  And we’re going to honor their sacrifice by remaining firm in our resolve to complete our mission in Afghanistan."
"Over 40 years ago, a young high school student in Washington, D.C. got a summer job working at the Navy Department’s Naval Sea Systems Command.  Now, for those who may not be old enough to remember – I am – that was a different time for our military. I remember it all too well. This was the last years of Vietnam, our armed forces were facing many challenges.  It was also the start of a technological revolution that transformed how we live, how we work, and how we fight.  And just to show you, a summer intern in those days in Washington, D.C. worked the punch card machine, because that was how computers worked back then."
"Now, four decades later, our technology, our military, and that young man have come a long way. You can see that remarkable progress in how our military operates and where we operate from space to cyberspace.  You can see it in how this command, the United States Strategic Command, supports every DoD mission in every region and in every domain.  And you can also see that progress in the leader we honor today, Admiral Cecil Haney – once that key punch operator – and now a combatant commander, and long an inspiration to our men and women in uniform."
"Chairman Dunford, STRATCOM team, Congressman Ashford, Congressman Fortenberry, Mayor Rita [Sanders], friends, family, it’s an honor to be with you today as we pass this critical command from Admiral Haney to General John Hyten, two of our military’s most accomplished leaders."
"I’d like to especially welcome Admiral Haney's family – his wife, whom he affectionately calls “Ms. Bonny,” daughter Elizabeth. Although Cecil may be the warrior in the family, we know Bonny is the real fighter.  Bonny, we owe you a tremendous debt of gratitude for your service and your sacrifice over the years. I know you're looking forward to spending more time with your husband and all of us in the DoD family, including me and my wife Stephanie, wish you and your family the very best."
"And to the men and women of STRATCOM, each and every one of you, all of you are doing one of the noblest things a person can do, which is to help defend our magnificent country and to make a better life and a better world for our children."
"In the heart of our nation, you perform a mission at the center of everything we do as a Department.  You underpin our nuclear deterrence.  You enable precision-guided munitions and navigation, space capabilities, and experiment with new warfighting strategies in emerging domains to prepare us for whatever the future may bring."
"Through it all, each of you is critical at a time when our military is addressing five major, unique, and rapidly evolving challenges.  We're countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe.  We're managing historic change in the Asia-Pacific, the single most consequential region of the world for America's future.  We're strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea's continued nuclear and missile provocations.  We're checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Gulf, and protecting our friends and allies in the Middle East.  We're accelerating the lasting defeat of ISIL – lasting and certain defeat, destroying it and its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, and everywhere else it metastasizes around the world, even as we help protect our homeland and our people.  And we're preparing to contend, moreover, with an uncertain future, ensuring that we continue to be ready for challenges we may not even anticipate today.  "
"And all the while, of course, America's nuclear deterrence remains the bedrock of our security, which all of you ensure here at STRATCOM.  As you do so, you manage uncertainty, prepare for change, and perform your duties with the unparalleled excellence we expect of each and every one of you.  I couldn't be prouder of what you've accomplished."
And you've done all this thanks to the wisdom and leadership of Admiral Haney.
"For Cecil, of course, that summer job became a remarkable career.  Graduating from Annapolis in 1978, he joined the Navy at a time when we were still very much thinking about the Cold War and that kind of threat.  Much has changed since then, but over the years – whether he was commanding a submarine, operationalizing our rebalance to the Asia-Pacific as commander of the Pacific Fleet, or addressing global, multi-domain threats here in Nebraska – Cecil has confronted many of our most complex challenges with unwavering dedication, profound insight, and the calm, deliberative manner that the gravity of these missions require."
"Although most of Cecil's accomplishments remain classified of course, I want to highlight some that he's done to strengthen our systems, our partnerships, and our people."
"As a strategist, Admiral Haney contributed to the essential missions of today, even as he prepared STRATCOM for the missions of tomorrow – by ensuring a safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrent force, while paving the way to its future, and by collaborating with new and innovative ways with our intelligence community on space issues. "
"As an ambassador in uniform, he built bridges to our allies, to academia, to industry – recognizing as he says that there's “no stronger deterrent message than partnerships and international cooperation.”  That message is powerful, because as all of you know, the United States is an unrivaled source of innovation, in DoD and outside of DoD. And the United States also has an unrivaled network or friends and allies around the world and our potential opponents have none. That's not accidental."
"And as leader here at STRATCOM, he's been a champion for your mission, and most importantly for his people – all of you.  That was particularly important as DoD undertook and implemented the 2014 Nuclear Enterprise Reviews, which recognized that our country had for decades underinvested in its nuclear forces – and not only in its aging technologies, but also in its people.  And we're determined to correct that now, and we're just beginning to do so – more on that in a moment – and that's in part because Cecil worked tirelessly to get you, and your families, the resources you need, the opportunities to advance your career, and the climate to empower your success."
"Through all this, Admiral Haney leaves STRATCOM, DoD, and our country stronger because he planned for the future, strengthened key partnerships, and helped ensure we invested in our capabilities, our people, uniformed and civilian.  For all that, I'm confident that STRATCOM will be ready no matter what tomorrow brings.  And I'm certain the nation owes a debt of gratitude to Cecil, to Bonny, the rest of the Haney family.  Thank you all."
"Now, as we honor STRATCOM's commander this morning, I also want to talk to you about your nuclear and space missions, and emphasize how important they are...to our department, our military, and our nation."
"In September, I visited Minot Air Base in North Dakota – home of some of the ICBMs and bombers under this command – and I made clear that America's nuclear deterrence is the bedrock of our security. While this mission isn't in the headlines every day – as I see it, we're in real trouble if it ever is – it remains the highest priority of the Department of Defense.  That means it's one of STRATCOM's most important jobs – one that we count on you every day to perform with unparalleled excellence – excellence you define."
"That's because you deter large-scale nuclear attacks against the United States and our allies.  You help convince potential adversaries they can't escalate their way out of a failed conventional aggression.  You assure our allies that our extended deterrence guarantees are credible.  And if deterrence fails – though we hope it never does – you provide the President with options to achieve American and ally objectives, all to reduce the risk of nuclear weapons ever being used in the first place."
"And as you execute these missions, I and DoD's other senior leaders are making sure we sustain our deterrence by recapitalizing all three legs of our nuclear triad, so they don't age into obsolescence.  Indeed, even as we would all of course, wish to live in a world without nuclear weapons, it's also true – something that President Obama has noted many times – that we may not realize that goal in our lifetimes. And so we must continue to maintain a safe, secure and effective nuclear deterrent. "
"As I mentioned earlier, we're beginning to correct for decades of under investment in nuclear deterrence – dating back to the end of the Cold War, when the United States believed it would be safe to allow funding for the nuclear enterprise to drop, and drop it did, dramatically.  Over the last 25 years, we made only modest investments in basic sustainment and operations.  But while we didn't build anything new for 25 years and neither did our allies, others did – including Russia, North Korea, China, Pakistan, India and for a period of time, Iran.  So we can't wait any longer and we also can't operate under the mistaken assumption that our own recapitalization will stimulate others to invest – because the evidence is just the opposite – they have consistently invested in nuclear weapons during a quarter-century pause in U.S. investment."
"Our recapitalization is about sustaining deterrence in a world very different from the world of the Cold War.  From ballistic missile submarines, to ICBMs, from bombers to air launch cruise missiles we're replacing many aging nuclear weapons delivery systems because if we don't, we'll lose them which would mean losing confidence in our ability to deter – something we can never afford."
"Our necessary replacements include the long range standoff weapon, replacing nuclear air-launched cruise missiles that enable the penetration of air defenses by our air launched deterrent...exactly, precisely, just the same logic as when they were first deployed, four decades ago.  Our necessary replacements also include our Ohio Replacement Program to build the next generation of ballistic missile submarines.  Our necessary replacements also include the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent Program – in which we'll be replacing old ICBMs with new ones that will be less expensive to maintain.  And they include investments in the nuclear command-and-control, communications, and intelligence capabilities that support our nuclear enterprise. As many of you know, that includes satellites, radar systems, ground stations, command post, control nodes, communications links, and more – which are critical to assuring nuclear command and control and providing us with integrated tactical warning and attack assessment."
"And we're investing, too, in many more parts of our nuclear enterprise, as well.  We're continuing to make vital investments in the people of our nuclear force – the men and women who operate, enable, maintain and secure America's nuclear deterrent every day.  We continue to support the Department of Energy and its national laboratories that play a critical role as DoD's partners in the nuclear deterrence mission.  And we're making much-needed infrastructure and facilities repairs to ensure the maintenance and security of the DoD bases and installations that are home to the nuclear enterprise are up-to-date."
"This enterprise relies heavily on our space systems, but nuclear deterrence is far from being the only mission we have that depends on space – and let me turn to that, a second mission of STRATCOM."
"Not everyone thinks about it, but the truth is, space is woven into every aspect of our military operations today – conventional and nuclear alike.  And that's why we're making sure – and making it known – that our space capabilities are as resilient and assured as our nuclear capabilities."
"While in the past we may have been able to view space as a virtual sanctuary, DoD must now prepare for competition there and seek to prevent conflict from extending into space.  Thanks in part to Admiral Haney's leadership, and the hard work of STRATCOM personnel, we're doing just that – working closely with our partners in the intelligence community and with our allies."
"Indeed, as space becomes increasingly congested and contested and competitive, it makes STRATCOM's work to deter and defend against attacks in space all the more important.  That's why we're continuing to make serious investments in capabilities that enhance our ability to identify, attribute, and negate threatening actions by others in space.  Our new investments aim to foil these efforts – whether an adversary aims to blind our reconnaissance satellites with lasers, disrupt our satellite communications with jammers, or use kinetic means like a co-orbital attack or a direct ascent missile to destroy the space capabilities that support our forces."
"Now, some have suggested we should treat space as something separate – either organizationally or managerially or operationally – but doing so would be a mistake.  Because every one of our missions in every domain – air, land, sea, and cyber – and also our potential opponents, rely on space in some way.  Because of that, we must integrate, and not separate, everything we have and do in space."
"All of you, the men and women of STRATCOM, are ensuring that we leverage and integrate the advantages we enjoy in space for the great benefit of all our combatant commanders and forces on the ground and in the air and in the sea.  STRATCOM is helping us write a playbook for future space operators to follow by incorporating space into our operations and our contingency planning.  Indeed, as we've been updating each of our core contingency plans at DoD, we've made sure they account for how we must now view space as a potential warfighting domain."
"To make sure we're doing so effectively, we need to experiment.  And that's where STRATCOM's Joint Interagency Combined Space Operations Center, JICSpOC, comes in."
"I created the JICSpOC last year to experiment with new concepts of integrated space operations, and so far it's been very effective – helping us identify ways to improve data-sharing, hone our ability to protect and defend critical space infrastructure, and assure command and control if they come under attack."
"And for several years now, General John Hyten has played a key role in how we've begun to treat space as a warfighting domain – he’s been a key partner of mine – from when we first saw the need for what would become JICSpOC, all the way through how we've operationalized that vision.  And that's one of the many reasons why I'm pleased that he's bringing his 35 years of experience to STRATCOM as its next commander."
"Of course, he's also bringing along his wonderful family, namely wife Laura – Hi, Laura – she’s here this morning, along with her children Katie and Chris.  And John's brother Scott, and proud parents Sherwyn and Barbara are with us, too. Thank you all for being here.  This is John and Laura's 15th move since John joined the Air Force. So, as he assumes this critical command for our country, I want to thank his family for their flexibility, for their service, and their support. Thanks, Laura and family."
"Today, John's returning to Offutt after leading our Air Force Space Command in Colorado.  There, he organized, trained, and equipped over 30,000 men and women to support STRATCOM's missions.  But just as important, he's helped shape thinking at our government's highest levels about the threats we face in space."
"And I've certainly benefited from his strategic counsel. I've known John for years.  We worked together closely when he was Air Force's Director of Space Acquisition at the Pentagon, and I was Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics.  I can't publicly describe everything we worked on together, but I can say with great confidence that throughout his career – whether serving in space operations, acquisition roles, and all the other things he's done – John has developed a keen understanding of the current and future operational needs of our DoD space force and how to acquire the capabilities we need.  His experience and expertise will be a tremendous asset to STRATCOM as we prepare and face future threats in all domains. "
"And John also has a keen appreciation for what's at stake across the entire strategic landscape for which I will depend on him, as will the President.  When he's in D.C., he's been known to road trip up to Gettysburg to study that 150-year-old-battle.  And recognizing the lush hills of Gettysburg couldn't be more different from the endless vacuum of space, a kinetic conflict in space could exact an even higher toll than that bloody battle, and leave behind a legacy that would last far longer."
"John's determined not to let that happen.  And whether it's by building interagency partnerships through JICSpOC, training our men and women to face new challenges, John's helped build a more resilient national security space enterprise that will also help strengthen our nuclear deterrence.  That's important work he'll continue here at STRATCOM, because there's more to be done to confront those 21st century threats – we have to continuously adapt, innovate, stay flexible.  With his demonstrated leadership, expertise, managerial acumen, and strategic vision, John will be a strong leader of this command for years to come – ensuring it meets not only the challenges we face today, but also those we'll confront in the future."
I'll close by emphasizing again that we really have come a long way – both as a military and country – from that summer over 40 years ago when Cecil worked that punch card machine.
"Today, ours is the finest fighting force the world has ever known. There's no other military that's stronger, more capable, more experienced, or more innovative in every domain. That's why our military edge is second-to-none.  And it's a fact every American ought to be proud of. "
"That edge, and all that progress, is the result of each of our leaders, each of our officers, each of our enlisted service members, and each of you – every soldier, sailor, airman, Marine, and DoD civilian – being dedicated to leaving their unit, their command, their office, and their mission a whole lot better, stronger, and more advanced than when they got there. It's an iterative process, one we all contribute to...one I'm very proud of."
"That's exactly what Admiral Haney did here at STRATCOM, left his mission a whole lot stronger.  Cecil, we're grateful for your tremendous contributions to our safety, to our strategy, and our deterrence.  And most of all, we're grateful for everything you and Bonny have done over the years for our people – here in Nebraska, and everywhere you've served.  As you transition from this command, you can take comfort knowing that STRATCOM is now in the hands of another proven strategic leader, who will keep pushing forward."
"In the days to come, STRATCOM's mission will continue to remain vitally important to the bedrock of our security, and General Hyten will lead this critical team with the full trust and confidence of me, Chairman Dunford, and President Obama.  And the force he inherits is ready to execute any mission required, thanks to Admiral Haney's visionary leadership."
"So to Admiral Haney and Bonny, to General Hyten and Laura, to their families, to all the men and women who have served under their strong and steady leadership: thank you for everything you've done to meet the challenges of today, to stay ahead of the threats of tomorrow, and to keep our nation safe.  May God bless you and my God bless our magnificent country.  Thank you. "
"The Republic of Korea (ROK) Ministry of National Defense (MND) and the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) held the 15th Korea-U.S. Integrated Defense Dialogue (KIDD) April 23-24, 2019 in Washington, D.C."
The ROK Deputy Minister for National Defense Policy Chung Sukhwan and Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (PDASD) for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs David Helvey led their respective delegations.  Key ROK and U.S. defense and foreign affairs officials also participated.
"During the KIDD, the ROK and the U.S. delegations reaffirmed their shared goal of achieving the complete denuclearization of, and lasting peace on, the Korean Peninsula and pledged that our combined forces will remain ready and postured to defend the ROK while continuing to support diplomatic efforts.  Both sides also shared an understanding on the importance of enforcing UNSCRs until North Korea comes into compliance with its international obligations regarding denuclearization. "
The two sides assessed that the implementation of the Comprehensive Military Agreement (CMA) contributed to the easing of tension and confidence-building on the Korean Peninsula. The two sides also committed to continue consultations and cooperation at all stages of the implementation process of the CMA while firmly maintaining the ROK-U.S. combined defense posture. 
The two sides reviewed the significant strides made to implement the Conditions-based OPCON Transition Plan and pledged to expedite the fulfillment of conditions required for the transition of wartime OPCON to the Future Combined Forces Command.  The ROK and the United States concurred that bolstering the ROK military’s defense capabilities is important for expediting the fulfillment of conditions.  
"Both sides recognized the importance of the ROK forces’ acquisition of critical military capabilities and committed to continue joint assessments through meetings of the special Permanent Military Committee (sPMC) to ensure a successful outcome.  Both sides also committed to continue deepening cooperation in various fields, to include defense industrial cooperation, science and technology, cyber, and space."
The two sides pledged to actively engage in projects such as developing strategic documents and executing an Initial Operational Capability (IOC) certification exercise in order to guarantee a stable foundation upon which the conditions-based wartime OPCON transition may take place.
"Both sides agreed that the U.S.-ROK Alliance remains the linchpin of peace and security in Northeast Asia as well as the Korean Peninsula.  Both sides assessed that the 15th KIDD reaffirmed the close bonds of the Alliance, bolstered bilateral coordination toward the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and strengthened U.S.-ROK combined defense posture.  The U.S. DoD and the ROK MND will hold the 16th KIDD in Seoul, Republic of Korea, at a mutually appropriate time in the second half of 2019."
"Thank you.  Please sit down, guys.  Please sit down.  Great to be with you.  Look at what a fabulous, what a magnificent-looking crowd.  Really appreciate it.  And you know, hey, thank you Colonel Brooks.  And is Colonel Conner still here?  There you are – thank you.  Thanks, both of you, for hosting me."
"It’s great to be at Minot again.  For me, by the way, I’ll just tell you this right now, I first came here – and I’m embarrassed to say this because this is probably before some of you were even born, but – in 1983.  Long time ago.  So I’ve known this place for a long time, and more on that shortly, because it is a place of central importance to our security – past, present, and long into the future."
"I want to acknowledge also – very, very appreciatively – the presence here of North Dakota’s two senators here today, Senator Hoeven and Senator Heitkamp.  Thank you.  Thanks for joining us.  Appreciate it.  I know they need to go back to Washington shortly.  I’m sorry about that, but I do appreciate that as well because they’re going to keep our government going in the meantime, and that’s an essential thing for all of us.  But thank you.  Thanks for being here.  Much appreciated."
"And although they couldn’t be here today, I want to thank all the rest of the leadership of the Department of Defense that’s been out here – the Air Force, OSD, the Joint Staff and so forth."
"And also, I want to mention, though they’re not here today, my good friends and great colleagues, the Secretary of Energy Ernie Moniz and the Deputy Secretary of Energy Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall – superb leaders of that department and essential partners of ours in the nuclear deterrence enterprise.  "
"And this week, I’m visiting a number of parts of the enterprise.  Tomorrow and Wednesday, I’ll be at Kirtland, and also at the Energy Department’s nuclear weapons laboratories at Sandia and Los Alamos.  But I wanted to start here, with the airmen of Minot’s 5th Bomb Wing and 91st Missile Wing, because of how much you, our people, matter to this mission, and how much this mission matters to our country."
"I know you’re only a few of the thousands of men and women, military and civilian, who contribute to the nuclear deterrence mission.  And while I’m saying this here to you at Minot, I want all of them to know in the nuclear enterprise – to the operators, to the enablers, to the maintainers, to the planners, to the communicators, to the security forces, the engineers and facilities personnel on DoD bases and installations; the scientists and engineers and technicians in the DoE weapons labs; and everyone else, including those in industry, who help keep our nuclear enterprise safe, secure, and effective – all day, every day.  We’re so grateful to all of them, all of you, for that."
"All together, you’re part of something vital, something special.  After all, there’s a lot that goes into this mission – because while deterrence may seem like a simple concept, even an elegant concept, it rests on a complicated, human-intensive and technology-intensive system."
"There are a lot of different pieces, starting with the hardware of the triad – the ICBMs, the bombers, and sea-launched ballistic missiles.  There’s also our fleet of dual-capable aircraft, those select fighter jets that extend a nuclear umbrella over our allies.  And then, just as critical, is the network of capabilities that enable nuclear command control, communications and intelligence – satellites, radar systems, ground stations, command posts, control nodes, communications links, and more.  These not only assure command and control, but also help provide us with integrated tactical warning and attack assessment."
"As you know, everyone has their role to play.  And while each physical piece is important it’s really the people who make the whole greater than the sum of the parts.  Together, all of this – all of you and all of these capabilities – comprise a system of systems that enables us to see what’s happening in the world, understand what it means, so we’re able to give the one person whom our nation has entrusted with this immense responsibility – our Commander-in-Chief, the President of the United States, President Obama – with the best possible picture of information, so that he can make the most well-informed decision possible to keep our country safe, and so that we can carry out that decision with precision, excellence, and reliability."
"And the knowledge that every part of this enterprise is working as smoothly as it should be is, what makes you effective – for it’s that which deters.  The confidence that you’re ready to respond is what stops potential adversaries from using nuclear weapons against the United States or our allies in the first place.  It’s the whole point.  So everyone playing their part is tremendously important.  It’s a mission that demands unparalleled excellence – excellence that you define.  "
"We count on you for that:  America’s nuclear deterrence is the bedrock of our security, and the highest priority mission of the Department of Defense.  Because while it’s a remarkable achievement that in the more than seven decades since 1945, nuclear weapons have not again been used in war, that’s not something we can ever take for granted.  And that’s why today, I want to talk to you about how we’re innovating and investing to sustain that bedrock."
"I realize it feels at times that most people don’t often think about your mission – which I know can be frustrating, even though in a way it’s a good thing, because it means you’re doing your job.  It’s a paradox that’s not easily reconciled, but one that I see and I understand.  Because whether they recognize it or not, our entire country, and more depends on you – since we’ve never found a perfect defense against nuclear weapons, only you can truly deter nuclear attacks that would result in enormous devastation.  "
"That’s one reason why you, and your mission, are never far from my mind – and you never have been, because I’ve been involved in nuclear deterrence issues for over 35 years.  In fact, I was telling the senators on the way out there what I just told you – 1983, first time I came here.  In fact, one of my first defense-related jobs was working on basing options for the MX missile – the one that became the Peacekeeper, and upon which the MK-12A sat – the same missile, that is, whose reentry system now sits atop the Minuteman III here."
"Today, you and your mission matter on so many levels."
"At a strategic level, of course, you deter large-scale nuclear attack against the United States and our allies.  You help convince potential adversaries that they can’t escalate their way out of a failed conventional aggression.  You assure allies that our extended deterrence guarantees are credible – enabling many of them to forgo developing nuclear weapons themselves, despite the tough strategic environment they find themselves in and the technological ease with which they could develop nuclear weapons.  And if deterrence fails, you provide the President with options to achieve U.S. and allied objectives – a responsibility that I know President Obama takes with the utmost seriousness, as do you – all to reduce the risk of nuclear weapons ever being used in the first place."
"And in a broader operational level and a more day-to-day basis, you enable American soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines to accomplish their conventional missions around the world.  As you know, they’re standing with our NATO allies and standing up to Russia’s aggression in Europe, managing change in the vital Asia-Pacific region, deterring North Korea’s provocations, countering Iran’s malign activities in the Middle East, and helping accelerate ISIL’s certain and lasting defeat.  As they do, you give them confidence that a nuclear attack against our homeland is being deterred – confidence drawn in part from the vigilance you display every day."
"And for all Americans, and for that matter, all people all over the world, the bedrock of security you provide has enabled millions and millions to get up in the morning, to go to school, to go to work, to live their lives, to dream their dreams, and to give their children a better future."
"I know you’re all aware of how important this mission is.  And your leaders in Washington know it, too – not only me, but also the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, the Secretary of the Air Force, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, President Obama – you are all on all of our minds."
"That’s important, because in today’s security environment – one that’s dramatically different from the last generation, and certainly the generation before that – we face a nuclear landscape that continues to pose challenges, and that continues to evolve – in some ways less predictably than during the Cold War – even though many around the world, and even some in the United States, are stuck in the Cold War in their thinking."
"One way the nuclear landscape has changed:  we didn’t build new types of nuclear weapons or delivery systems for the last 25 years, but others did.  At the same time, in another part of the landscape, our allies in Asia, the Middle East, and NATO did not.  And so we must continue to sustain our deterrence."
"Now, Russia has long been a nuclear power, but Moscow’s recent saber-rattling and building of new nuclear weapons systems raises serious questions about its leader’s commitment to strategic stability, their regard for long-established abhorrence of using nuclear weapons, and whether they respect the profound caution that Cold War-era leaders showed with respect to brandishing nuclear weapons."
"Meanwhile, North Korea’s nuclear and missile provocations underscore that a diverse and dynamic spectrum of nuclear threats still exists.  So our deterrence must be credible, and extended to our allies in the region.  It starts with the umbrella of deterrence you provide from Minot, supporting conventional forces like our air assets and our troops standing guard 24/7 on the Korean Peninsula to deter attack against our allies.  It’s also why we continue to build more robust ballistic missile defenses oriented toward the North Korean threat – deploying Ground-Based Interceptors in Alaska and California, and also agreeing with our Korean allies to deploy the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system, or THAAD, in the Republic of Korea.  And we back all of that up with the commitment that any attack on America or our allies will not only be defeated, but that any use of nuclear weapons will be met with an overwhelming and effective response."
"Russia and North Korea are just two countries – though very different ones – that stand out in this evolving nuclear landscape.  And there are others.  India, for example, has generally shown responsible behavior with its nuclear technology.  China also conducts itself professionally in the nuclear arena, despite growing its arsenal in both quality and quantity.  In Iran, their nuclear aspirations have been constrained and transparency over their activities increased by last year’s nuclear accord, which, as long as it continues to be implemented, will verifiably prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.  And the last example I’ll cite is Pakistan, where nuclear weapons are entangled in a history of tension, and while they’re not a threat to the United States directly, we work with Pakistan to ensure stability."
"It’s also important to note where there are not nuclear weapons.  That is, where successful nuclear stability, stable alliances, and non-proliferation and arms control efforts – such as President Obama’s Nuclear Security Summits and the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program that I worked on once upon a time in the 1990s – have prevented the spread of nuclear weapons, prevented dangers like loose nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union from becoming threats, and made the prospect of nuclear terrorism more remote, which is an agenda all great powers should embrace.  Because of these efforts, there are many places all around the world where nuclear weapons might have spread, but have not."
"Now, despite what has changed since the end of the Cold War, the nature of nuclear deterrence has not changed.  Even in 2016, deterrence still depends on perception – what potential adversaries see, and therefore believe, about our will and ability to act.  This means that as their perceptions shift, so must our strategy and our actions.  Indeed, how we deter cannot be static; rather, it must adapt as threats evolve, while continuing to preserve strategic stability – reinforcing nuclear restraint, rather than inviting competition or attack.  That’s important, because it illustrates how strong deterrence doesn’t lower the threshold for nuclear war – instead, it raises it."
"Today, however, it’s a sobering fact that the most likely use of nuclear weapons is not the massive ‘nuclear exchange’ of the classic Cold War-type, but rather the unwise resort to smaller but still unprecedentedly terrible attacks, for example by Russia or North Korea, to try to coerce a conventionally superior opponent to back off or abandon an ally during a crisis.  We cannot allow that to happen, which is why we’re working with our allies in both regions to innovate and operate in new ways that sustain deterrence, and continue to preserve strategic stability."
"Across the Atlantic, we’re refreshing NATO’s nuclear playbook – to better integrate conventional and nuclear deterrence, to ensure we plan and train like we’d fight, and to deter Russia from thinking it can benefit from nuclear use in a conflict with NATO – from trying to “escalate to de-escalate,” as some there call it.  Now, obviously, we do not seek such a conflict to begin with; rather, we seek to prevent one.  And by having our dual-capable aircraft, B-61 bombs, and air-launched cruise missiles postured as credible response options – options intended to deter – we make limited use of nuclear weapons by others less likely."
"Meanwhile, across the Pacific, we engage in formal deterrence dialogues with our allies in Japan and the Republic of Korea, to ensure we’re poised to address nuclear deterrence challenges in Asia.  And you should know that the work you do and the capabilities you provide are a common topic in these conversations, because they play a critical role in deterring a nuclear attack on these allies.  That’s also why our three countries together held a trilateral ballistic missile warning exercise this past June – to continue sustaining deterrence."
"And here in the United States, we’re sustaining deterrence by taking steps to ensure that all three legs of our nuclear triad do not age into obsolescence.  This is part of our government’s policy, which President Obama made clear in Prague in 2009 when he said that, and I quote, “as long as these weapons exist, the United States will maintain a safe, secure, and effective arsenal to deter any adversary, and guarantee that defense to our allies.”  That commitment was reiterated when the President released his 2010 Nuclear Posture Review, when he issued his 2013 Nuclear Employment Guidance, and it’s been reflected in every one of the defense budgets that the President has submitted to Congress over the last seven-and-a-half years – including his latest budget, for fiscal year 2017, which we announced in January – February."
"In this respect we’re now beginning the process of correcting decades of underinvestment in nuclear deterrence – and I do mean decades, because it dates back to the end of the Cold War, when funding for the nuclear enterprise dropped dramatically.  Over the last 25 years since then, we only made modest investments in basic sustainment and operations.  And it turned out that wasn’t enough, because ,as we now know too well, it meant that we had to rely unreasonably on talented people like you – and around DoD and the Department of Energy, for that matter – to help keep it going as it aged.  So that’s why we’re investing now not only to sustain the triad, but also to ensure you have the resources you need, the opportunities to advance your career, and the management structure and climate to empower you for success."
"For 2017, our budget invests a total of $19 billion in the nuclear enterprise.  That’s part of $108 billion we plan to invest over the next five years to sustain and recapitalize the nuclear force and associated strategic command, control communications and intelligence systems – ranging from increased funding for manpower, equipment, vehicles, and maintenance to technological efforts that will help sustain our bomber fleet, and more."
"As you know, these investments reflect how we’re continuing to implement recommendations from the 2014 Nuclear Enterprise Reviews, which recognize that our country had underinvested in an aging force.  As a result, we’ve invested about $10 billion over the last two years to make improvements.  Here at Minot, I know that’s most recently meant a newly repaired runway, expanded childcare options, and fitness centers open 24/7.  It’s created new assignment incentive pay and special assignment duty pay for military personnel.  It’s helped increase locality pay rates for civilians.  And, importantly, it reflects how we’re taking steps to replace the helicopters that help ensure that our ICBMs are secure."
"Additionally, the President’s budget also fully funds the first stages of our plans to ensure that the capabilities required to sustain nuclear deterrence don’t become obsolete.  This includes: replacing old ICBMs with new ones that will be less expensive to maintain; keeping our strategic bombers effective in the face of more advanced air defense systems, in part by replacing our aging air-launched cruise missile with a more effective long-range standoff weapon; replacing the F-16s in our dual-capable aircraft fleet with F-35s and the B61-12 gravity bomb; and building replacements for our Ohio class ballistic missile submarines."
"There are many reasons why this is important, and for that reason I’m confident the nation will make the right investments in the coming years."
"First, if we don’t replace these systems, quite simply they will age even more, and become unsafe, unreliable, and ineffective.  The fact is, most of our nuclear weapon delivery systems have already been extended decades beyond their original expected service lives.  So it’s not a choice between replacing these platforms or keeping them; it’s really a choice between replacing them or losing them.  That would mean losing confidence in our ability to deter, which we can’t afford in today’s volatile security environment."
"Second, while these investments are usually referred to simply as nuclear “modernization,” that’s only true in the sense of sustaining deterrence.  None of these investments is intended to change the nature of deterrence or how it works; after all, no one can do that.  And not only are they not intended to stimulate competition from anyone else; we know they aren’t having that effect, because the evidence is to the contrary.  After all, as I said earlier, we didn’t build anything new for the last 25 years, but others did – including Russia, North Korea, China, India, Pakistan, and, for a period of time, Iran – while our allies around the world – in Asia, the Middle East, and NATO – did not.  And our allies are not creating new types of nuclear weapons, either; that, some nations are unfortunately doing.  So this is about maintaining deterrence in a world very different from the Cold War – as older systems become less effective, we’re making sure we continue to preserve strategic stability."
"Doing this will cost money, of course, but most people don’t realize that funding for the nuclear enterprise, even then, is a relatively small percentage of total defense funding – and even as we replace aging platforms, we don’t expect that fact to change. "
"In the end, though, this is about maintaining the bedrock of our security.  And after too many years of not investing enough, it’s an investment that we as a nation have to make, because it’s critical to sustaining nuclear deterrence in the 21st century."
"Of course, even as we invest to ensure this mission has the capabilities to succeed, we’ll also keep investing to ensure it has to people to succeed, and to make sure you succeed.  Because our deterrence isn’t credible unless we have the right people – people like you, people we know we can count on – who’re manning, equipping, operating, securing, and supporting our nuclear enterprise – and not only today, but in the future as well."
"Indeed, even as we all of course would wish to live in a world without nuclear weapons, it’s also true – something President Obama has noted many times – that we may not realize that goal within our lifetimes.  And unfortunately, given what we see in today’s security environment, it’s also likely that our children, and their children, will probably have to live in a world where nuclear weapons exist.  This means that what you do – ensuring safe, secure, and effective nuclear deterrence for as long as nuclear weapons exist in the world – will continue to be important for the defense of our nation for a long time to come.  And it means that your career fields will continue to need to attract, and retain, the most talented men and women American will have to offer in future generations – people like you.  As you know, we don’t let just anybody do this job – and our force of the future, including our nuclear force of the future, will need people as excellent as you."
"That’s why I have something very important to ask of you and your fellow servicemembers who make up the nuclear enterprise and make it work:  that you keep carrying out your mission with the excellence our nation has long been able to count on from those entrusted with these weapons – excellence that is unparalleled.  In turn, we, as your leaders, will ensure you have the support and the systems you need to do so."
"I want to close by saying that you should be proud of what you do every day for our country – and do know how proud I am of you.  Because you’re doing one of the noblest things that a person can do with their life, which is to help defend our country and make a better world for our children.  And that’s what this enterprise is all about."
"When I was coming up as a physicist, the generation that trained me had worked on the Manhattan Project.  Their legacy was one of ensuring effective capabilities and credible deterrence, but never recklessness – always having immense respect for the tremendous power that nuclear weapons can unleash, and therefore having the determination to deter, so that they will never be used."
"As a young man, these were my mentors, and they helped me realize that I didn’t have to choose between strengthening nuclear deterrence or working toward a world where such deterrence would no longer be necessary – that instead, I could do both.  And ever since, even as I contributed to the advancement of weapons systems like the MX missile and other parts of our nuclear triad, I also participated in arms control efforts, non-proliferation initiatives, and helped lead the Nunn-Lugar program that secured nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union – Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus – preventing those potential dangers from becoming threats to our country, our world, and our fellow human beings."
"Today, you are the heirs to that great legacy that my generation inherited.  And it’s your task to not only uphold that legacy, but also to pass it on to those who will come after you."
"Your work here at Minot, your service, and your daily sacrifices – not to mention those of your families – are never lost on me.  And for what you do, and for the excellence and quiet professionalism with which you do it, you will forever have my, and our nation’s, profound gratitude."
Thanks again.
The Air Force is inviting vetted computer security specialists from across the U.S. and select partner nations to do their best to hack some of its key public websites.
The initiative is part of the Cyber Secure campaign sponsored by the Air Force’s Chief Information Office as a measure to further operationalize the domain and leverage talent from both within and outside the Department of Defense.
"The event expands on the DoD ‘Hack the Pentagon’ bug bounty program by broadening the participation pool from U.S. citizens to include “white hat” hackers from the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. "
"“This outside approach--drawing on the talent and expertise of our citizens and partner-nation citizens--in identifying our security vulnerabilities will help bolster our cybersecurity. We already aggressively conduct exercises and 'red team' our public facing and critical websites. But this next step throws open the doors and brings additional talent onto our cyber team,” said Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein."
White hat hacking and crowdsourced security concepts are industry standards that are used by small businesses and large corporations alike to better secure their networks against malicious attacks. Bug bounty programs offer paid bounties for all legitimate vulnerabilities reported. 
"“This is the first time the AF has opened up our networks to such a broad scrutiny,” said Air Force Chief Information Security Officer Peter Kim.  “We have malicious hackers trying to get into our systems every day. It will be nice to have friendly hackers taking a shot and, most importantly, showing us how to improve our cybersecurity and defense posture. The additional participation from our partner nations greatly widens the variety of experience available to find additional unique vulnerabilities.” "
"Kim made the announcement at a kick-off event held at the headquarters of HackerOne, the contracted security consulting firm running the contest. "
"Keen to leverage private sector talent, the Air Force partnered with DDS to launch the Air Force Digital Service team in January 2017, affording a creative solution that turns that competition for talent into a partnership."
"In fact, Acting Secretary of the Air Force Lisa S. Disbrow and Gen. Goldfein visited the Defense Digital Service and Air Force Digital Service in early April to discuss a variety of initiatives the Air Force can benefit from."
" “We're mobilizing the best talent from across the nation and among partner nations to help strengthen the Air Force's cyber defenses.  It's an exciting venture, one that will make us better, and one that focuses an incredible pool of capabilities toward keeping our Air Force sites secure,"" said Acting Secretary Disbrow.  "
"The DoD’s ‘Hack the Pentagon’ initiative was launched by the Defense Digital Service in April 2016 as the first bug bounty program employed by the federal government. More than 1,400 hackers registered to participate in the program. Nearly 200 reports were received within the first six hours of the program’s launch, and $75,000 in total bounties was paid out to participating hackers."
"Registration for the ‘Hack the Air Force’ event opens on May 15th on the HackerOne website. The contest opens on May 30th and ends on June 23rd. Military members and government civilians are not eligible for compensation, but can participate on-duty with supervisor approval."

"
	Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani, U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, and Australian Minister for Defence Kevin Andrews held trilateral defense ministerial talks in Singapore today , on the margins of the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) Shangri-La Dialogue. This was the fifth meeting of its kind among the three nations’ top defense officials."
"The defense ministers from Japan and Australia reaffirmed the strength of their respective alliances with the United States as essential to peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region, and underscored their enduring support for the U.S. rebalance to the region. In this sense, the Japanese and U.S. defense ministers confirmed close collaboration based on the new guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation and affirmed their shared intent to promote trilateral and multilateral security and defense cooperation with Australia, regional allies, and partners. Recalling Japan’s path as a peace-loving nation for the last 70 years, the U.S. secretary of defense and Australian defense minister welcomed and supported Japan’s recent efforts to play a greater role in regional and global security, including its efforts to develop legislation for peace and security under the banner of “Proactive Contribution to Peace” based on the principle of international cooperation. The U.S. also welcomed the strengthening of bilateral relations between Australia and Japan."
"
	The secretary and ministers exchanged views on the regional security situation. On North Korea, they reiterated their call for North Korea to abide by United Nations Security Council Resolutions, to engage constructively with the international community, and to take concrete steps toward its denuclearization. They underscored their shared interest in the maintenance of peace and stability; respect for international law; commitment to upholding freedom of navigation and overflight; unimpeded commerce in the East China and South China Seas. They expressed strong opposition to the use of coercion or force to alter the status quo in the East China and South China Seas unilaterally and their serious concern over Chinese land reclamation activities in the South China Sea. They urged all South China Sea claimants to exercise self-restraint, halt reclamation activities, take steps to ease tensions and refrain from provocative actions that could escalate tensions. They called on governments to clarify and pursue territorial claims and accompanying maritime rights in accordance with international law. They also called for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and China to reach early agreement on a meaningful code of conduct in the South China Sea. "
"Ensuring the value of multilateral cooperation in response to regional contingency, the defense officials confirmed that the three countries are to continue to enhance practical trilateral defense cooperation and welcomed the trilateral anti-submarine warfare exercise held in August 2014, the trilateral exercises “Michinoku ALERT 2014” in November 2014, “Cope North Guam” in February 2015, and “Southern Jackaroo” in June 2015. They also welcomed the planned participation of Japan Self-Defense Forces elements’ in the U.S.- Australia Joint Exercise “Talisman Sabre” scheduled for this July. The secretary welcomed the involvement and leadership Japan and Australia have shown in recent “Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC)” exercises that have been important to enabling this exercise's continued success and maturation to ever higher degrees of combined operations and broader participation."
"
	The officials confirmed their commitment to continued trilateral cooperation in defense capacity-building on maritime security and continued discussions on defense equipment and technology. They welcomed various opportunities for the three countries to discuss missile defense issues on a regular basis. They reaffirmed collaboration on maritime security assistance to Southeast Asia and also shared the intention to coordinate and cooperate closely in the fields of regional humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR) and maritime security together with other regional countries."
The defense officials welcomed the contribution of ASEAN-led regional security architecture to security and stability in the Asia-Pacific. They welcomed continued progress in fostering practical defense cooperation within the ASEAN Defense Ministers’ Meeting-Plus (ADMM-Plus) framework and looked forward to the conduct of the third ADMM-Plus in November 2015.
"
	The officials reaffirmed their strategic goals for trilateral cooperation and pledged to further enhance trilateral defense cooperation."
"Thank you, Chairman Dunford, for that tribute to the President and the First Lady’s commitment to our troops and their families."
"Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, Department of Defense leadership, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen – welcome, as the Department honors our Commander-in-Chief of eight critical years one last time.  This afternoon, I’d like to do so by speaking of those aspects of his service and commitment to our national defense that have been so striking and that will be so memorable, each one a constant throughout his tenure as our President:  his focused strategic leadership around the world; his steps to strengthen our force, both in its people as well as its capabilities; and his decision-making."
Secretary of Defense Ash Carter and Minister for Defence Dr. Ng Eng Hen met today in the Pentagon to sign the enhanced defense cooperation agreement (DCA) that will provide a new framework for an expanded defense relationship between the two nations. 
"During their meeting, Secretary Carter and Dr. Ng reaffirmed the excellent and long-standing bilateral defense relationship between the United States and Singapore. Dr. Ng expressed appreciation for the United States’ support for the SAF’s training detachments in the United States. Secretary Carter thanked Singapore for the logistical support that it provides to United States military aircraft and vessels in the region under the 1990 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and the 2005 Strategic Framework Agreement (SFA), which is founded on the shared belief that a strong United States presence in the Asia-Pacific is vital for peace, prosperity and stability."
"Secretary Carter and Dr. Ng also noted that it was timely for both countries to elevate defense relations through an enhanced DCA to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the 1990 MOU and the 10th anniversary of the SFA between the United States and Singapore. Under the enhanced DCA, both sides agreed on a broad framework for defense cooperation in five key areas, namely in the military, policy, strategic and technology spheres, as well as cooperation against non-conventional security challenges, such as piracy and transnational terrorism. Both sides also agreed to enhance cooperation in new areas, including humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR), cyber defense, biosecurity and public communications. Finally, the enhanced DCA also introduced new high-level dialogues between the two countries’ defense establishments."
"Secretary Carter and Dr. Ng commended the successful deployment of the second littoral combat ship (LCS), the USS Fort Worth, which was deployed to Singapore in December 2014 under the 2005 SFA. They looked forward to the third deployment in 2016, in line with the United States’ plans to deploy up to four LCS concurrently in the region by the end of 2017."
"Secretary Carter and Dr. Ng also welcomed the inaugural deployment of the P-8 Poseidon aircraft to Singapore from 7 to 14 Dec. 2015, under the ambit of the 1990 MOU and 2005 SFA. They noted that the aircraft’s deployment would promote greater interoperability with regional militaries through participation in bilateral and multilateral exercises, while providing timely support for regional HADR and maritime security efforts."
"Secretary Carter and Dr. Ng were pleased by the strong military-to-military cooperation between the SAF and the United States Armed Forces, which comprise joint exercises, personnel exchanges and cross-attendance of courses. They noted that 2015 marks the 35th year of Exercise Tiger Balm, the longest-running bilateral exercise between the Singapore and U.S. Armies, as well as the 25th year of Exercise Commando Sling, a bilateral air force exercise that has grown in scale and complexity since it was first conducted in 1990. They noted that both countries’ navies had recently commemorated the 20th year of Exercise Cooperation Afloat and Readiness Training (CARAT), an annual bilateral naval exercise. Secretary Carter and Dr. Ng noted that the interoperability built up between the militaries through these exercises had allowed both countries to work well together in joint operations, such as in previous multinational stabilisation and reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as in ongoing counter-piracy efforts in the Gulf of Aden. Secretary Carter also took the opportunity to thank Singapore for its contributions to the U.S.-led counter-Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) coalition since December 2014."
"Secretary Carter and Dr. Ng also discussed initiatives to promote regional stability in the Asia Pacific, noting the need for countries to work closely together and foster practical cooperation to counter transnational threats related to terrorism, maritime security and natural disasters.  To facilitate these efforts, Dr. Ng welcomed Secretary Carter’s maritime security initiative (MSI) through which the U.S. aims to support the development of regional maritime security capacity and capabilities."
"Secretary Carter and Dr. Ng recognised the importance of the ASEAN Defence Ministers’ Meeting Plus (ADMM-Plus) to foster practical cooperation amongst the militaries of regional countries. They also welcomed the conduct of four ADMM-Plus field training exercises (FTXs) in 2016, covering maritime security, counter-terrorism, peacekeeping operations, humanitarian mine action, HADR and military medicine. Secretary Carter and Dr. Ng also affirmed the importance of the Shangri-La Dialogue as an avenue that promotes understanding and trust between many countries in the region. Secretary Carter also welcomed Singapore’s initiative to promote better coordination of regional militaries’ HADR efforts through the establishment of the Changi Regional HADR Coordination Centre (RHCC)."
ACTING SECRETARY OF DEFENSE PATRICK SHANAHAN:  Courtney said today's the day that I should come out and talk.
(UNKNOWN):  (inaudible) Because it's a nice day.
"SEC. SHANAHAN:  Right?  Yeah, yeah.  That's right."
"Q:  Can you help us a little bit on the North Korea test?  Has the U.S. determined that anything at all was launched yesterday, even if it was something small and --"
"SEC. SHANAHAN:  I'm not going to go into the detailed intelligence.  But the way I'd characterize it is, it's not a ballistic missile."
"And then also, there's no change to our posture or to our operations."
Q:  So you are confirming that there was a test of some kind.
"SEC. SHANAHAN:  There was a test, yes."
Q:  It's just that it wasn't of significant altitude to --
SEC. SHANAHAN:  It's not a -- it's not a ballistic missile.  Okay?
"Q:  You're specifically using the word ""test,"" rather than ""launch."""
"SEC. SHANAHAN:  I mean, how -- how about “launch”?  I can use “launch.”"
"Q:  Did they actually fire something?  That's what we're all trying to figure out, or whether it was some kind of a ground test."
"SEC. SHANAHAN:  I think the way you want to look at it, it wasn't a ballistic missile, all right?"
"Q:  But they did launch something, just not that big?"
"SEC. SHANAHAN:  You could use “shoot,” “launch,” “test.”"
Q:  Test.
"SEC. SHANAHAN:  I mean, they're very synonymous terms.  "
"Q:  Well, sir, was -- it -- was it more than components?  Was it a finished piece of ordnance?"
SEC. SHANAHAN:  It was not ballistic.
Q:  Was it more than components?
SEC. SHANAHAN:  What else would you guys like to --
Q:  Was it new?
SEC. SHANAHAN:  (inaudible)
"Q:  I mean, was it some kind of a new capability or technology that shows any kind of new progress or concerns, or -- that you can share?"
SEC. SHANAHAN:  No change to our operation or posture.
"And I'm not being, you know, cagey here.  It's just that what's important is, it wasn't ballistic."
Q:  And -- and did it -- did it --
SEC. SHANAHAN:  Jeffrey?
"Q:  Does the Defense Department have the ability to counter the reach of the GRU [Eds: (sic) G.U. is the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, formerly known as GRU], as shown in the Mueller report?  Are you better than the GRU?"
SEC. SHANAHAN:  I haven't read it. Can you tell me more about what was in the Mueller report?
"Q:  They broke -- broke into personal computers, government computers, corporate computers, and (inaudible) to disseminate a lot of information seemingly at will.  Is this something that concerns the Defense Department, at just how capable the Russians are at cyber warfare?"
"SEC. SHANAHAN:  I'd need to look at the specifics of the report. We're -- you know, the Russians present a risk.  I mean, my job is to manage the risk.  We have tremendous capability at Cyber Command and the NSA."
Q:  Can we ask you a question about the Albanians?  So -- from the Voice of America.
SEC. SHANAHAN:  Hi.  Welcome.
"Q:  Mr. Secretary, what do you expect --"
SEC. SHANAHAN:  Are we -- are we okay on time (inaudible)?
Q:  -- from Albania in terms of military collaboration?  Would we expect more from Albania?
SEC. SHANAHAN:  Yes.
"Q:  I know that you have a base there, a new one."
SEC. SHANAHAN:  Right.
Q:  NATO.
"SEC. SHANAHAN:  Mostly, our conversation today will be about the contributions Albania's making and where we can best place those resources, and how to participate with the U.S.  We'll also talk about the important capabilities that the Albanians must develop."
"So part of the minister's visit here was to New Jersey to look at partnering with the National Guard, and this is with respect to helicopter maintenance.  But we'll talk more about what's the right U.S. participation."
Q:  Did you make your progress yesterday in your discussions with the Turks?
"SEC. SHANAHAN:  I did, yeah."
"Look, Minister Akar -- they are a strategic partner, right?  There will always be challenges to navigate, and that's why we took the time, since he was in town, to sit down together and I like seeing him.  This was one of those, you know, meetings, where there were no notes.  It's like, ""Okay, where are we stuck?  How do we get unstuck?""  And I mentioned this.  We stay focused on interests, not positions?  Okay."
SEC. SHANAHAN:  I told him I'd be happy to come visit him when we deliver the Joint Strike Fighter.
"STAFF:  OK, so good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  Thank you for joining us.  Today, Under Secretary of Defense Ellen Lord and Mr. Andy Winternitz, deputy assistant secretary of defense for Europe and NATO are here on the record to discuss Turkey's future participation in the F-35 program and continued military-to-military relations.  Ms. Lord has an opening statement, and then we'll go into questions.  We do have a hard stop at 1:30, so please be respectful with your questions so everyone, if possible, will have a chance."
UNDER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ELLEN M. LORD:  Good afternoon.  Thank you for attending today.
"The unit -- the United States greatly values the U.S.-Turkey dialogue and our strategic partnership.  However, the United States was disappointed to learn that Turkey sent personnel to Russia for training on the S-400 system.  The S-400 is incompatible with the F-35.  As we have very clearly communicated at all levels, Turkey will not receive the F-35 if Turkey takes delivery of the S-400 system.  Thus, we need to begin unwinding Turkey's participation in the F-35 program."
"None of the steps we are taking are irreversible.  If Turkey chooses to forgo delivery of the S-400, we look forward to restoring normal program activity.  Consistent with our strong desire to manage the unwinding of Turkey's participation in an orderly, respectful and deliberate manner, we have charted a path that will allow sufficient time for Turkish personnel associated with the F-35 program to be reassigned and depart the United States by July 31, 2019."
"To facilitate an orderly cessation of Turkish participation in the programmatic management activities of the F-35 program, Turkey will not participate in the annual F-35 Chief Executive Officer Roundtable on June 12th, and planned updates to the program's governing documents will proceed without Turkey's participation.  If the United States and Turkey cannot reach a mutually-agreeable resolution to this issue by July 31, all Turkish F-35 students and instructor pilots currently in the United States will be required to depart the country."
"The United States will move forward with a plan to update to the production, sustainment and follow-on development memorandum of understanding with all partners except Turkey.  Cooperative project personnel at the F-35 Joint Program Office will be reassigned no later than July 31.  At this point, all invitational travel orders will be canceled, and Turkish Air Force personnel will be prohibited from entering JPO facilities."
"The U.S. will continue to suspend indefinitely F-35 material deliveries and activities.  No new training will begin.  Turkey will receive no new workshare in the F-35 program.  Its current workshare will be transitioned to alternate sources as they are qualified and come to rate production.  This deliberate, measured approach, intended to allow our Turkish counterparts to adjust to this transition, will be greatly accelerated if Turkey accepts delivery of the S-400 prior to July 31."
"Our F-35 international partnership is strong and resilient.  I most recently met with our partners in April to discuss the challenges Turkey's acquisition of the S-400 presents to our F-35 air system, and we have been working in earnest for the last six months to develop and implement changes to our supply base to accommodate the potential for Turkish suspension from the program.  Cessation of Turkish participation in F-35 training activities will have no impact on the larger F-35 partnership."
"These actions are intended to mediate risks posed by the S-400 to the F-35, and are separate from any congressionally-mandated, Russia-related sanctions under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, or CAATSA.  There is strong bipartisan U.S. congressional determination to see CAATSA sanctions imposed on Turkey if Turkey acquires the S-400."
"U.S. and Turkish defense officials, from the level of the acting secretary on down, continue to engage on this issue.  The United States has sent technical items -- I'm sorry, technical teams to Turkey and hosted counterparts here to discuss the threat posed by the S-400; our mutual participation in the F-35 program, and the U.S. Patriot offer."
"The United States has been in active negotiations with Turkey over the sale of the Patriot Air and Missile Defense Systems since 2009 to satisfy its legitimate air defense needs.  Should Turkey agreed to suspend its S-400 acquisition, the United States is willing to partner with Turkey immediately to study ways to enhance Turkish security and address allied concerns with Turkey's S-400 purchase.  We seek only to protect the long-term security of the F-35 program and the capabilities of the NATO alliance, including Turkey."
"Let me reiterate: Turkey still has the option to change course.  If Turkey does not accept delivery of the S-400, we will enable Turkey to return to normal F-35 program activities.  Turkey is a close NATO ally and our military-to-military relationship is strong.  We have a commitment to ensure the safety of our NATO ally and support missions benefiting regional security and stability, including current counterterrorism operations in the region."
"STAFF:  Sir, did you have anything that you'd like to say?"
"ACTING DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ANDREW WINTERNITZ:  Well, I think I'll just -- I'll just start off and -- and say something very brief before, you know, we go into Q&A.  But obviously, the United States greatly values the U.S.-Turkey relationship.  It's a strategic relationship.  They are our ally, and our relationship is multi-layered.  We're doing a lot of things with Turkey across the -- the entire spectrum of our -- of our security relationship, and -- and that's -- and that will not end at all.  That won't be influenced, we hope, by what's going on right now with the S-400 and the F-35."
"For example, we will continue doing bilateral, multilateral exercises.  There is one coming up called Anatolian Eagle, which Turkey is hosting later this month, a multilateral exercise on interoperability and readiness, and we'll continue to participate in that."
"And so, you know, this is -- the department's actions here on this issue regarding the F-35 are based on the risks that the S-400 presence in Turkey would have, and -- and that's sort of where we are on this.  So I think I'll leave it at that for now, and (inaudible)"
"STAFF:  OK, thank you very much, sir."
Phil?
"Q:  So I just wanted to ask, you know, the -- the Turkish president has been very clear that he is going to -- he's not going to back away from this acquisition of the S-400.  But what do any (inaudible) keep opening the door for Turkey and saying they had an opportunity to change course -- do you have any reason to be optimistic?  And is this move today just meant to show that the -- that the U.S. isn't -- isn't bluffing here?  Or what is the purpose?  Because the -- the threat -- and the conservatives have made, you know, over and over and over again."
"MS. LORD:  Mmm hmm. This discussion today is part of an ongoing dialogue we've been having at many different levels.  Secretary Shanahan and Minister Akar have had an ongoing dialogue including two meetings here in the building in the last couple of months.  And we just want to be very clear on what our position is, and make sure that the Turks understand that we are here to support them in air defense, but that the S-400 is incompatible with the F-35."
"MR. WINTERNITZ:  I'd just add to that, that when -- when Turkey started training on the S-400 in Russia, that was a -- that was a signal that we needed to -- to take action as well and show that we were serious, and where our position is regarding the fact that the S-400 and the F-35 are not going to operate together."
Q:  And which countries -- I'm sorry.
"STAFF:  No, go ahead."
Q:  Which countries are going to take up the supply that Turkey is not going to be (inaudible)?
"MS. LORD:  Right now, the U.S. has handled finding second sources, and they're predominantly U.S. sources.  That's not to say we won't continue to do what we always do with good program management and look for other sources, because we would like to have second, third sources for most of the items."
STAFF:  Colin?
Q:  Hi.
"You say that NATO and Turkey remain close.  But Turkey has taken action after action, on the S-400, on the Kurds, on a range of other issues that seem to indicate that they do not share that view.  Are you trying to, sort of, isolate the F-35 issue from the rest of NATO issues?"
"What are the longer-term strategic implications if they do buy the S-400?  It would seem to establish a major new relationship with the Russians, a qualitatively and quantitative difference."
MS. LORD:  I'm only addressing the F-35 and we're keeping that separate and distinct.
Andrew?
"MR. WINTERNITZ:  Yeah.  I'll take -- you know, I have a response to you on this."
"I think in our discussions, you know, with the acting secretary and at all levels below, our counterparts really want to continue our -- really strategic partnership and our cooperation at NATO."
"And so this is -- this is -- we hope this is an aberration.  We do believe that this purchase is actually incompatible with commitments that Turkey made at NATO, especially at the 2016 -- the summit declaration from 2016, which called for spinning down, you know, equipment from Russia and not any new purchases as well."
"So, you know, this is Turkey's choice and we'll -- we'll adjust."
Q:  Is my characterization fair if they do buy the S-400?
"MR. WINTERNITZ:  I'm sorry, which characterization ..."
Q:  There is a quantitative and qualitative change in the relationship.
"MR. WINTERNITZ:  I would say it -- it changes our relationship, but I don't know if it's something -- it's not something that we hope is going to disturb the -- the many-layered strategic relationship that we have, strategic partnership that we have with Turkey across a number of issues."
STAFF:  Lita?
Q:  Is there -- does the U.S. reimburse Turkey for the four F-35s that have already been purchased?
"And has there been any indication in any of the meetings with any of the Turkish government leaders, that they are willing to make any changes to their decision on the S-400?  Everything they've said publicly suggests no.  Have you heard anything from them within these meetings that suggests a change of decision is even remotely possible?"
"MS. LORD:  For the first part of the question, we are under discussions right now here internally as to how we are going to deal with the four aircraft that they've already taken delivery on and that are at Luke Air Force Base right now."
"I think the fact that Minister Akar continues to come and meet with us, continues to have phone calls with us, continues to send letters back and forth shows that there's a desire to find a way forward."
Q:  There was a suggestion not that long ago from Turkey that they seem to indicate the U.S. was willing to sit down or talk to them about this -- this technological team that would show that the S-400 wouldn't interfere with the F-35.  Are you closing the door to that type of discussion?
MS. LORD:  We have been very consistent all along that we are not going to discuss technical mitigations to the S-400.
Q:  Tara Copp with McClatchy.
"To follow-up on Phil's question, the parts that Turkey had been producing, could you describe those parts and maybe what vendors -- or maybe what U.S. vendors are picking up the slack?"
"MS. LORD:  There were 930 -- or there are 937 parts produced by Turkish industries.  Over -- a little over 400 of them were sole-sourced.  That's what we are particularly focused on.  And we are working with Northrop -- I'm sorry -- with Lockheed Martin on the aircraft side, with Pratt & Whitney on the engine side, to find alternate sources.  They are the ones making the decisions to do that.  We are well underway but it has not been finalized, and we can share with -- that with you if we get closer to that alternative."
"Q:  Could you, by chance, just provide a few examples of the parts that are having to be … ?"
"MS. LORD:  They're -- a lot of the land -- the landing gear -- a large portion of that, center fuselage."
"Q:  Yeah.  I just wanted to ask about the impacts on the program.  I think Vice Admiral Winter suggested that about 50 to 75 aircraft could be delayed over a two-year period.  Is that still the assessment, or what's, kind of, the impact of this one?"
"MS. LORD:  What we are doing is working to do a very disciplined and graceful wind-down.  If we can work to our timelines with the Turks, we would have no major disruptions and very few delays."
"What Vice Admiral Winter was alluding to is, if we had to terminate supply, you know, early this summer."
STAFF:  (Off mic)?
Q:  (Off mic) Could I -- sorry.  
"Q:  Oh, I’m sorry …"
Do you feel confident that President Trump is onboard with your decision?  He has a habit of getting on the phone with Erdogan and changing his mind.
MS. LORD:  We continue to work very closely with NSC and State and all of government.  So there are very open lines of communication.
Q:  So what's the status of the engine depot in Turkey?  Is that going to move to Holland or are other plans for it?
"MS. LORD:  We stopped shipping materials to stand up that MRO&U facility, and there are two European MRO&Us that can absorb the volume with no issue whatsoever."
Q:  And there's -- there's no plans right now to do anything with the nuclear weapons that are in Turkey?
MS. LORD:  I can't address that.
MR. WINTERNITZ:  I'm not going to address that.
STAFF:  Valerie?
Q:  So for -- you mentioned that the current work share is going to be transitioned to other vendors.  Are they going to be allowed to finish out their contracts or is that also being cut at July 31st?
MS. LORD:  What we are doing is talking about a wind-down in early 2020.
"Q:  OK.  And just a larger-picture question: At this point, you know, Turkey's had a very large, you know, view into the technical information of the build of this jet, and their pilots also are almost all the way through training so they have a view into technical information.  How do you guys make sure that all of that stays safe?"
"MS. LORD:  Well, we control what is downloaded from our computers.  We have shared what's appropriate.  The Turks have no critical documentation that we are concerned about."
Q:  What about what's in the pilot's heads?
"MR. WINTERNITZ:  Well, I -- I would just make -- you know, Turkey's a -- a NATO ally, a strong NATO ally and -- and we have information-sharing agreements with them, and we expect that they'll continue to uphold their end of those agreements."
STAFF:  Oriana?
Q:  Is the U.S. prepared for Turkey to respond and take its own action by potentially spending U.S. operations in Incirlik Air Base?
"MR. WINTERNITZ:  I -- I don't think that -- I think that's a hypothetical, and I don't think I'm going to go down that road."
STAFF:  Tom?
"Q:  I want to follow up real quick, and then questions on Valerie's point about the wind-down.  So the parts that are made by Turkish outfits will continue until some point into 2020.  Am I understanding correctly?"
MS. LORD:  That's what we would like to see happen.
"Q:  See happen, OK."
"MS. LORD:  We want to have a process that is not disruptive to the program and allows the Turks to wind down their activities, as well."
"Q:  Thanks.  My question is, in all the discussions with the Turks over the S-400s and their needs, their anti-missile defense needs, have the Turks ever identified or suggested who they feel the threat is likely to come from?  I ask this because NATO is designed, of course, to combat the Soviet Union and Russia.  And so to -- to me, it's -- it seems a little puzzling that the -- the logical threat to them would come from Russia or an ally of Russia, yet they're relying on a Russian system.  Have you ever talked about who they thought the threat was going to come from?"
"MR. WINTERNITZ:  Well, hey, listen, Turkey's obviously in a -- in a very tough neighborhood, and so they -- I think they face threats from a -- from a number of places, and -- but they have -- they've identified this as a security need. And we have -- we are willing to discuss with them a solution that does not involve the S-400 as -- as soon as they're ready to discuss that -- you know, that with us."
STAFF:  Luis?
"Q:  Hi.  Just a very basic question.  Cause -- kind of new to all of this, so I -- I apologize.  You -- you finished your statement by saying that the F-35 is incompatible with the S-400; can you just explain what that is -- what are the concerns that you have?  What -- what does that actually mean when you say incompatible?  Aside from the basic that one is American, and the other is Russian?"
MS. LORD:  We do not want to have the F-35 in close proximity to the S-400 over a period of time because of the ability to understand the profile of the F-35 on that particular piece of equipment.
"Q:  And you're talking about the radar profile of -- of the aircraft, and -- or any potential vulnerabilities that it (inaudible) …"
STAFF:  Sylvie?
"Q:  Do you -- do you think that there is -- differences of opinion on the F-35 and the S-400 between the Turkish military and the executive?  You're thinking Turkey itself, there are differences?"
MR. WINTERNITZ:  I -- I would defer questions on that to -- to Turkey. I don't think I'm going to get into that.
"Q:  Brian Everstine of Air Force Magazine.  You had mentioned Anatolian Eagle.  So the Air Force is still planning to send six F-15s, I believe, to fly?  And in the future, would the U.S. military feel safe doing those sort of operations in a country that has the S-400 if Turkey does take delivery?"
"MR. WINTERNITZ:  You know, I think we have to evaluate what we're doing exactly there.  I think, you know, obviously, if they do set up the S-400, that is going to -- to affect how we look at those types of exercises in the future.  But for now, we're -- we're committed to -- to sustaining our strategic partnership with them, including this upcoming exercise."
"Q:  Hi, just to be clear, so July 31st is the deadline for Ankara to cancel S-400 by and accept the U.S.'s current L.O.A. on Patriot?"
"MR. WINTERNITZ:  I don't think that's exactly correct.  I think it's a little bit -- little bit different than that.  What we're saying is that we're going to start winding down the training that Turkey is doing here in the United States and their participation in the program, because they've started, you know, training on the S-400."
"And so it's not a -- it's not a deadline, in a sense.  It is -- but it is a -- a goal for us to where we will have wound it down. And also, you know, so that nothing else new is starting up."
"MS. LORD:  Yeah.  And the one caveat is, if we see further activity, we could accelerate that wind-down."
MR. WINTERNITZ:  That's right.
"Q:  And, just at this point in the negotiations, have the U.S. considered potentially handing over Patriot's technology suite, the crown jewel, so to speak, to Turkey?"
"MR. WINTERNITZ:  I mean, we -- we've discussed with them; we've made an offer on -- on what we can do.  I'm not going to get into the specifics of the offer, but obviously we will always protect our technology as best we can."
"STAFF:  Go ahead, Marcus."
"Q:  In the letter Secretary Shanahan sent to his counterpart yesterday, he talks about this possibly going beyond the F-35.  Can you talk about what else you guys are looking at, other programs you're looking at suspension of cooperation with?"
"MS. LORD:  Really, when it goes beyond the F-35, it gets into the State Department's realm and I would defer to them."
Q:  So it doesn't include any arms sales stuff; it was more of the exercise stuff that -- or cooperation?
"MS. LORD:  Well, in terms of any further actions or sanctions, that's the State Department."
Q: Yep.
STAFF:  Jenny?
"Q:  Oh, sorry, that was my question, actually.  But I didn't know if yet there are any weapons systems that could -- are also incompatible with the S-400?"
MS. LORD:  We have not addressed that.  We've addressed the F-35.
Q:  A quick question:  just looking for some more detail on this training mission that Turkish forces went to in Russia.  Do you have any more detail as far as how many Turkish troops went?  Is this the first time that they've gone over for training?  Is there any indication from Turkey that these -- these troops being trained will be now withdrawn now that the department has taken this -- this position?
"MR. WINTERNITZ:  I mean -- I mean, to your last point there, you know, that would be great, but I think what we know on this is what Turkey has shared publicly, that they've started the training in Russia."
Q:  Wow.
Q:  What -- what specifically do you need to see Turkey do to halt the winding down of -- of this participation in the F-35?
"Even if they don't take delivery next month, it doesn't mean that they couldn't take delivery in August or September.  Do you need them to, sort of, renounce and rip up the contract publicly, or -- what is it that they have to do to stop this?"
"MR. WINTERNITZ:  I think it would be great if they started winding down their acquisition of the S-400.  I mean, I think, obviously, you know, a good signal would be if they were to stop the training in Russia.  That would be a great signal to us, and then we can -- but we're willing to discuss those -- those matters with them when they're ready."
"STAFF:  One last one, and then we're going to go ahead and go (inaudible)."
Q:  Me?
STAFF:  Yep.
"Q:  Oh, cool. (Laughter.)"
Do you think that this is going to have any impact on the contract negotiations that are ongoing?
Turkey's obviously --
MS. LORD:  Which contract negotiations are you referring to?
Q:  The LREP-11 and beyond -- or sorry -- LREP-12 and beyond?
"MS. LORD:  Not -- not at all, not at all."
"Q:  OK.  And why -- why do you guys -- why aren't you guys having the pilots pause their training now, or have them go back now?  Why have them -- have so many of them complete their training?"
"MS. LORD:  We actually had a new tranche of pilots that were supposed to arrive in June not come, and what we're trying to do is be respectful with the Turks as we move along.  And we're hopeful that they will stop the acquisition of the S-400.  We'd very much like them to stay in the program, have the F-35 and not have the S-400."
"STAFF:  So we're going to go ahead and stop there.  Sir, do you have any closing remarks?  No ? Mister … ?"
MR. WINTERNITZ:  No.  No. (Laughter.)
STAFF:  Do you have anything you would like to add?
"MR. WINTERNITZ:  I don't.  I think we've basically said what we need to say.  And thank you, everybody, for -- for coming out for this."
"STAFF:  Ma'am, do you have any closing remarks?"
"MS. LORD:  I just wanted to say that this -- everything that we're talking about, in terms of winding down the program, is not an irreversible decision.  So if Turkey wants to stop procurement of the S-400, we would very much like them to continue in the F-35 program."
"Good afternoon, everyone.  And Stephanie, thanks so much for that introduction – above all, thanks for what you do here.  She’s one of my partners in this great enterprise, and as I look out here in this audience, I see so many others…DoD leaders, colleagues, and then we, of course, have our honorees, their family, and their friends: welcome.  Welcome to this which is the 36th annual Department of Defense Disability Awards Ceremony – 36th."
"It’s an honor to be with you today to recognize 18 outstanding servicemembers and civilians for their service to our department, our mission, and our nation."
"From budgets to logistics, management to intelligence and more, these men and women help defend our great country and make a better world for our children.  "
"To our honorees, you’re exceedingly valuable members of our team.  You make us smarter and stronger every day by what you do for our mission.  And you help to keep our nation and our people safe.  And what nobler mission in life can there possibly be than that?  I’m proud to have you in the DoD family, and I’m proud to call you colleagues.  Let’s give – first of all – all of our awardees a big round of applause."
"And – as Stephanie said – this afternoon, we’re also celebrating five DoD components and military departments for exemplary practices in employing individuals with disabilities.  Now, it was almost thirty years ago, in 1987, that then-Secretary Weinberger – and yes, I worked for him – made a pledge to increase the employment of individuals with significant disabilities to 2 percent across the Department of Defense.  While we still have work to do to meet that pledge, our honorees and all our components and military departments have made real progress in hiring – and making our workplaces more accessible to – those with disabilities."
"Four of the component awards today recognize programs and practices that promote the hiring, the retention, and the advancement of individuals with disabilities.  And we’ve added a new award this year to recognize achievements in ensuring accessible information and communication technology to every employee, which is obviously important in today’s digital workplace. "
"As we recognize these components and military departments, I want to commend the Air Force for “aim[ing] high,” as their motto says, and winning, for the fifth year in a row, the Achievements in Employment of Individuals with Disabilities Award for best military department – way to go, Air Force.  And I also want to acknowledge the great work by our other awardees – the Defense Finance and Accounting [Service] office, Washington Headquarters Services, the National Security Agency, and the Missile Defense Agency.  Let’s give all them a round of applause as well. "
"Now, one thing Stephanie said was true, and that is that my first priority as Secretary of Defense is to our people.  And whether it’s our men and women in uniform, civilians, we have the best people in the world, and that’s what makes ours the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  We recognize, moreover, that the thing that matters most about each person, in turn, is what they can contribute to our great and noble mission.  That’s necessary – that’s a necessary perspective of an all-volunteer force.  We have to start from a position of inclusivity, and not exclusivity because we depend on the most qualified, and we can’t rule anyone out of the pool from which we select the most qualified.  So we need a department where everyone who can serve and wants to serve has the full and equal opportunity to do so.  Anything less isn’t just plain wrong; it’s bad defense policy, and it puts our future strength at risk."
"We can’t afford that at a time when our department is addressing five rapidly evolving, evolving – I’m sorry – rapidly evolving and immediate, major, international challenges.  We’re countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe.  We’re managing historic change in the Asia-Pacific – the single region in the world of greatest consequence to America’s future.  We’re strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s continued nuclear and missile provocations.  We’re checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Gulf, and protecting our friends and allies in the Middle East.  And we’re accelerating the certain defeat of ISIL…in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, and everywhere else it metastasizes around the world, even as we protect our people here in the homeland.  And we’re preparing to contend, moreover, with an uncertain future – ensuring that we continue to be ready for challenges we may not anticipate today."
"To meet those challenges, today’s and what lies in the future, we need to keep our military edge as sharp as possible.  And our awardees today – these fine individuals and these departments and components – are doing just that.  "
They’re ensuring that any person who wants to serve – who wants to help us tackle those five challenges and help us seize the many bright opportunities before our nation – can do exactly that.
"As National Disability Employment Awareness Month begins, we’re reminded of our commitment to live the values we defend – to make the Department of Defense more open and accessible to all who can make a contribution to our mission.  So I encourage all DoD components and military departments to renew their commitment to increase the employment of individuals with disabilities."
"Together, we will make our workplaces more accessible to all.  We will meet the five challenges we face.  And we will continue to keep America safe long into the future…by harnessing the talents, the skills, and the perspectives of 100 percent of America’s population."
"Thank you, and congratulations. "
"JOHN CHIPMAN:  Ministers, members of houses of parliament, delegates, welcome to the opening plenary of the 17th IISS Shangri-La Dialogue. We have a very full program before us this morning, and so I'm delighted to be able to open at this time."
"Allow me first to thank very warmly Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi for his splendid keynote opening address last night, which was a joy to listen to, and I think his text deserves a full reading.  And I'm quite certain by now it's on the IISS website, possibly even on your telephone apps, and I think it's something that should not just be heard, but also studied in slower time."
"Let me thank also, of course, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong for graciously hosting our dinner last night, Deputy Prime Minister Teo, Minister Ong, foreign minister and other hosts of the government of Singapore for insuring that yesterday's dinner was such an excellent celebration of the spirit of the Shangri-La Dialogue and all that it represents."
"This morning's proceedings in plenary are on the record.  The prepared remarks of each of the speakers are on the record.  The answers to questions are on the record.  I'd also like to underscore the questions themselves that are on the record.  So, as you pose your questions, think, also, of your own reputations, as you make those brief remarks."
"I will ask, when we do come to questions and comment that, you take no more than about 90 seconds in making that comment or question and perhaps, if you have something particularly profound to say, stretch to a maximum of two minutes.  If I sense a speech coming on or serious momentum or building to a crescendo, I might, with the powers available to me here, turn off your microphone, so do exercise discipline."
"I will be doing so, only in the democratic interest of insuring that as many of you as possible are able to join the conversation, as we say."
"If you do want to make a brief comment or ask a question from the floor and we do want to engage as many people as possible, you need to do three things.  First, you take your name badge and tap it on the left side of the microphone unit.  And the second thing you do is touch the screen, either the left or right, depending on where you're sitting in respect to the microphone, and then press the silver button on either the left or the side -- or the right side.  And when you do that, you will be joining the queue."
"The microphone unit will turn green.  That does not mean your microphone is on.  So if you whisper something to your neighbor, you can be confident that not everybody in the hall will hear it.  I will turn on your microphone when I call you, but it is important to put your name badge on the microphone.  Press the green button.  Press the silver button.  Do those three things.  You're in the queue.  There could often be 10 or 12, 15 people in the queue, and then I'll shall call people as -- as I can."
"Our first plenary is on U.S. leadership and the challenges of Indo-Pacific security, and we're delighted, of course, for the second year running to have the Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis address us in this opening plenary."
"As all of you know, he is an advocate of strong defense.  As a soldier, he knows the brutality of war, and the effectiveness of a well trained military machine.  As a thinker, he knows that strategy is vital and its development and constant application, important.  And as a warrior, he knows the value of alliances.  He has been an expert advocate of the arts of defense diplomacy.  Understanding that engagement with political and military leaderships, internationally, is important for the United States.  Of the many aphorisms for which he's famous, one of the ones I like the most is his injunction to soldiers to engage your brain before you engage your weapon.  And so, it is with very great pleasure that I invite Jim Mattis to engage his brain with us today.  Jim Mattis, the floor is yours."
"SECRETARY OF DEFENSE JAMES N. MATTIS:  Thank you very much.  Well, thank you, John.  Good morning, excellencies and fellow ministers, military officers.  And thank you to IISS and of course to Singapore -- probably the most gracious and competent of hosts we can find anywhere in the world."
"It's an honor to come before you for the second time as the secretary of defense at the Shangri-La Dialogue which I consider the best opportunity for senior officials to meet, share perspectives, and reinforce the significance of a free and open Indo-Pacific region."
And in particular to speak to how we will work together to sustain that vision.  Last year I came here principally to listen -- I was new in office and I needed to do a lot of listening and I have visited this region six times since then and my listening has confirmed for me the high degree of commonality among the nations in this very-diverse region.
Today I come to share the Trump administration's whole-of-government Indo-Pacific strategy which espouses the shared principles that underpin a free-and-open Indo Pacific.
"For as Prime Minister Modi reflected last night, a commitment to common values must be a foundation or even the foundation upon which we build a shared destiny."
"Standing shoulder to shoulder with India, ASEAN and our treaty allies and other partners, America seeks to build an Indo-Pacific where sovereignty and territorial integrity are safeguarded --the promise of freedom fulfilled and prosperity prevails for all."
"In firm support of this vision, America's recently-released national security and national defense strategies express the Trump administration's principled realism.  They take a clear-eyed view of the strategic environment and they recognize that competition among nations not only persists in the 21st-century, in some regard it is intensifying."
"Both strategies affirm the Indo Pacific as critical for America's continued stability, security, and prosperity.  Americas Indo-Pacific strategy is a subset of our broader security strategy, codifying our principles as America continues to look West.  In it we see deepening alliances and partnerships as a priority, ASEAN's centrality remains vital, and cooperation with China is welcome wherever possible.  And while we explore new opportunities for meaningful multilateral cooperation, we will deepen our engagement with existing regional mechanisms at the same time."
"In the early years of our republic President Thomas Jefferson sought to establish America's presence in the Pacific Northwest, the part of the country where I later grew up.  President Jefferson anticipated this coastal region of America would become a gateway to the Pacific and open up vast opportunities for increased trade and commerce.  America has expanded its engagement and deepened its connectivity across the region ever since."
"So, make no mistake, America is in the Indo-Pacific to stay.  This is our priority theater, our interests, and the regions are inextricably intertwined.  Our Indo-Pacific strategy makes significant security, economic, and development investments, ones that demonstrate our commitment to allies and partners in support of our vision of a safe, secure, prosperous, and free Indo-Pacific based on shared principles with those nations, large and small."
"Ones who believe their future lies in respect for sovereignty and independence of every nation, no matter its size, and freedom for all nations wishing to transit international waters and airspace, in peaceful dispute resolution without coercion, in free, fair, and reciprocal trade and investment, and in adherence to international rules and norms that have provided this region with relative peace and growing prosperity for the last decades."
"To these principles, America is true in both word and deed.  In our economics, we seek fair competition.  We do not practice predatory economics, and we stand consistent with our principles.  The U.S. strategy recognizes no one nation can or should dominate the Indo-Pacific."
"For those who want peace and self-determination, we all have shared responsibility to work together to build our shared future.  As we look to that future, our Indo-Pacific strategy will bring to bear U.S. strengths and advantages, reinvigorating areas of underinvestment."
"This morning, I'd like to highlight several themes of our strategy.  First, expanding attention on the maritime space.  The maritime commons is a global good, and sea lanes of communication are the arteries of economic vitality for all.  Our vision is to preserve that vitality by helping our partners build up naval and law enforcement capabilities and capacities to improve monitoring and protection of maritime orders and interests."
"Second, interoperability.  We recognize that a network of allies and partners is a force multiplier for peace.  Therefore, we will ensure that our military is able to more easily integrate with others.  This applies to both hardware and software by promoting financing and sales of cutting-edge U.S. defense equipment to security partners at opening the aperture of U.S. professional military education to more Indo-Pacific military noncommissioned officers and officers."
"Through our security cooperation, we are building closer relationships between our militaries and our economies, all of which contributes to enduring trust."
"The third theme is strengthening the rule of law, civil society, and transparent governance.  This is the sunlight that exposes the malign influence that threatens to stain all economic development.  Our defense engagements reinforce this theme, whether our professional military education or combined military exercises, or the day to day interactions between our soldiers, sailers, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen and the armed forces from across the region."
"A fourth theme is the private sector-led economic development.  The United States recognizes the region's need for greater investment, including in infrastructure.  We are invigorating our development and finance institutions to enable us to be better, more responsive partners."
"U.S. agencies will work more closely with regional economic partners to provide end-to-end solutions that not only build tangible products, but also transfer experience and American know-how so growth is high value and high quality.  Not empty promises and surrender of economic sovereignty."
"The U.S. stands ready to cooperate with all nations to achieve this vision.  While a free and open Indo-Pacific is in all our interests, it will only be possible if we all pull together to uphold it.  To protect shared principles, we will continue partnering with the existing regional institutions."
"Central among these, of course, is ASEAN and the institutions it created, such as the ASEAN Regional Forum, the ASEAN Defense Ministers Meeting-Plus, and the East Asia Summit, as well as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, and trilateral and multilateral mechanisms of like-minded partners."
"A central element of our strategy is strengthening of our alliances and partnerships in terms of mutual benefit and trusted relationships.  We are committed to working by, with, and through allies and partners to address common challenges, to enhance shared capabilities, to increase defense investment where appropriate, to improve interoperability, to streamline information sharing, and to build networks of capable and like-minded partners."
"In Northeast Asia, the dynamic security environment continues to underscore the importance of our robust alliance and partner relationships.  On the Korean Peninsula, we hold the line with our ally, supporting our diplomats who lead this effort.  Our objective remains the complete, verifiable, and irreversible nuclear -- denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and the international community is in alignment here, as evidenced by multiple unanimous United Nations Security Council resolutions."
"Beyond North Korea, we are focused on modernizing our alliance with both the Republic of Korea and Japan, transforming these critical alliances to meet the challenges of the 21st century."
"The Department of Defense remains steadfastly committed to working with Taiwan to provide the defense articles and services necessary to maintain sufficient self-defense consistent with our obligation set out in our Taiwan Relations Act.  We oppose all unilateral efforts to alter the status quo, and will continue to insist any resolution of differences accord with the will of the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait."
"In Southeast Asia, we have reinvigorated our longstanding alliances with the Philippines and Thailand while bolstering our enduring partnership with Singapore.  At the same time, we are seeking to develop new partnerships with pivotal players across the region, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam, where we have made historic progress based on shared interest and mutual respect."
"We continue to support ASEAN centrality in the regional security architecture, and seek to further empower it.  The more ASEAN speaks with one voice, the better we can maintain a region free from coercion, one that lives by respect for international law."
"In Oceana, our alliances and partnerships are based not only on common security interests, but also on deeply shared values and a long history of shared sacrifice.  Australia remains one of our strongest allies, and this year we celebrate our first 100 years of (mateship ?).  We are also revitalizing our defense partnership with New Zealand, and we've modernized these key alliances and partnerships to ensure that they are as relevant to the security challenges of this century as they were to the last."
"Our strategy also recognizes the importance of the Pacific Islands, America's gateway to the Indo-Pacific, and a region where we are stepping up our engagement."
"The president's budget made good on our long-overdue promise, to fund our compact of association with Palau, and this is just a down payment on the initiatives to come in this important part of the world."
"In South Asia we are strengthening our partnerships, particularly with India.  Prime Minister Modi's remarks last evening underscored India's role as a leader and responsible steward in the Indo-Pacific region."
"The U.S. values the role India can play in regional and global security, and we view the U.S.-India relationship as a natural partnership between the world's two largest democracies, based on a convergence of strategic interests, shared values, and respect for a rule-based international order."
"Our regional cooperation is growing in a range of areas, consistent with these shared objectives.  Our partnership extends beyond the Indo-Pacific region, and we welcome India's continued significant contributions to stability reconstruction in Afghanistan."
"We're also increasing our engagement with other Pacific allies, such as the United Kingdom, France and Canada, with whom we share enduring interests in the region."
"A generation from now, we will be judged on whether we successfully integrated rising powers, while increasing economic prosperity, maintaining international cooperation, based on agreed-upon rules and norms, protecting fundamental rights of our peoples and avoiding conflict."
"Our Indo-Pacific strategy informs our relationship with China.  We are aware China will face an array of challenges and opportunities in coming years.  We are prepared to support China's choices, if they promote long-term peace and prosperity for all in this dynamic region."
"Yet China's policy in the South China Sea stands in stark contrast to the openness of our strategy.  It promotes -- what our strategy promotes, it calls into question China's broader goals.  China's militarization of artificial features in the South China Sea includes the deployment of anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missiles, electronic jammers, and more recently, the landing of bomber aircraft at Woody Island."
"Despite China's claims to the contrary, the placement of these weapons systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion.  China's militarization of the Spratlys is also in direct contradiction to President Xi's 2015 public assurances in the White House Rose Garden that they would not do this."
"For these reasons, and as initial response to China's continued militarization of the South China Sea, last week we disinvited the People's Liberation Army Navy from the 2018 Rim of the Pacific Exercise, as China's behavior is inconsistent with the principals and the purposes of the RIMPAC exercise, the world's largest Naval exercise, and exercise in which transparency and cooperation are hallmarks."
"To be clear, we do not ask any country to choose between the United States and China, because a friend does not demand you choose among them.  China should and does have a voice in shaping the international system, and all of China's neighbors have a voice in shaping China's role.  If the U.S. will continue to pursue a constructive results oriented relationship with China, cooperation whenever possible, will be the name of the game and competing vigorously where we must."
"Of course, we recognize any sustainable Indo-Pacific order, as a role for China, and at China's invitation, I will travel to Beijing soon, in our open transparent approach to broadening and deepening the national dialogue between our two Pacific nations."
"I will end as I began.  As a Pacific nation, the United States remains committed to building a shared destiny with this region.  The U.S. offers strategic partnerships, not strategic dependence.  Alongside our allies and partners, America remains committed to maintaining the region's security, its stability and its economic prosperity, a view that transcends America's political transitions, and we'll continue to enjoy Washington's strong bipartisan support."
"For as, President Trump said, in Da Nang, we will never ask our partners to surrender their sovereignty or intellectual property.  We don't dream of domination.  Working together on basis of shared principals, we can create a future that provides peace, prosperity, and security for all, a constellation of nations, each in its own bright star, satellites to none.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and I look forward to your questions."
"MR. CHIPMAN:  Many thanks, Mr. Secretary, and happily, we have a good amount of time for questions.  I've got eight or nine people on the list already.  Tap your name badge, press the green touch screen, press the silver, you'll be on my list.  The first person to catch my eye is (Josh Rogan ?) from the U.S. -- Josh?"
"Q:  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.  Thank you for your time today and for your service."
"As the Trump administration tries to strengthen our alliances and partnerships, to implement what your own national defense strategy calls, our strategic competition with China."
"The way in which the Trump administration is picking fights with allies and partners, for example, on trade but certainly not exclusively on trade, seems profoundly counterproductive.  If one of China's strategic aims is to separate the United States from its allies and partners, aren't we doing their work for them?  Thank you."
"SEC. MATTIS:  Well, first of all, I would just tell you that, when I travel the region, we find a great deal of common purpose with our partners, with our allies, even with non-traditional partners and allies, new relationships that are coming, are fresh to us, that are not ones that we enjoyed, as short as five years ago or 10 years ago."
"So in my -- the reality of what I find, as I travel, the short answer is no, we are not.  Now, there are areas where friends disagree.  There are areas where we compete in trade, but there is a underlying basis of fundamental respect for certain values, and I would just say, those values were extremely well articulated last evening by the prime minister of India and he spoke about respect for international law, that sort of thing.  There was a president that we had a few years ago that I referenced earlier -- President Thomas Jefferson.  And he made a statement that in something so complicated as the science of what he called political economy, no one axiom can be laid down as wise and expedient for all times and circumstances."
"Certainly, we have had some unusual approaches -- I'll be candid with you, some unusual approaches to how we deal with these issues.  But I'm reminded that so long has nations continue dialogues -- so long as they continue to listen to one another and to pay respect to one another, nothing is over, based on one decision, one day.  And the enduring sharing of values, the enduring respect always provides a forum for us to move a relationship forward in a positive manner.  And again, I would repeat, in a positive manner, a positive direction."
"MR. CHIPMAN:  From Indonesia, Dr. (Sylvia Yahdid ?)."
"Q:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.  When we are talking about strategic partnership in this region of course we also have to deal with gaps of capabilities.  May we know what the U.S. has -- the strategies to deal with these gaps in capabilities among nations in this region?  Thank you."
"SEC. MATTIS:  You know, as we look at this -- this issue -- it's one that we confronted inside this strategy because too often we've seen the very gap you referred to actually set us apart from allies, from partners, from those are dealing with terrorism, for example or other transnational threats.  And what you have to do when you're in our position you have to adjust everything from your training to the liaison opportunities to the education opportunities and use education and training as the primary avenues to close those gaps."
"I think that what we will see in the future as I direct a by, with, and through military strategy for the U.S. military and Indo-Pacific command, you are going to see us more capable of closing that gap from our end.  Where before we've stood back-said this is the way we do business.  Now we're going to come to you, say, how do you do business?  And here's what we've learned -- whether it be in combating terrorism or in maritime operations and share those lessons in a manner that can be embraced and then we assist you also with high-end capabilities if that's what the gap is based on and bring you forward as your sovereign decisions say this is a priority for you."
"So, we believe the gap can be closed and it really comes down to whether or not we have the political will and the military wisdom to close the gap.  We know the gap can be closed -- we all recognize that.  It's just whether or not we choose to do so.  I'm quite confident we can close the gap as we go forward.  We do not find any military out here that is somehow in a position where they cannot grow, and we cannot grow alongside them in terms of partnership.  We can overcome the gaps."
"MR. CHIPMAN:  And from India, (Sheila Baat ?)."
"Q:  Thank you.  I wanted to ask, America has changed the name of the Pacific Com recently to U.S.-Pacific Alliance.  Sir, I wanted to know, what does it signify?  What is the symbolism in it?"
"SEC. MATTIS:  Right.  With the symbolism, I've been asked about that several times last night and this morning.  The bottom line is we should be willing to adapt the name of the command to reflect more accurately its focus."
"As we've looked right now at the role of the Indian Ocean with the largest democracy in the world coming into its own with economic progress there in India, we need to recognize that there's a growing significance to the Indian Ocean, to the Indian subcontinent, and certainly to India itself.  So I want to make certain that the title actually reflects the reality.  And there's a changing reality.  The world's always changing, and that's all this was."
"Now underneath that, there are things that have been going on which show, as I referenced in my prepared remarks, that we are in fact dealing with our priority theater.  I-- I don't trumpet those things.  We've replaced, for example, third generation fighters with fifth generation fighters, we've added our most capable ships to the commander of Indo-Pacific Command's fleet during the last year or two, and we will continue to address this theater as a priority and properly defined as now the Indo-Pacific Command."
"MR. CHIPMAN:  And from China, Senior Colonel Zhao Xiaozhuo."
"Q:  Thank you.  A couple of years ago, the United States sent the Antietam missile cruiser and the -- the Higgins missile destroyer to China's territorial waters.  And the -- I think it is a violation of the law of the People's Republic of China, of territorial waters, and -- and the contiguous zone.  And also it is obvious provocation to China's national security and territorial integrity."
I think it is the militarization in the South China Sea under the veil of the freedom of navigation.  So I'd like to have your comment on this.
"SEC. MATTIS:  Yes, Colonel, I think it goes to a fundamental disconnect between the way the international tribunals have looked at these waters.  These waters, to us, are free and open international waters.  We all talk about a free and open Pacific, a free and open Asia-Pacific, a free and open Indo-Pacific.  Freedom means freedom for all nations, large and small, to transit international airspace, international waters."
"Traditionally, historically, and by the rule of law, this is not -- this is not a revisionist view.  This is a traditional view.  This is an established view, and we've had international tribunals reinforce this, independent from us, that we don't -- we don't control it, it was under (N Kloss ?), and so when we see those kind of manifestations of interpretations of international law, then we act accordingly."
"We do not do freedom of navigation for America alone.  We do freedom of navigation -- it's freedom for all nations, large and small, that need to transit those waters for their own prosperity and they have every reason to do so."
"So we do not see it as a militarization by going through what has traditionally been an international water space.  What we see it as is a reaffirmation of the rules-based order.  And we -- I -- again, I will be going to Beijing to have further discussions on this at your government's invitation here at the end of the month."
"But I understand the disagreement, but it is not one on which we are unstudied and we believe it's only appropriate that we keep those waterways open for all nations."
"MR. CHIPMAN:  And from Thailand, Dr. (Taernsac Shalaam Palunapub ?).  You may have turned off your microphone, I fear, so go ahead."
Q:  My question is...
"MR. CHIPMAN:  I'm -- I'm afraid you've turned off your microphone (chip ?), perhaps I'll just go to someone else and come back to you when someone comes to sort that out."
(Mark Champion ?) from the U.K.
"Q:  Secretary, thank you.  I think it's clear that you have established this year, last year, and for some time agreement on those principles of the -- the rules-based order, freedom of navigation, you know, among most of the allies who -- who come here.  I  -- but the -- there's an increasing question I think about whether -- not to mix metaphors, but the -- the ship has sailed."
"In other words, the military assets that were protesting against and their placement on islands that have already been built -- they're there.  They're not going to move.  And the role that China -- whatever role it is that China seeks to use them for is going to continue.  Do you think that -- that in essence, it's correct?  That that ship has sailed, and you're going to have to deal with it?"
"SEC. MATTIS:  Well, I -- I think that -- dealing with it as a reality, I think there are consequences to China ignoring the international community.  We firmly believe in the non-coercive aspects of how nations should get along with each other, that they should listen to each other."
"Nothing wrong with competition, nothing wrong with having strong positions, but when it comes down to introducing what they have done in the South China Sea, there are consequences."
"I would tell you that up until -- if you'd asked me two months ago, I'd have said we are still attempting to maintain a cooperative stance with the PRC, with China.  We (were ?) inviting them to the RIMPAC and world's largest naval exercise in order to try to keep the open lines of military communication between us and transparency."
"But when you look at what President Xi said in the Rose Garden of the White House in 2015, that they would not militarize the Spratlys, and then we watched what happened four weeks ago, it was time to say there's a consequence to this.  And the world's largest naval exercise will not have the Chinese Navy participating."
"But that's a relatively small consequence, and I believe there are much larger consequences in the future when nations lose the report of their neighbors, when they believe that piling mountainous debts on their neighbors and somehow removing the freedom of political action is the way to engage with them."
"Eventually, these things do not pay off, even if on the financial (lender sheet ?) or the power (lender sheet ?) they appear to.  It's a very shaky foundation when we believe that militarizing features are somehow going to endorse their standing in the world, and -- and enhance it.  It is not.  It's not going to be endorsed in the world.  It's not going to enhance it."
"And you have to wonder why military actions that are politically injurious would be engaged in by a nation.  What is the value to having carried out military operations?  Number one, we all know nobody is ready to invade those features.  Certainly, we could have had the dispute resolution go on in a peaceful way.  To simply muscle the way in using weapons to do what international tribunals do not endorse is not a way to make long-term collaboration the role of the road in a region that's as important to China's future and we respect that, as it is to every other nation's future out here."
"So, there are consequences that will continue to come home to roost, so to speak, with China if they do not find the way to work more collaboratively with all of the nations who have interest."
MR. CHIPMAN:  Dr. (Tamzak ?).
"Q:  Thank you, sir.  Mr. Secretary, what else can ASEAN do as far as the FOIP is concerned?  So far ASEAN as a group is only asking for more details, so in your opinion what else can ASEAN as a group do?"
"SEC. MATTIS:  Number one, we see ASEAN's centrality in effect being a way to have a forum where the nations can come together and certainly some nations are small -- they don't have big militaries.  They have smaller economies.  But they all have a voice.  They all have human beings who would deserve a future and need prospects of advantage.  This is the normal thing that nations do for their people.  It's why, frankly, we're all here at Shangri-La.  I mean we wouldn't be here if we didn't recognize our interactions with each other."
I think when you look at ASEAN it has always been a very non-contentious organization.  It looks for ways to deal with things maturely.  How do you make things win-win rather than win/lose?  How can everybody benefit?
Now when they speak with one voice there is a much stronger lesson coming out of ASEAN.  A lesson that we can all learn from.  I think too that we have to avoid -- I would just point out the -- what Prime Minister Modi called last night the impossible burdens of debt.  Certain nations can actually lose their freedom simply by taking what appears to be a hand-up when in fact it's a hand-out that makes them depended.
"So, if the ASEAN nations can help one another and support one another in a way that maintains the freedom, the sovereignty, the territorial integrity of each of the nations then that, in effect, strengthens ASEAN's voice."
"But I think it's most important that ASEAN look for unity on these fundamental values that Prime Minister Modi went into quite-good detail about last night.  And the idea that we're going to turn over this world to our children without having the same kinds of values, the same advantages that we have enjoyed as these nations came out from underneath the yoke of colonialism, I think that sets a very irresponsible position.  We're going to have to pull together and deal with it in a unified way.  ASEAN's centrality means it is fundamental to that effort."
"MR. CHIPMAN:  And from France, (Francois Borg ?)."
"Q:  Thank you.  Last year at the previous Shangri-La dialogue, in response to a question from the floor, sir, you urged America's allies quote, ""to bear with us.""  Does this recommendation still stand?"
"And on a more personal note, how are you bearing up? (Laughter.)"
SEC. MATTIS:  I hate it when someone quotes me from the year before. (Laughter.)
Q:  Never happens.
"SEC. MATTIS:  Well, sir, I would just tell you that based on my travels over the last year, I've been out in the region six times since I was last here, some for extended trips, and I -- I enjoy doing a lot of listening when I'm out and about, we continue to find more common ground than uncommon ground.  We continue to find more reason for collaboration than not."
"And remember, this is an America that if you go back several hundred years to President Jefferson, from then one, we saw this as an opportunity out in the Pacific to and with nations.  Our first Treaty of Amity was with Thailand back in the early 1800s.  For 200 years we've been here.  For 200 years we've watched the European colonial wave come through and then recede."
"We have watched fascism, imperialism, wash over the region, and at a great cost to many of us in this room and our forefathers it was pushed back and defeated by 1945.  We watched Soviet communism as it tried to push into the region, and the Cold Ware blunted stopped and rolled that back, so we have been here.  We have seen those who want to dominate the region come and watch them go, and we've stood with you."
"So this is not about one decision at this point in time.  This is not about any areas that we may find uncommon right now, and we may be dealing with in unusual ways, but the bottom line is, that we have been through thick and thin, we have stood with nations, and they all recognize today, we believe in the free, and independent and sovereign nations out here."
"And I would just tell you that we are not going to change our mind on this.  After that rather nasty argument we had with King George III, my apologies to our U.K. comrades -- (Laugher.) -- we have stood on this same principle, and it's not based on which party's in power.  It is not based on a fleeting position.  This is one we look back on with a great deal of confidence.  So also look forward to the future with confidence."
"And I'm doing just fine, thank you.  No problem. (Laughter.)"
Q:  Well done.
"MR. CHIPMAN:  And from Japan, (Hiroyuki Akita ?)"
"Q:  Thank you very much, chair. (Hiroyuki Akita ?) from (Nikkei ?) Japan."
"I have two quick questions about the North Korean crisis.  One is that the -- in late April, as I remember, you implied that status of U.S. troops in Korean Peninsula will be on negotiation table if peace talk between south and north will make progress.  And does it mean that it is also option for U.S. to withdraw or reduce U.S. military footprint in Korean Peninsula in case of the -- you know, if there was progress between South and North at peace talks?"
"And second question is that President Trump announced that there's going to be a meeting on June 12th between Mr. Trump and (inaudible) Kim Jong-Un, and he said that he doesn't want to talk about maximum pressure anymore."
"And so my question is that, is military option still on the table?  Or while you talk -- the U.S. talks with North Korea, maybe it is off the table?  Thank you."
"SEC. MATTIS:  Thank you.  Obviously, the eyes of the world, the hopes of the world are on these talks and I would just say to our Singapore hosts here today, they are also hosting these talks and we are grateful that you have been able to on such short notice with the usual to-and-fro of something as historically groundbreaking as this the way you've just taken it all in stride -- we are grateful for that -- that sort of support."
"I would tell you that any discussion about the number of U.S. troops in the Republic of Korea is subject to -- one, the Republic of Korea's invitation to have them there and the discussions between the United States and the Republic of Korea -- separate and distinct from the negotiations that are going on with DPRK.  They have -- that issue will not come up in the discussions with DPRK and as you all recognize; those troops are there as a recognition of a security challenge."
"Obviously, if the diplomats can do their work -- if we can reduce the threat.  If we can restore confidence-building measures with something verifiable, then of course these kinds of issues can come up subsequently between two sovereign democracies -- the Republic of Korea and the United States.  But that issue is not on the table here in Singapore on the 12th nor should it be."
"As far as military options, I think you're aware -- and I said this last year when I was here -- I have said it in every public forum I've been asked about this issue.  This has been a diplomatically-led issue since January 22 of last year when we came into office.  It has been diplomatically led.  It has been diplomatically reinforced at the UN Security Council with three -- just since January of last year -- three unanimous security council resolutions."
"It was diplomatically led when Canada hosted the sending nations Foreign Minister's -- these are the nations that sent crew to the Korean Peninsula in response to the United Nation's call in 1950.  Canada hosted the foreign ministers, not the defense ministers, in Vancouver British Columbia in a discussion this last January to further the diplomatic efforts to try to bring this issue to a close."
"So, we still stand for the verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the peninsula and the diplomats are engaged right now in New York.  Advanced teams are engaged here in Singapore and I think the hopes of all of us lie with them."
"MR. CHIPMAN:  And from Australia, Gordon Flake."
"Q:  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.  Over the last several months there's been a lot of discussion about the quadrilateral dialogue between the United States, Japan, Australia and India.  And so much so there's been a bit of a strawman thrown up there as evidence of the lack of robustness of the Indo-Pacific.  And yet in your remarks and in the Prime Minister's remarks last night, the quad didn't come up in specific.  I'm curious as to your assessment of the relationship between the quad itself and the Indo-Pacific strategy, as you outlined it."
"SEC. MATTIS:  Very good.  The Quad, as you characterized it accurately, is certainly one of those additional mechanisms, multilateral mechanisms that we look to.  We look to it, and look at what is the common character there, Australia, Japan and India and the United States.  All four are democracies.  That's the first thing that jumps out at you."
"So we have four democracies that are talking about how do we maintain stability?  How do we maintain open navigation?  How do we talk about basically keeping things on a peaceful dispute-resolution path?  And I think that it would -- it's absolutely an idea fit for its time, and I support it 100 percent."
"I actually had my seven-hour speech here, and that was one of the things I cut out in order to reduce it somewhat (Laughter.)"
MR. CHIPMAN:  Thank you.
"And from the United States, Senator Dan Sullivan?"
"Q:  Thank you, Mr. Secretary for an outstanding speech and your exceptional leadership.  We in the U.S. Senate also think you're doing fine, so I'm glad you think you're doing fine."
"You know, as the secretary of defense, you've also spoke very articulately about the importance of economic issues and financial issues.  And in addition to your leadership, where we are very focused on rebuilding our military, we are also back home in the United States reinvigorating very strongly our economy, hoping to be growing at 3 to 4 percent GDP growth, which we haven't seen in well over a decade, and areas like energy, where we are now once again the world's energy superpower in terms of the production of oil, production of natural gas, production of renewables."
"Can you talk to those issues and how you see them fitting in the broader Indo-Pacific strategy for the United States and how important those are, as well as military matters?"
"SEC. MATTIS:  I can, senator. One of our senators from a Pacific Ocean state, the state of Alaska, the economic -- the economy of our country has always been the economic engine that drove our national security, so restoring the economic underpinning has been essential as the administration came into -- came into office with its responsibilities."
"But we see this almost as the way we hear it explained to every time we get on an airliner, and you've all heard the speech that in the event of loss of cabin pressure your mask will drop; put your own mask on first, and then help others around you.  We see what we're doing here as a way to economically build our own enduring strength, but we do not see that, nor have we ever seen that as something selfish."
"You know what we did with the Marshall Plan after World War II. Senator Gardner also joins us here.  He has got an initiative with heavy bipartisan support in the U.S. Senate, the House of Representatives, for the Asia reassurance.  Basically how are we going to reinforce our friends, partners, allies in the Pacific?  How do we share that kind of economic vitality that we are going to have in terms of technology, in terms of military-to-military connection."
"And most importantly, how do we help the development of those nations that are still lagging behind or still coming out of difficult circumstance?"
"So this is basically our engine again today that has been ever since around 1900 that kept us an as arsenal of freedom, an arsenal of democracy, but it's also meant in the broader terms of democratic values being reinforced by -- using the economic sinews that we are now developing once again in a much more robust manner, if that addresses your question, senator."
"MR. CHIPMAN:  And from Pakistan, (Alisar Wanakfe ?)."
"Q:  Mr. Secretary, it's a pleasure to hear you speak about U.S. strategy in the Pacific region.  Mr. Secretary, I head a think-tank in Islamabad, Pakistan.  There are perceptions that different people have different things."
We feel that the United States is of course interested in peace and stability of the South Asian region but is not paying enough attention to the nuclear situation in our region.  The nuclear weapons capability of India and Pakistan on land was worrying in many ways already and now India has embarked upon the nuclearization of the Indian ocean with the (inaudible) and all other naval vessels -- submarines -- nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed.  Which is not only a cause of strategic instability between India and Pakistan also the security worry for 32 literal states that are located in the Indian-Ocean region.
"Would you like to comment, sir on this?  And I have another small question -- if I can quickly do it, Mr. Chapman."
MR. CHIPMAN:  If you can quickly do it.
"Q:  The Indian role in Afghanistan -- India is not a neighbor contiguous to Afghanistan, so I don't know how the U.S. visualizes an Indian role in Afghanistan.  Thank you."
"SEC. MATTIS:  Thank you.  Very good questions.  We've put together several strategies and one common theme in our Indo-Pacific strategy and certainly in what we called South-Asia strategy, which was the one within which we contribute to the NATO-led campaign in Afghanistan -- a theme that these are not strategies.  These are not confrontational strategies.  They are based on the idea of cooperation."
"For example, we regionalized our strategy in South Asia, so we were not looking at Afghanistan in isolation.  And obviously when you look at South Asia, then Pakistan and India were two of the nations we had to consider: their legitimate security interest; their potential role in restoring peace in an area where a war has gone on too long already."
"And so, we put these strategies together as a way to find common ground regionally, not as a way to find an exclusive club."
"So, in terms of -- now narrow that down to nonproliferation.  I believe that we have got to give as a world community -- as a global community more attention to nonproliferation.  Clearly, we do not need any more of these kinds of crises where we have looked away from the problem in DPRK for too long and now we are confronting something where the hopes of the world -- almost everyone is catching their rough as we wish well to the diplomats upon whom this burden has now dropped."
"There are ways to maintain a world with a nonproliferation as an ongoing issue, an ongoing effort by all of us, nuclear armed and not nuclear armed.  In the -- in the case of the U.S., after we came out with our National Defense Strategy, we came out with a Nuclear Posture Review, an NPR, something that, by the way, before I rolled it out, we went to a number of -- more than two dozen allies and briefed them ahead of time and took their ideas onboard.  Because these are the -- this nuclear deterrent is probably the most -- the heaviest issue that I deal with every day in this job."
"So what we want to do is if we modernize to keep the nuclear deterrent safe and effective, so those weapons are never used, we have to have a significant effort -- collaborative effort within -- of nonproliferation as we try to reduce the -- this scourge, and that's the only way you can describe nuclear weapons in this world.  So we will work on this."
"And I think in the Indian Ocean, I think you bring up a good point, it's one of the areas we as a world need to give more attention to.  How do we reduce the concerns of -- of the countries there so they don't have to resort to a larger nuclear stockpile?"
"(Inaudible) dollars of development money, and there are highways, there are schools, medical clinics.  You'll notice there are no Indian troops on the ground, as they understand there's a role for development here as they trying to stay stabilizing without aggravating the concerns of the Pakistan government -- of your country's government."
"So it's a difficult issue, but I think it's also one that India is operating in the best interest of the region and of the world as they try to help through development funds to remove the root causes of why young men pick up guns or -- or listen to the lies of the terrorists and then they get off -- once they start thinking in this direction, it is very difficult to bring them back to a civilized behavior."
"And so I like what India's doing there.  I support it.  I think we need more education and less fighting in the world, and I see India foremost in this effort in Afghanistan."
MR. CHIPMAN:  I've got about 14 people on the list.  I'm just going to take two.  Dr. Jeffrey Ordaniel from the Philippines.
"Q:  You have mentioned the South China Sea quite extensively in your speech, Mr. Secretary.  So my question is related to the U.S.-Philippine alliance.  Because in 2014, President Obama, when he was visiting Manila, was asked twice by a journalist if Philippine-occupied features and Filipino public vessels in the South China Sea are covered by the 1951 U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty.  And twice, he sidelined the question."
"When Secretary Hillary Clinton was asked the same question, she said that she does not to discuss hypothetical scenarios.  But let me just ask the same question of you, Mr. Secretary, because I think the answer to this question is very important as to how the Duterte administration is going to move ahead with its own maritime security policy."
"So in essence the question is, are Filipino public vessels and Philippine-occupied features in the South China Sea covered by the 1951 U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty?  Thank you."
"SEC. MATTIS:  Yes, thank you.  It's good to see someone without my color hair here, young man.  I appreciate that."
"The -- let me tell you that when we have discussions on these matters, the reason why public figures do not want to give specific answers is that these are complex issues.  And when you start saying, ""yes, no, black, white"" -- we have been on the record about international tribunals that say there is no such thing as a nine-dash line, or is no legal basis for this -- we stand by international law.  We stand by international tribunals.  We listen to each nation's concerns.  And to simply turn it into a -- a military or non-military response is -- is a shortchanging of the issue."
"This is what diplomacy is all about.  Diplomacy is all about taking contrary perspectives and finding common ground.  And we've got to try to do that in this world.  Those of us who have worn uniforms, those who wear uniforms today, are keenly aware of the cost of war, and there has got to be a commitment, not a, ""Well, when it suits me, I'll listen to other nations.""  Not, ""When it suits me, I'll listen to international tribunals."""
"It's go to be that we actually want to live by these rules, these rules that have allowed China to recover many people from the depths of poverty and bring up their quality of life; these rules have helped China.  There is a reason why China, I believe, will eventually come to grips with the needs and the expectations of the neighbors around them."
"And further, I would just tell you that we maintain confidentiality at times in these efforts, and I -- you know, I mean it's a free and open press here, and I -- I support that, but at the same time, you can often do most of your good work and setting the conditions for a path ahead by not locking yourself into public statements where, understandably, people take each word separately apart and now pretty soon you're -- you're locked into positions that do not allow the diplomats to find common ground."
"So I'm not trying to give a -- a civics class here, I just want you to understand why in many cases those who actually carry the responsibility do not go for, ""It's my way or the highway,"" or there's only one position.  That would -- might very well be a going in position, and we stand by our treaty allies, but this is a discussion between the current administration in the Manila and in Washington D.C., and it's not one that can be answered as simply as your question would indicate."
"MR. CHIPMAN:  And from Malaysia, Dr. (Ngao Chao Bing ?)."
"Q:  Hello.  Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary.  So the reason the National Security Strategy document and a National Defense Strategy document of the United States government have identified China and Russia as the main concerns, and basically the strategic adversaries in the coming years, I assume, is the position."
"As I understand the -- for a long time, the U.S. strategy is trying not to create -- it will have a unifier erosion (inaudible) and try to drive a wedge between China and Russia, but now the documents seem to actually push them to work together even further.  So is that really -- I'm just wondering -- is that really a wise move to put China and Russia and make them actually work much closer in these documents?  Thank you."
"SEC. MATTIS:  Yes.  If that's what the documents appear to do -- I've got to go back and read them again, because our view is that with both those nations with great power competition and at levels that we had hoped we'd see be characterized more by cooperation and collaboration -- if the competition is going to grow more strident then that's what we don't want to have happen."
And in terms of their relationship I think it's -- from my review its objective fact that Russia has more in common with Western Europe and the United States than they have in common with China.  I believe China has more in common with Pacific Ocean nations and the United States and India than they have in common with Russia.  I think there's a natural non-convergence of interest.  There may be short-term convergence in the event they want to contradict international tribunals or try muscling their way into certain circumstances but my view -- I would not be wasting my time going to Beijing at the end of the month if I really thought that's the only option between us and China.  What would be the point of it?  I've got more important things to do.
"I believe that what we're going to see is at some point in both Moscow and Beijing they are going to recognize the reality of what we see in this room: many different nations all sitting down together all trying to find a way forward with respect for each other's internal dynamics, each other's culture and not finding this as a reason why we cannot work together.  We all know we can work together."
"We have worked closely with Russia to defeat fascism and with China to defeat fascism.  We have worked closely with other nations that we had open war with: with Germany, with Japan after World War II.  There is no need for this to go in the direction you're referring to of those two against the world."
"There are obviously a lot of nations allied with us.  There's a lot of nations collaborating and partnering with us but those nations and us, combined have a desire for peace and figured out how we can find a way through these disagreements in a positive, productive, relationship that's competitive certainly but does not have to be combative and that we all have to work hard at that."
"But I will go back and read the documents again -- after you go through it about 30 times before you sign it you can sometimes start to see the forest for the trees.  So, thanks for bringing that up.  I'll take a look at it.  It's certainly not how we see the world."
"MR CHIPMAN:  In about two minutes we will move immediately to the second plenary on the important issue of de-escalating the North Korean crisis, but I hope you all agree with me that we have had just now a very clear statement from the U.S. secretary of defense.  And a tremendous conversation with the secretary of defense in command of the subject matter, the issues, the strategy, and defense diplomatic execution.  And please join me in thanking him for these 45 minutes. (Applause.)"
"All right.  Well, listen, good afternoon."
"Let me just start off by expressing my thanks to each and every one of you in this room, for I know each and every one of you is making a contribution to this critical mission.  And I thank you because wherever sexual assault occurs – whether it's on the front lines or here at home – it not only undermines our values, it undercuts our ability to execute our mission to protect our people and make a better world for our children.  Honor and trust are the lifeblood of the profession of military arms.  Every sexual assault is an attack on those values.  So, too, are acts of retaliation against those who report these crimes."
"The theme of this year's Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month is ""Know your part, do your part,"" and that's more than just a slogan.  It's one of our missions.  And let me make one thing clear, I view retaliation associated with reporting sexual assault or harassment as unacceptable conduct.  It's a direct threat to the health of our force."
"We must ensure that as a Department, we're doing everything we can to provide the proper protections and support for those who come forward to report sexual assault.  To that end, after last year's annual report on sexual assault in the military, I mandated a Department-wide retaliation strategy to improve the way we support service members who experience retaliation from reporting this crime, while aligning prevention and response efforts across the Services."
"And this was something new, and it to me reflects something that I'm proud of, which is in retaliation, we came to recognize yet another dimension of this scourge.  And we're taking it on, and that's what this step represents.  There will be more in the future as we learn more and we get better.  We've got to get better.  But I'm not proud that retaliation occurs, but I'm proud that we recognized it.  While there's much work that remains to be done to eliminate this overall scourge, sexual assault, from our military, today we're taking an important step with the release of this strategy.  And there are copies of the strategy here.  It will be posted today on the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office's website at SAPR.mil. "
"And I want to thank General Nichols, wherever she is -- General Nichols and I, I should say, go back a long ways, in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; and couldn't be -- have more confidence in your leadership on this important mission."
"The report, as you'll see, provides a framework for strengthening support for those who experience retaliation in connection with reporting sexual assault or harassment, and for clarifying the retaliation response process.  In taking these actions, we will uphold our commitment to survivors and reporters.  And I hope we will also influence those considering whether to make a report, whether to do it or not."
"We're also here today to recognize servicemembers and civilians who not only know their part and do their part, but who serve as models in their response to sexual assault across the services, at all levels of responsibility.  They've promoted an environment where sexual assault is neither tolerated nor ignored.  In different ways, they have reinforced a culture of prevention, accountability, dignity and respect.  And I'm proud of each and every one of them."
"Sergeant First Class Raquel Mendoza knew her part and went far beyond the call of duty to strengthen our force.  She created a triage decision tree that ensured anyone standing guard was trained to properly handle sexual assault when it occurred, notify the responsible parties, assist in the preservation of evidence, and protect the rights of the survivor."
"Her decision tree is so effective that it's now being replicated across the entire U.S. Army.  She also established an on-based mentorship program that affirms the dignity and experiences of survivors, raising awareness and galvanizing the Fort Carson community to do its part against sexual violence."
"Ms. Deborah Drucker helped to shift the expectations and perceived norms within the submarine community to integrate and welcome female crew members.  She also confronted the long-held stereotype that all survivors of sexual assault are female and all perpetrators are male.  She encouraged members of her community to consider male as well as female survivors, which is vital to changing environments and behaviors."
"Ms. Jacqueline Maxwell demonstrated extraordinary compassion for the survivors of sexual assault at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, and determination to improve how we teach our personnel about sexual assault.  Her efforts led to the first-ever sexual assault prevention and response proclamation of support by unit and base commanders.  From the ground up, she inspired military leaders to commit to a total team effort to prevent sexual assault."
"Captain Elizabeth Bellow made sure that our men and women across AFRICOM had an advocate and the resources they needed across 15 geographically separated operating locations supporting over 7,000 service members.  Through education, orientation or frequent outreach, she helped establish evacuation procedures to transport survivors from across the command to locations with certified providers of forensic exams."
"Sergeant First Class Melinda Heikkinen -- did I pronounce that right?  Melinda, where are you?  How did I do?  We'll have another chance in a minute when you get your reward."
"Anyway, you traveled more than 3,000 miles as a sexual assault response coordinator for the Washington Army National Guard to advocate for survivors."
"Where did she go?  She's back there -- there you are; there you are…But in all seriousness, in the process of doing that, she created a policy for victim care and response that enabled all restricted reporting cases to move to unrestricted reporting -- all.  This policy encouraged a cultural shift allowing survivors to be comfortable to report assault and receive compassionate care."
"Ms. Simone Hall is the final member of our force I'd like to recognize today.  She used cutting-edge technology to ensure that 6,500 military and civilian employees of the U.S. Coast Guard had instant access to sexual assault prevention and response services.  She is dedicated to establishing an environment within her service that promotes dignity and respect for every individual, with the ultimate goal of eliminating sexual assault."
"There they are, these six individuals, trailblazers.  They know their part.  They do their part.  And they're doing whatever it takes to fight against sexual assault in our military ranks.  They're a model for all of us in the Department. While we celebrate these six remarkable individuals, we know our work is not finished.  "
"And in that vein, I'm pleased to make one more announcement today.  The Defense Digital Service is combining forces with our Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office to launch a project that will improve the systems that underlie our reporting databases.  This is important, because this will allow for more streamlined, timely and accurate reporting.  It will also reduce the burden on our dedicated sexual assault response coordinators and investigators, a big burden I know from talking to them, allowing them to spend more time with survivors."
"This project will help the Department understand sexual assault data in a more meaningful way, also ultimately leading to more transparency between DOD advocates and others invested in this critical mission."
"So, to the six women with us today, I'm so proud of you and the work you've already done.  By choosing to defend your country and make a better world, you've dedicated your lives to one of the noblest things a person can do.  And by stepping forward to look out for and protect your fellow service members, you help ensure that the force of tomorrow can be as great as the force of today."
Thank you for that.
And now we'll recognize each one of you individually.
Good afternoon.  Thank you so much for being here and…joining me in what is a great privilege – and that is to honor one of the finest strategic thinkers and policymakers of our time Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski – or as he is simply known across town and around the world: Zbig.
"As we do so, it’s a pleasure to be joined by so many friends, current and former colleagues, and dedicated public servants past and present, including John Hamre, Bob Kimmitt, Paula Dobriansky, and many more. "
"I also want to welcome Zbig’s family, his wife Emilie and his sons Mark and Ian – thank you all for being here, and for all your support for Zbig over the years.  The United States and the world owe you all a debt of gratitude.  "
"Today, I present Dr. Brzezinski with DoD’s highest civilian honor, the Distinguished Public Service Award, for his contributions to the defense of our great country.  "
"Now, it might seem odd to some of you that a Secretary of Defense would give the Department of Defense’s highest civilian award to a former Presidential National Security Advisor.  But it should not seem odd at all.  "
"That’s because this award, here and at this moment, reflects an enduring truth about America’s defense, that it is so vital that we, to whom it is entrusted, must shepherd it across the years from strategic era to strategic era, from domain to domain – not just sea and air and land, but also in cyber, electronic warfare, and space – and from presidential administration to presidential administration, across parties, and across our government.  "
"In the academy, at the White House, and now at CSIS, Zbig has long understood that the way to do just that is to have a global strategic perspective – one that helps us understand where our challenges today fall in the broad arc of history, and how we can use history’s lessons in today’s strategic environment.  Indeed, Zbig wrote in his 2012 book that “historically, America has shown that it rises to the occasion when challenged.”  But he also pointed out that today’s world and security environment present “far different challenges than those in the past.”"
"He’s right on both points.  And with his strategic vision, advice and guidance, and his example on how to further America’s interests and our ideals, the men and women of the Department of Defense are rising to meet the five major, unique, and rapidly evolving challenges we face today. "
"Indeed, we’re countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe.  We’re managing historic change in the Asia-Pacific – the single most consequential region for America’s future.  We’re strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s continued nuclear and missile provocations.  We’re checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Gulf, and protecting our friends and allies in the Middle East.  We’re accelerating the certain defeat of ISIL…destroying it in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, and everywhere else it metastasizes around the world, even as we protect our people here in the homeland.  "
"And, of course, we must continue to be flexible and agile, because, no matter how smart Zbig has been and is, when you look at history, you see that we have an imperfect record when it comes to predicting the future.  So we’re preparing to contend, in addition, with an uncertain future – ensuring that our forces, our technology, our personnel, our training, and our operational concepts are ready for challenges we may not anticipate today."
"While we don’t have the luxury of choosing among these challenges, we do have the ability to set our course strategically – so that while the world may be a confused place, we are not confused about our interests and how to protect them.  As we do so, we can learn much from Zbig.  With his one-of-a-kind wit and candor, Zbig has counseled Presidents, influenced global leaders, and educated policymakers throughout his career – including me, over the many years we’ve known each other and particularly during my time as SecDef – on how to cultivate the strategic perspective that he embodies and espouses. "
"That means keeping the world in synoptic view, seeing all of its parts and problems at once, and using the great physical and moral strengths of the world’s greatest nation wisely, to protect our people and make a better world for our children.  It means knowing which mix of the full range of foreign policy tools – including but not limited to the finest fighting force the world has ever known – is best for a given situation.  And it means keeping ever grounded in our national security interests…they’re our North Star whether in the Middle East, the Asia-Pacific, Europe, or elsewhere."
"Zbig has of course seen how dark and dangerous the world can be, particularly during World War II.  And, when in government at another time of global change, competition, and crises, he resolutely helped direct a robust, forward-leaning American foreign policy.  Whether it was confronting Soviet aggression at a time when it was heating up the Cold War, seizing a precious opportunity for peace in the Camp David Accords, or bending the arc of history by normalizing relations with China, Zbig helped keep America safe and put us in the position to continue to do so for decades to come."
"Of course, Zbig also knows well how America has long brought light to his own life, to his family, and to the world.  For that reason, Zbig understood – like few other national security professionals – that American foreign policy cannot be driven by interests and security alone.  His former special assistant and one of my predecessors as SecDef Bob Gates has written, Zbig has a “long history of blending tough-minded realism with high-minded idealism.”  That’s because he knew personally what the causes of freedom, human rights, and democracy mean to the people of the world, and thus what they can mean to American policy. "
"Blending realism with idealism is not always easy.  Indeed, Zbig was called at 3:00AM one night in 1979 and told the Soviet Union had commenced a nuclear attack on the United States with 200 missiles.  He explained years later that he knew, quote, “everybody would be dead in 28 minutes” so he said, “if that was the case, I was going to make sure we had lots of company.”  And with that Zbig, our one-man deterrent, made sure the Strategic Air Command bombers were taking off.  Thankfully, the reported Soviet attack turned out to be incorrect – Zbig was given the right information shortly thereafter, and he made sure to recall the SAC order."
"But with stakes that high, Zbig – and other officials – could be forgiven for focusing on cold calculus, on interests alone.  He’s done that, but doing that alone is a temptation he’s fought against in government and out.  He’s written that the United States must not “subordinate everything else in the world to an exaggerated sense of insecurity.” Instead, “we have to learn to live” in an insecure world with “dignity, with idealism, with steadfastness.”  Zbig has done just that in his own life."
"In an interview 25 years ago, Zbig explained that he considered the “highest human achievement” for him was to “accomplish something positive” for America his adopted country, for Poland his native land, “for the free world, and probably for human kind.”  Even after he left government, Zbig was committed to doing so, to combining thought and action, advice and advocacy, writing and lecturing in the hope of doing good and helping push events and decisions in the “right direction.”  Zbig, I think we can all agree you have done just that, and more."
"Because you’ve done so, you’ve helped ensure America has – time and again – risen to the occasion, and that as a consequence millions and millions can get up in the morning, go to school, go to work, live their lives, dream their dreams, and give their children a better future.  "
"Zbig, today we acknowledge you for your service, your strategic view, and your continued thought and action.  On behalf of the men and women of the Department of Defense, and on behalf of a grateful nation, Zbig, we thank you."
"Now, it is my great honor to present the Department of Defense highest civilian honor, the Distinguished Public Service Award, to Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski.   "
Thank you.  
"Good morning, good morning fans of Frank and fans of Joe. Glad to have you all here, and I’m certainly one of you. Chairman Dunford, Ellyn, thank you for being here. General Milley, General Goldfein, General Neller, Admiral Michel, Adjutants General, international partners, friends and family, all of you, and Ambassador, thanks for joining us. It’s good to be with you all as we pass this critical responsibility between two of our military's most accomplished leaders, General Frank Grass and General Joe Lengyel. "
"Before I speak about the character and the contributions of these two extraordinary officers, I want to speak directly to all of the citizen warriors here today, and our entire National Guard family. I’m so proud of all of you, and we’re so grateful for your vital contributions to the security of our nation.  "
"You keep our skies free from danger. You respond to disaster with compassion and professionalism at a moment’s notice. You stand watch at home and around the world. You responded when we needed you during the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan all those years. You help keep our most solemn commitment as a military, which is to provide our citizens the security they need to dream their dreams, raise their children, and live full lives, even if that means sometimes putting your own lives on hold, or on the line."
"That has been the spirit, the mission and enduring commitment of our national guard through the centuries, and never more so than over the past 15 years.  Since September 11th, the men and women of our Army and Air National Guard – and their families – have answered the nation’s call to deploy – get this – over 787,000 times."
"And as a result, today’s Guard is battle tested – an agile, flexible, deployable force with combat experience and a broad range of skills gained both on the battlefield and in civilian life. The National Guard is a critical component of our total force, bringing to bear the experience and skills of our citizen warriors wherever and whenever needed to confront the challenges of a complex world. And we’ve got them."
"Today our nation faces  – and the Guard is helping us to meet – no fewer than five major, immediate and evolving  challenges: countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe; managing historic change in the vital Asia-Pacific region; where China is rising, which is fine, but behaving aggressively, which is not; strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s nuclear and missile provocations; checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Gulf; and confronting terrorism, including accelerating the certain defeat of ISIL in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, and wherever it metastasizes. And as history has shown that we can never perfectly predict the strategic future – in fact it perfectly shows the opposite of that –we must also be flexible and agile in preparing for unknowns that we can’t anticipate today."
"We don’t have the luxury of choosing among these challenges.  We have to do it all.  And all around the world, the Guard does it all – from Eastern Europe, where the North Carolina National Guard equipped with HIMARS participated in exercises with 24 nations in Poland, to the Pacific, where the Hawaii National Guard 204th Airlift Squadron stands ready to respond throughout Pacific rim, to the Middle East – where 8,000 National Guard members are currently deployed in the air and on the ground, including the Wisconsin National Guard as it supports the 101st Airborne’s mission to enable local forces to take on ISIL and defeat ISIL."
"And right here at home, cyberwarriors like the Washington National Guard’s 262nd Network Warfare Squadron, whom I met earlier this year – wonderful, wonderful folks – are using the skills and experience they’ve gained in America’s wonderfully innovative technology community to protect our networks and to do things like counter ISIL’s influence online."
"The days of the National Guard serving exclusively as a strategic reserve – called up only in emergencies – are over. The post-9/11 environment has proven the Guard is an indispensable component of the Total Force, in day-to-day activities and large-scale operations, in planning and execution, and in conventional conflicts and novel threats.  The National Guard will remain critical to accomplishing all of our Nation’s security priorities."
"And to ensure preparedness for existing threats, the Army will double the number of rotations to the national training centers for our Guard brigade combat teams. Further, the Guard will receive an increase in the number of helicopters over the next several years, enhancing its capability as a strategic reserve and providing more flexibility for missions in the here and now including over the homeland."
"The Guard will be instrumental not only in fighting and winning on today’s battlefields, but also in shaping tomorrow’s conflicts, as well. As the cyber and space domains become increasingly contested, the Guard will be on the vanguard of these mission sets. By 2019, the National Guard will have over 30 cyber units in 34 states to support the services and US Cyber Command."
"The more deeply integrated the Guard becomes in all facets of planning and execution, the better prepared the nation becomes.  The presence, skill and readiness of citizen warriors across the country give us the agility and flexibility to handle unexpected demands, both at home and abroad. It’s an essential component of our total force, and a lynchpin of our readiness. "
"That’s one of the reasons the position of Commander of the National Guard was elevated to the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 2012. And as the first National Guard Bureau Chief to serve a full term in the tank, General Frank Grass has led this historic transition with character and skill."
"Building on the good work of his predecessor, General Craig McKinley, who is here today, General Grass worked tirelessly with General Welsh and General Milley to form the most integrated and Total Force in our history. He’s helped increase our rapid deployment capability to respond to any crisis, and strengthened the Guard’s partnerships at the local, state, federal - and international - levels. He’s been a strong and steady voice at the table for the men and women of the National Guard, because for his entire career he has personified the finest qualities of our citizen warriors. "
"Frank Grass has been committed to the defense of this nation since he turned eighteen and enlisted with the Missouri National Guard as a private in 1969. It was another former Missouri National Guardsman, President Harry Truman, who said, “Progress occurs when courageous, skillful leaders seize the opportunity to change things for the better.”"
"Well Frank, you’ve changed things for the better at every stop in your career, from your first commission in the Engineering Corps, to your steadfast protection of our homeland as Deputy Commander of NORTHCOM. And as Chief of the National Guard these past four years, you’ve been a courageous and skillful leader, exactly the nation needed, and you’ve seized every opportunity to make progress, and our total force is stronger as a result. "
"Frank, you’ve said the three critical traits of the leaders you’ve admired most are that they are analytical, decisive and compassionate – remember that? In the time we’ve served together, I’ve seen the way you’ve met all three of these standards, and as you’ve built a legacy of strength and readiness that will continue to benefit us all long into the future."
"Your analytical approach to homeland security and disaster situations has helped inform and advise the President, me and Chairman Dunford during times of challenge, and helped guide our national security planning to protect our nation at home against the threats of tomorrow."
"Your decisive actions to prioritize skills, equipment and readiness through times of budget uncertainty have turned the National Guard from a post-9/11 operational reserve of necessity into an enduring, effective operational reserve by design."
"And your compassionate dedication to our National Guard families has resulted in stronger community support networks, greater employer cooperation, and deeper connections to all who serve. You’ve never forgotten that families are the foundation of our force. I appreciate everything Pat has done for our National Guard families as well, and I also want to thank your children Amanda, Laura, Patrick and Mark – if you’re watching – and your many grandchildren, for their service through the years as well.  "
"So, Frank, as you and Pat begin your well-earned retirement, you can rest assured that the National Guard family is in the good hands of another proven strategic thinker and citizen warrior, the man who has served by your side as Vice Chief of the National Guard Bureau, General Joe Lengyel."
"Joe knows what it means to serve, too. He’s logged over 3,000 hours behind the controls of an F-16. His 34 years of distinguished military service includes operational, staff and command assignments that included services in Desert Storm, Provide Comfort, Southern Watch, and Enduring Freedom among others."
"But perhaps most importantly, Joe knows what it means to be a military family. He knows the meaning of service, sacrifice, and separation. When Joe’s father, here present, Sir, Lieutenant Colonel Lauren Lengyel, was shot down over Vietnam in August of 1967 and held as a prisoner of war for six years, it fell to Joe’s mother Margaret to raise Joe, his sister Dottie, and his brothers Dan and Greg, who’s now, himself a Major General in the Air Force."
"The poet John Milton once wrote, “They also serve who only stand and wait.” Well, Joe’s entire family served through those long years of uncertainty and strain, and they continued to serve when Joe’s dad returned to service in Vietnam in 1975, one of only two former POW pilots to do so. Joe’s parents are here today, as you all know, as is his brother, and I want to take a moment to thank them for their service and sacrifice."
"We pray that no military family ever has to go through Joe’s experience growing up again, but we know that every deployment, every separation is a strain. And I’m confident that Joe will continue the good work Frank has done in strengthening community and employer support for our warriors, and particularly for our military families before, during and after deployments."
"Our greatest resource is our people, and there’s no finer example than Joe’s family. Today we’re joined by his wife Sally – Sally, welcome aboard…you’ve been aboard for a while, but you’re stepping up here – an Air Force veteran herself, his daughter Katie, and sons Joe and Mike, who, like his father, is an F-16 pilot. I know that the men and women of our National Guard, and the families that stand by them, will be well served by General Joe Lengyel who is not only an accomplished pilot and experienced commander, but is also a military son, husband, brother and a father."
"Now, it’s a big world out there, and we are a great nation, with extraordinary responsibilities, opportunities, and challenges around the world and around the block. We cannot predict how, or when, or where, the men and women of our National Guard will be called on to serve their fellow citizens.  "
"But we know that thanks to the strong and steady leadership of General Frank Grass, the National Guard of today is an indispensable force, trained and ready to respond wherever it’s needed.  And we know that General Lengyel will lead this force with certainty, clarity, and the full confidence and trust of myself and the President. "
"To General Lengyel, to General Grass, and to all the men and women of the National Guard, thank you for everything you do, and for always remaining, “Always Ready, Always There.”"
"Thanks. Good afternoon everyone.  First of all, these are hard acts to follow, so let’s just take a moment and recognize these five folks.  I’m inspired by you guys, really am, thanks.  And I’m going to tell you – they told great stories from today – and I’m going to start out by telling you a story from yesterday.  Long time yesterday, almost a century ago…and it goes like this: "
"There was a 22-year-old sales clerk named Frieda Greene.  Frieda Greene was sitting at her family’s dinner table in Portsmouth, Ohio, when her father mentioned that the U.S. Navy was recruiting women to serve in World War I.  Despite the fact that there was a world war raging at the time, Frieda said without hesitation, “That’s for me!”"
"And while her family did not pay much attention to that exclamation, they did a few days later when she called home and said, “Mamma, I just joined the Navy!”  Though her mother objected, her father said, “Let her go.”  And go Frieda did, serving as a so-called ‘yeomanette’ in the U.S. Navy.  "
"When this beautiful memorial was being christened in 1997, almost 30,000 people came out here to honor the women who have served our country in uniform.  And at that ceremony, they  heard from  101-year-old veteran Frieda Greene, and she spoke that day about what her service had meant to her…at the other end of life’s arc from these spectacular women we’ve heard from today.  And she encouraged – like they did – others to serve as well.  To those women serving at the time, and those women thinking of military service, she echoed her father’s words, and told them, “Go for it.”"
"And so, General McWilliams, ladies and gentlemen, veterans and servicemembers, DoD leaders and colleagues, family and friends – today, we come together to honor once again all those who’ve gone for it, and gone for all of us.  Servicemembers like those who shared their stories with us a moment ago and others here today.  As we do, we remember those who’ve served in the past, we reaffirm our dedication to the force today, and we also recommit ourselves to building the force of the future."
"The men and women of today’s force and the force of the future will inherit a remarkable legacy.  Since the nation’s founding, each of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, Coast Guardsmen, and veterans – men and women… active, guard, and reserve – has done one of the noblest things a person can do with their life, which is to help defend our magnificent country and make a better world for our children.  And along the way, as the world and war have changed, they’ve fought when necessary, adapted to fit the times, and prepared for the future."
"Together, they won for the United States its independence in the Revolutionary War, and they helped bring America back together in the Civil War.  They fought in the Great War, whose armistice we also mark today, and later won the Second World War.  Then they went on to serve with distinction all over the globe – in the waters off Korea, in the jungles of Vietnam, and in the desert sands of Kuwait, just to name a few.  And, of course, since September 11th, some 4.9 million Americans have joined our military to serve in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere...including as we sit here right now this afternoon."
"While some continue to serve today, many others have chosen to leave the armed forces.  Now, as Secretary of Defense, I have to tell you that’s not always easy for me, because I hate to see our great people go…but at the same time, here’s how I console myself, and remember that it’s a good thing.  Because when they transition to a good job, or start their own business, or work in public service, or volunteer in their community, they show future generations that the military can be more than a good place to be; it’s also a good place to be from.  And that has tremendous value as we recruit their replacements.  And you know, I remember a time when it was different.  I’m old enough to remember a time when it was different, and I’m so proud today that our employers and our citizens recognize what spectacular contributors our veterans are.   "
"That’s one of many reasons why DoD is committed to helping our servicemembers transition when they move on to whatever’s next for them in life, so that they can succeed – we can help them succeed – in every way possible.  Because while we know it’s a loss for our military, we also know our country will gain from their contributions from their amazing skills and discipline and experience, when these dedicated, driven, and awesomely capable soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen become dedicated, driven, and awesomely capable veterans.  And as they do, they’re always part of our team, and we wish them well, we honor them, and we thank them – as a department, as a military, and as an ever-grateful nation. "
"Now, those who follow in their footsteps of all those veterans – that is our men and women serving today – comprise, no other way to say it, the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  And we need that excellence, because today we’re confronting no fewer than five immediate, unique, and evolving challenges. "
"They, for us, are countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe.  They’re managing historic change in the Asia-Pacific region – the single region of greatest consequence for America’s future.  They’re strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s continued missile and nuclear provocations.  They’re checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Gulf, and helping defend our friends and allies in the Middle East.  They’re accelerating the certain defeat of ISIL…destroying ISIL’s parent tumor in Syria and Iraq, and everywhere else it metastasizes around the world, even as they help protect our people here in the homeland.  And they’re preparing, moreover, to contend, with an uncertain future – ensuring that we continue to be ready for challenges we may not even anticipate today. All that, they’re doing for us as we sit here now."
"And as Secretary of Defense, my first commitment is to our people, to our men and women in uniform because I know that’s what makes our military the greatest – committed to their excellence, and to their welfare – to making sure they’re treated with dignity and respect, and above all, making certain that when they’re sent into harm’s way, it’s done with the utmost reflection and care.  "
"I’m doing everything I can to support the strength and readiness of today’s force – investing in the right training, the right force size, the right equipment, and the right compensation and benefits that our troops, military families, and DoD civilians deserve.  "
"And of course, our support for today’s force includes our commitment to help care for our military’s wounded, ill, and injured, and support our military families, because they serve, too.  It includes our enduring pledge to support the families of the fallen, whose loved ones made the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of us and our country, like those laid to rest here at Arlington.  And it also includes what we’re doing to ensure the dignity of our people, which is why we’ve been prioritizing the prevention and elimination of sexual harassment and sexual assault in the military.  "
"Now, even as our force of today is outstanding and meeting the challenges we face, the Pentagon has to continue to adapt and change to build what I call the force of the future and – to think as I like to say outside of our five-sided box – to ensure we stay the best.  And we can’t take that for granted, because as generations change, as technology changes, and as labor markets change, as kids change, we need to stay competitive and continue to attract and retain the most talented young people that America has to offer.  "
"And we’re doing that with several changes to the management of the talent of our all-volunteer force, but given this setting here today, I’ll focus on one part of this effort – my decision almost a year ago to open up all combat positions to women without exception. "
"I made this decision so we can benefit from the service of every American who can meet our high standards and contribute to our mission.  In the 21st century, and in an all-volunteer force, that requires us to be able to draw talent from the broadest possible pool of qualified Americans.  And that includes women, because they make up more than 50 percent of our population."
"To succeed in our mission therefore, we cannot afford to cut ourselves off from half of the country’s talents and skills.  We have to take full advantage of every individual who can meet our standards.  That is mission critical."
"Any woman who qualifies can now contribute to our mission in ways they could not before.  They can drive tanks, they can fire mortars, they can lead infantry soldiers into combat.  They can serve as Army Rangers and Green Berets, Navy SEALs, Marine Corps infantry, Air Force parajumpers, and everything else that was previously open only to men.  "
"And as a result, any woman in uniform will be able to realize her full potential.  That’s important because while we had previously benefitted from the skills and perspectives of women, like Yeomanette Frieda Greene a century ago and millions of others, they had long only been allowed to serve in limited roles or had limited  opportunities simply because of their gender.  That was bad talent management, and it also wrong.  And that’s why we ended it. "
"And now, I’m proud to say that everyone who’s able and willing to serve their country, and who can meet our high standards, has the full and equal opportunity to do so.  "
"So today, we honor every American, and now that’s a wider group, every American who has stepped forward to serve…those like Frieda Greene who did long ago.  The more than 20 million veterans living today.  And the more than 2 million Americans serving in uniform at this very moment across this country and around the clock, in every time zone on earth, and in every domain…in the air, ashore, afloat, in cyberspace – all in service to this great nation."
"You know, it’s said that security is like oxygen…when you have enough of it, you pay no attention to it.  "
"But when you don’t have it, you can think of nothing else.  America’s servicemembers have long provided the oxygen…the security that allows millions and millions of people, not just in America, but in so much of the world to be safe, to raise their children, to dream their dreams, to live lives that are full, and to leave behind a better world."
"In each of the five challenges, and at a time of great change and competition in our world, we must and will continue to provide that oxygen.  "
"To do so, we’ve changed how we plan and how we operate, how we fight and whom we allow to do the fighting, but we’ll never change what we’re fighting for:  for our safety and freedoms, for those of our friends and allies, and for our values and principles.  "
"Our people make all of that possible.  Whether they’ve served years ago, are serving right now, or are just joining what will be our force of the future, I couldn’t be prouder of our men and women for what they do every day – and for what they have done – for us.  Stephanie and I wake up for them every morning."
Their excellence is unparalleled.  Their service is invaluable.  And their sacrifices will never be forgotten.
May God bless them.  May God bless the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  And may God continue to bless the United States of America. 
"SECRETARY OF DEFENSE JAMES N. MATTIS:  This will be on the record initially, and then at some point we'll go off the record, unless we take too long."
"I do have -- okay, we've got at least a half hour, 35 minutes at least, OK."
So you all set?  Good to go?
"First of all, again, usually, I ruin your entire weekend.  Today at least you got breakfast Sunday with your family, you know, so I'm getting a little kinder, gentler, getting more in touch with my softer side here, but I do appreciate your going, again, on a weekend, as always, since we try to use non-workdays to do a lot of the travel, and you can understand why."
"First, I have to welcome Senator Dan Sullivan.  He's a Marine, and he's a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and I actually knew him when he was number 100 in seniority in the Senate.  It's some -- just a few years ago, but he's rapidly become, for the Pacific, one of our key go-to legislators, House or Senate, and that obviously, that one of the five states we have, plus Guam territories, and all that have Pacific Ocean frontage so to speak, and so he has a keen interest in the Pacific."
"I'm going up with senator to review a number of things up in the great state of Alaska.  And just so you know, I'm not patronizing him.  Remember, that state has 20 percent of the landmass of the entire lower 48, so it truly is a great state, Senator."
"SENATOR DAN SULLIVAN:  Thank you, Mr. Secretary."
"SEC. MATTIS:  Sure.  So welcome to Senator Sullivan, the Senate Armed Service Committee, and a great ally, as are all the members of that committee to the Department of Defense and its readiness, both near term and long term.  This is my seventh trip to the Indo-Pacific region, since coming in about, what is it now, 17 months ago, 16 months ago, and it's got 36 countries in the region, 50 percent of the world's population, and over one-third of the global economic output."
"The first stop on the trip is going to be Alaska.  We'll get to Eielson.  It's where we're going to land initially, home of the 34th Fighter Wing, which is a unit I want to see there, home to other units as well of course.  It's got a great history of fighting for America, and it's been stationed everywhere.  It's been stationed in Florida, somewhat different than Alaska in terms of the geography and the weather.  It's been a NATO fighter squadron -- or fighter wing.  It's been deployed to Lebanon back a long time ago, Vietnam, Korea, the Mideast, and from World War II to day."
"It's been all over the place as you can see.  Much of our history, military history is written in the location that wing has been.  It's now dedicated to ensuring aviation units are as lethal as possible in high end combat.  It hosts one of our foremost joint training exercises every year, the Red Flag Alaska, which is a great opportunity, and a number of our allies go there for the high quality training.  It's got an instrumented range, it's really a first class national treasure when it comes to a training range."
"We'll also visit tomorrow Fort Greely.  It's an opportunity for me to see the ground-based interceptor capability up there, and that follows my visit to STRATCOM back here, Minot Air Force Base.  As you know, up in the Dakotas it's part of the constellation of capabilities that are critical to the defense of our homeland and our allies.  It's also one of the coldest places in Alaska, and probably on Earth.  The fort dates back to World War II, and it remains a key location today in our nation's defense. "
We'll go back from there to the Air Force Base.  We'll -- I think we'll see you all there.
"Dana, are they going to be at the press gaggle that we'll have there with the local press as well, there at Eielson before we launch to head out to Beijing?"
(Crosstalk)
"This is my first trip to China, but it does follow two meeting with interlocutors last year.  The first one was Mar-a-Lago, and the second one was in Washington, D.C.  The first one was with President Xi, President Trump at Mar-a-Lago, and our counterparts for secretary of state and myself."
"The second one was in Foggy Bottom, State Department, and that was what we call a two-plus-two, secretary of state, secretary of defense, and our counterparts from China."
"To the consultations, as you probably already know, they're designed to exchange strategic perspective, discuss areas of mutual concern, determine where was have common interests, and where our interests diverge, and continue to speak with one another."
"On our relations with China, obviously reviewing our mil-to-mil relationship, military to military, military between military relationships, make sure it's aligned within our larger strategic framework, and both our nations, we believe, and all nations in the Pacific, have an interest in a safe, secure, prosperous and free Indo-Pacific region. "
"After a couple of days there, we'll launch out of there, and we'll go into Seoul, where I'll meet with Minister of Defense Song, and perhaps other leaders, but Minister of Defense Song is my counterpart, Admiral Song, former admiral in the ROK, Republic of Korea Navy.  We maintain very, very strong links between us, close and continuous consultation.  The alliance is very strong.  We share that commitment to protect our shared democratic values.  That has come through loud and clear with the new administration continuing in Seoul what we had in past administrations."
"And alongside the People's Republic of China and Japan, the United States and the Republic of Korea have a common goal.  That's the complete irreversible and verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and this will include our agreed upon reduction to larger-scale exercises, and between Minister Moon and I, we'll consult on the way ahead."
"I've seen him most recently in Singapore, saw him a couple of days before that in Hawaii and the change of command for Indo-Pacific Command, and we continue to maintain that close consultation, but phone calls since between -- since the meetings in Singapore, as well as a number of meetings, where he's come to Washington, and I've been to Seoul, as you know."
"The final stop on the trip will be in Tokyo.  We also work very closely with Tokyo on the way ahead, on denuclearization, which is a fundamental issue as you all understand, for the safety of the Japanese people, and I'll be meeting with Minister Onodera, with whom I have been in close consultation as well, and mutually supporting between our two nations and our military activities.  In our relationship, we recognize Japanese concerns for the short-range and medium-range ballistic missiles, the abductions of the Japanese girls over many years, and broader security issues across the Pacific."
"Let me just swing off the trip for a moment and talk a little bit about other things going on over the last several days in other theaters.  One, in northeast Syria, this is the area with the Syrian Democratic Forces, as our partners there.  Basically the Syrians, they're partners with our counter-ISIS, Defeat ISIS Coalition.  The Syrian Democratic Forces and Iraqi Security Forces successfully linked up last night along the border of Iraq and Syria.  They were firing in support of each other as they closed in on the enemy there in Hasakah Province of Syria."
"Basically Hasakah Province for the first time since 2013 is now cleared of all ISIS main force element.  That is a significant achievement.  Border operations were very well coordinated back and forth between the Iraqi Security Forces the Syrian Democratic Forces, and so we will continue that along the border, now that they've linked up, driving north and south along that border."
"So that's where we stand on the Defeat ISIS Coalition, still hard fighting ahead, as I've told you.  Ever since June -- and some of you are questioning whether ISIS was completely taken down.  I said just bear with us; there's still hard fighting ahead.  It's been hard fighting, and again, we win every time our forces go up against them.  We've lost no terrain to them once it's been taken."
"There's been a lot of questions about our support for border operations.  As you know, this is led by Department of Homeland Security and Secretary Nielsen. "
"Right now we are in close alignment with them, as they have come to us, asking us to build out temporary camps on two of our bases..."
(TAPE BREAK)
"SEC. MATTIS:  ... refugees.  They were put in U.S. military bases for months as -- as it was worked out, how they would be dealt with."
"And there's -- we've done it for victims of natural disasters, whatever forced them out of their homes.  So DHS is in the lead.  You'll have to talk to DHS about policy and that sort of thing.  We're in a logistic support response mode to the -- the Department of Homeland Security. "
"On the -- here in a couple of days, probably about three days, if I remember right, Exercise RIMPAC will begin out here in the Pacific.  Basically, it's the largest naval exercise in the world. "
"And it'll begin on the 27th, go for a few weeks, many different activities both shoreside and at sea.  Exchanges between -- between international navies.  The idea is to maintain transparency, to maintain understanding of what each other is doing."
"Navies can be one of the most stabilizing influences, in terms of counter-piracy, freedom of navigation, disaster relief, humanitarian support for various folks.  You've seen all this happening, whether it be in the Mediterranean or in the Pacific, over -- or the Indian Ocean over many years."
"So navies that work transparently -- transparently as stabilizing factors are there.  Again, I believe it's 26 navies.  I may have one -- might be one or two more or less.  So don't quote me on the number, there, but it's around two -- it's over two dozen, I believe."
"Let me switch over for just a minute, to the -- the repatriation of remains and where are we at on that.  As you know, there was an agreement coming out of the Singapore summit, that the -- they would begin, once again, repatriating remains."
"The United Nations Command in ROK, in the Republic of Korea, is prepared, now, to receive those remains.  They have staged appropriate logistics materials, and we simply are standing by for whenever the -- the diplomatic activities are done.  And we're optimistic that it will begin because that was an agreement coming out of -- coming out of Singapore."
"I would just say that the reason the United Nations Command is going to be the one receiving them, and not the ROK military alone or the U.S. military alone, is because, as you know, there were somewhere just short of two dozen countries that were part of the sending states and had troops committed from 1950 to 1953."
"They were countries from all over the world.  And the sending states, by and large, most of them lost troop -- now missing troops.  So the first thing that'll happen if they're turned over to us at the border, subsequent to that, they would be moved down to Osan. "
"There, they will be checked to make sure that they appear to be what they think -- we think they are, just to make sure that they're probably from either western countries or other countries that were sending states."
"And then -- that'll take a couple days, maybe a week.  Then they'll be sent in to Hickam Air Force Base which is located in Hawaii.  And that's where the forensic identification lab is located.  That will then go through and try to make matches on them. "
"So that's what's going on with that.  In Afghanistan, as you know, some months ago, President Ghani offered a -- offered to talk with the Taliban.  Their response about a month later, two months later was to announce their spring offensive, but did not -- which did not get off to a very good start."
"Ghani again offered a ceasefire.  They agreed to three days of it.  Ghani offered an extension.  They did not accept that, but it was quite interesting to see how, among Taliban and Afghans, there were people sharing the -- breaking the fast meal at the end of Eid."
"Clearly, Ghani has hit a responsive chord that was not just on the Afghan national government side.  It also cut deep into the Taliban. "
"So we'll see how this goes forward.  On the -- in regard to the Pakistan Taliban at the same time, the -- the forces engaged against the terrorists basically killed Fazlullah, the head of the Pakistan Taliban.  He's well known for ordering the attack on the school that killed -- I think it was around 130 -- well over a hundred mostly pupils, mostly children going to school, plus their teachers."
"I've been to Swat.  He was the one who ordered the attack in the Swat, and one of the most stunningly beautiful places you'll ever go on Earth, I'll tell you.  If you've -- for those of you who ever get there, for a good trekking opportunity."
"There, his reign was known until the Pakistan military threw him out, for the beheadings he was able to carry out there to impose his will, which didn't last long but was certainly murderous while he was there."
"He also ordered the murder of Malala, the teenage girl who recommended -- or advocated -- strongly represented education for children and received the Nobel Peace Prize for her leadership at a very young age.  Leadership by example.  He was the one who ordered her to be murdered as well.  So the bottom line is, he's dead. "
"Now, why don't we go to questions… we've got a few minutes to take questions."
"Yes, Lita?"
"Q:  Mr. Secretary, one quick, easy question.  Have you been to China before, prior to your service as secretary, or..."
"SEC. MATTIS:  Yes.  The question is, have I been to China before, even before I was secretary.  No.  I've been -- I spent several -- I think it's either three or -- it's been more than -- I think more than three court visits in Hong Kong, back while it was still under British dominion."
"And then I was there, also, in 2001, I believe..."
Q:  Hong Kong?
"SEC. MATTIS:  Hong Kong, again, yes.  Hong Kong.  So."
Q:  But...
SEC. MATTIS:  Hong Kong only.
"Q:  When you were in Singapore, you had some pretty strong language for the Chinese at the time.  What is your message, going into these meetings with the Chinese?  Are you going to be, do you think, as strident as you were about the South China Sea and other issues, or do you have bigger, broader goals for your discussions with them?"
SEC. MATTIS:  I think -- I think the way to address issues between our two nations is to first establish a transparent strategic dialogue.  How do they see the relationship with us?  The Chinese see the relationship with us developing.
We shared how we see it developing.  And the way to get to be other issues that are vexing is to start with strategic transparency as a way to get to operational transparency.  So that would be my message.
Q:  Can you explain that a little more?
"SEC. MATTIS:  No, I'd prefer not to right now.  I want to go in and have an open discussion with my counterpart."
"Q:  Could I follow up on that?  You mentioned you were reviewing the mil-to-mil program.  Obviously, in light of the South China Sea, there's been a number of incidents.  The laser incident in Djibouti. "
What -- what do you -- are -- are you going to scale back the -- the mil-to-mil program?
"SEC. MATTIS:  Yeah.  I -- I generally do not talk, as some of you know who have been on a trip with me before, I don't generally talk about what I will do in the future or will not do."
"I would tell you that -- going forward, that we obviously look at the actions of China.  But I've made -- I'm going there to do a lot of listening and -- and identification of common ground and uncommon ground on the strategic level at this time."
"Q:  And what -- what is your expectations of your talks in Beijing, do you have any..."
"SEC. MATTIS:  No, no, I'd prefer not to go in with those expectations.  And go in and see -- see what we can work out. "
Q:  Sir...
SEC. MATTIS:  Yeah?
Q:  Do you think you can expand a little bit on where you think your interests -- or the U.S. interests with China converge?  And also can Beijing play a role in the kind of burgeoning peace talks in...
SEC. MATTIS:  In what?
Q:  In the -- in the kind of nascent peace talks in Afghanistan? 
SEC. MATTIS:  OK.  You -- you know where our interests converge.  You know that the -- the People's Republic of China also want to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.  That's their policy.
"But by and large, I want to go in and take a measure for where they're at today, and see where our interests converge.  I think you've mentioned one that I won't be surprised would be on the table as an area where we agreed to work together, which has to do with counterterrorism."
"But at the same time, I'm going in to do the listening this time.  And make certain that where we can, we can engage in a transparent strategic conversation."
Missy?
"Q:  Just a quick follow-up on China, and then I have my separate question on the border.  On China, you know, the -- China's been identified in the National Defense Strategy as one of the main areas of focus for the U.S. military, going forward."
"And they've invested a lot and apparently have made a lot of technological advances.  Can you just sort of say, on the record, what China represents in terms of a military competitor for the United States?"
And then on the border issue...
"SEC. MATTIS:  That's a great question.  That's why I'm going there.  I want to understand how they see the strategic relationship developing.  And first of all, hear in their words how they see this going strategically."
I do not want to immediately go in with a -- a certain pre-set expectation of what they are going to say.  I -- I want to go in and do a lot of listening.  I'll be very clear on what we see developing. 
"But that -- that's -- that's the whole reason I'm making the trip instead of just sitting in Washington and reading news reports, intelligence reports or analyst reports.  That's why -- that's -- really, your question cuts to the heart. "
"What was your second question, Missy?"
Q:  On the border issue...
SEC. MATTIS:  On which border?  Our border.
"Q:  Yeah, our border.  I -- you said that the -- that the Defense Department was looking at two possible sites to house migrants..."
SEC. MATTIS:  That's right.
"Q:  Can you clarify, will those be adults or will those be families of children and men?  And, you know, you -- you said the other day, when -- in  addressing this issue, that the Defense Department would do whatever was in best -- the best interest of the United States, as it had in the past..."
SEC. MATTIS:  Right.
"Q:  ... in broaching this issue.  But this is an issue that really -- the separation of families is a whole issue at the border right now, it's really generated intense backlash."
"Can you just -- I know that it's a DHS lead issue.  But because of the Defense Department's involvement, can you just speak to that a little bit more?"
"SEC. MATTIS:  Certainly.  Providing shelter for people without shelter, we consider that to be a logistics function that is quite appropriate. "
Q:  (off mic)
SEC. MATTIS:  No.  Go ahead. 
SEC. MATTIS:  Say that again?
SEC. MATTIS:  Can I say which one's they are?
STAFF:  (off mic)
"SEC. MATTIS:  Yeah.  Let me find out if we can.  I -- I don't have any problem with that, I just want to make certain that..."
Q:  Sure.
SEC. MATTIS:  ... we're far enough down the decision tree that I'm not being pre-decisional.  I think we can get that word to you just within an hour or two.
"Oh, wait, it's Sunday.  Certainly by tomorrow morning, you'll have that.  OK?  Just -- it's just dependent on whether I would get a hold of the right people."
Q:  That's great.  Thank you.
"Q:  And then before the trip, we were told that, basically, you know, the -- the decision to cancel the exercises, and that -- that could be reversed if necessary and that the United States would go..."
SEC. MATTIS:  What was necessary?
"Q:  It could -- it could be reversed, the decision.  You could put it back on if the North Koreans weren't operating in good faith."
"And I'm sort of wondering, you know, we were given the sense that we would know pretty soon, whether or not the North Koreans were operating in good faith."
So...
Q:  Could you give us a sense of how you'd do that?
"SEC. MATTIS:  Well, listen, folks, you know that we're in historic -- I would even call it initial discussions with the -- with the DPRK negotiators. "
"So right now, I want our -- I want the diplomats, as they have been since January 22nd, in -- in the lead on this.  And they will determine how they're going to make progress.  I'll say how.  We anticipate the progress to be made, and as it was decided in Singapore, the large joint combined effort sizes have been suspended, I would just say, and we'll see if the continuing negotiations keep them that way."
"But right now, they've been suspended.  That's what I can say and I'm not going to -- I don't have a crystal ball.  No one does.  It's up to the -- the diplomats to make sure this goes OK."
Q:  Do you you have any expectations as to whether we’ll know or not…
"SEC. MATTIS:  I -- I don't -- I don't create expectation like that.  I -- I've been on the phone with Secretary Pompeo every day of the last four days, including yesterday."
"So we maintain very close collaboration.  I mean, extremely close collaboration.  So he'll keep me posted.  I have absolute faith in him. "
"Yeah, Jordan?."
Q:  You said -- our sense was that the large exercises would be handled like Freedom Guardian.  But why did you choose to cancel the other marine exchange programs?
SEC. MATTIS:  We considered both to be consistent with what the two heads of state had come out with.
"Yeah, go ahead."
"Q:  Mr. Secretary.  Just going back to the situation at the border, the U.S. border.  Are you comfortable -- this is the issue that, obviously, it's inflamed political passions all..."
SEC. MATTIS:  Yeah.
Q:  Are you comfortable with the military becoming more deeply involved?  And is it concerning to you as a military perspective becoming  involved in an issue...
"SEC. MATTIS:  Yeah.  As you know, the military does not get involved with contact with illegal migrants.  They do not get involved physically.  They do not have any collaboration.  That is done by the professionals of ICE and the Department of Homeland Security."
"This is something that we can do -- again, whether it be refugee boat people from Vietnam, people who have been knocked out of their homes by a hurricane.  Absolutely, it's appropriate the military provide logistic support however it's -- however it's needed."
"Yes, go ahead."
"Q:  On China, could you step back and characterize the relationship, the military relationship at this point.  Is it -- given their advantage in the South Chinese Sea, their heightened talk about Taiwan, the technology theft.  Is this as bad as it was in -- with Russia in the '50s and '60s?"
SEC. MATTIS:  Say that last part again?
"Q:  Is it as bad as, the relationship, as bad as, say, Russia in the '50s and '60s?"
"SEC. MATTIS:  Well, I wouldn't characterize it that way.  We have larger issues, and you see those being handled with trade negotiations, with the Department of State, to their Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Communications."
"And, again, you know, I -- I'm going there to get what I consider to be, straight from them, what -- what they see for a strategic relationship."
"And so I want to go in, right now, without basically poisoning the well at this point, as if my mind's already made up; I'm going there to have a conversation."
Q:  Could I follow up on...
Q:  One of -- the U.S. warned Russia not to be bombing...
Q:  ... Southern Syria.  Can you talk about the Russian bombing?
"Q:  The -- we warned them not to, but nothing's happened since they started it. "
"SEC. MATTIS:  Well, we're looking very closely at what's going on down there.  That -- that, as you know, the most complex -- I'd call it security challenge anywhere.  What's going on in Syria. "
"And I met last Friday with the king of Jordan, who's in town to meet with our president.  I have been on the phone with several of our allies in the region, partners in the region.  And it's right now in the secretary of state's hands, to work this forward."
OK.   Let's go off the record now.
"Hello, everyone"
"At ease, please."
You guys look magnificent. 
"Well, thank you. Thanks for that introduction. I want to thank your Superintendent also, who I've known for a long time, Lieutenant General Johnson - a very respected leader in the Department, not just in the Air Force, but throughout the Department - your Dean, Brigadier General Armacost also, and your Commandant. You all have great leadership, I've got to tell you. Your commandant, Brigadier General Williams - all of them. I thank them for welcoming me here today.  And I want to thank all of you here today for embracing the awesome responsibility of leadership you will assume upon commissioning - leadership to accomplish the noblest thing that I believe a young person can do, which is to protect America, and also much of the rest of the world, which still depends so much on us for their security."
"And I like to say that security is like oxygen. When you have it, you don't think about it. But when you don't have it, it's all you can think about.  And the great gift that we give to Americans is to give them that security that allows them to get up in the morning, take their kids to school, go to work, live their lives, dream their dreams, live lives that are full. A lot of people around the world don't get that, but that's what we owe to our own people, and that's what you'll provide to our own people.
And there's no better feeling than being a part of that mission. You'll have that feeling. From cyberspace to outer space to the defense of the commons, the Air Force, our Air Force, benefits the human family not just in this country, but around the world; gives them security, gives them peace of mind.  And as you step forward into what is really a new and a complex world, our nation is counting on you, on your professionalism, on your pursuit of innovation, and most of all your principled leadership.
So before I get to your questions, I want to take some time to discuss the strategic landscape into which you will soon figure. And I want to convey to you briefly several of the lessons that I need and expect you to carry with you from this extraordinary institution, into the great challenges you'll confront in your career.
Now, today we in the United States and around the world face no fewer than five major immediate evolving, but immediate challenges. First, countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe; managing historic change in the vital Asia- Pacific region, which will be in your lifetimes the single region of the world of most consequence for America. It's where half of humankind lives, half of the global economy, and that's only increasing. We play a pivotal role there in keeping the peace and we're going to do that and need to do that into the future, and air power is going to be critical to that. Strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea's nuclear provocations. Checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Persian Gulf. And of course, accelerating the defeat, the certain defeat of ISIL in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, and then everywhere it's metastasized around the world, and all the while protecting the homeland.
Now, we don't have the luxury of choosing among all these challenges. We have to deal with them all. And they may all affect your career in some way at different times because your service will span decades.  Maybe a future Chief of Staff or a future Chairman of the Joint Chiefs is in this room right now.  And history tells us that ten, twenty years from now, new challenges we don't even foresee and aren't among the ones I just named, will almost certainly arise.  So to help you prepare and succeed today, lead and thrive in an uncertain and complex future, I want to tell you about four commitments that I have that guide me every day in what I do, and that I want you to have and make also, and take with you as you leave this place."
"The first commitment is to ground all of your training, all of your thinking and all of your actions in our core mission of the Department of Defense: our primary obligation will always be protecting our people and serving our nation's interests."
"When I sit with the President in the situation room, we're always focused on America's interests because that's what matters most. Some regions of the world are exceedingly messy, but we're not daunted or confused because we have our North Star. "
"And we also recognize that protecting American interests often means leading other nations and other peoples, and leading by example. Ever since World War II, the United States has stood as the world's foremost leader, partner and underwriter of stability and security in every region of the world. It is a mantle we embraced again following the Cold War. And one that continues today to the great benefit of this nation, but also the rest of the world. "
"The positive and enduring partnerships the United States has cultivated with other nations around the world are built on our interests. They understand that. But they can also see that it's built on our values, which most find decent, honorable and attractive. One thing I hear consistently from foreign leaders is how much they like working with you; how much they like working with the men and women of the United States military.  They want to work with you not just because you're capable and competent, and have an awesome force, but also because of the way you conduct yourselves. They can trust you."
Other nations know that you'll treat them with respect; that we take their interests into account even as we pursue our own interests. And that trust creates opportunities to defend our interests. 
"The Air Force provides the United States unprecedented global power and reach. But these are assets of greatest benefit to our nation and interests when they're applied in ways that are consistent with our values. So for example, when a natural disaster occurs on the other side of the world, and that's not the reason we have an air force, but we bring it to bear. And it's often you - it's often the United States Air Force that's first on the scene to deliver aid and demonstrate our values to the world."
"And I can tell you, that really creates an impression in people's minds. I hear it all the time. ""We were in trouble and you came and helped us out."" They don't forget that. Young people see it. It leaves an impression of what America is about."
"Also, you know, when we target our enemies, which we're doing right now as I stand here right now, as night falls over Syria and Iraq and the rest of the Middle East. As we target our enemies, which we have to do, we take utmost care to protect innocent life. And when we do that, we demonstrate our values. "
"Whether you're flying over the skies of Syria or Iraq or standing vigilant watch with the Air Force of the Republic of Korea, or defending assets in space or cyberspace, standing with our strong, secure, reliable nuclear arsenal, the bedrock of our security, allowing people around the world to communicate, to have the opportunity to protect our interests, demonstrate our values, and be the difference our military can make in the world.  Your individual actions will be a clear reflection of our values and our leadership in the world. "
"This next commitment, the second one, the one that's echoed through generations of the military, is that it's our people, and it's your people when you become a commander, who make our military the finest fighting force the world has ever known. And it's our people who will ensure that the force of tomorrow, which you will command, remains as great as the force of today."
"That's why I'm so intent on building what I call the force of the future, because we have to continue to recruit and retain the very best talent for what is, after all, an all-volunteer force - people as fine as you - and we need to do that as generations change, technology changes, families change, and job markets change."
"And we can't take that for granted. That's, for example, why we're opening all combat positions to women because we want to select our force from the maximum possible population. It's about combat readiness, remember that."
"From the first classes of female cadets, including Brigadier General Allison Hickey and your own Superintendent, General Johnson, to the first female combat pilots, including my former special assistant, Brigadier General Jeanne Levitt, to General Lori Robinson who tomorrow will become the first woman to lead a combatant command. I'll do the change of command tomorrow morning right here. The Air Force in these officers has proven time and time again that we're strongest when we draw from the entire strength of the nation. Females, after all, make up half the population, right? It would be foolish to pass over qualified people for any reason that has no bearing on their ability to serve with excellence."
"Third, I want you to remember that our nation's defense rests on being able to find solutions to seemingly intractable problems. And that's only going to be more so in the future. In many situations, you're going to expect - you're going to encounter unexpected challenges. I told you. I told you what we're up to today, and that's plenty. But I also told you we don't know what waits tomorrow; that we need to be ready for that, too. In some instances you'll be confronted with life or death decisions at a moment's notice. "
"Have the courage to accept risk and solve those problems, and the wisdom to determine when that risk becomes a gamble. You're responsible for the lives of your people in the accomplishment of your mission. Balancing these two solemn duties is one of the most difficult tasks you'll face, but you've got to succeed. That's the burden of command."
"When you plan, rehearse, and execute your missions, you must also be able to reevaluate the situation; reevaluate constantly; and take a new course of action when the situation demands it. And to chart a new course, you must have the confidence to be open to new ideas. "
"At the Pentagon, I've made it a priority to encourage people at all levels to think outside what I call our five-sided box, because we are a learning organization. And people are constantly developing new ways of operating and approaching problems that we're at our best."
"The culture of learning you have experienced on this campus can't end with your graduation. You're warriors first, but you're also scientists, mathematicians, and much more. Every day, you crack the code in some way. We need you to continue doing so."
"This should be a lesson for our enemies. Never underestimate the ingenuity of American officers. It's a competitive world out there. And we need to maintain competitive advantage over our enemies. They're trying, too. They're evolving. They're adapting. They're trying to go faster. We need to be better."
" That's why as part of our Force of the Future initiative, we're creating more opportunities for you to work in advanced industries and tech companies for a time in the course of your careers so you can learn from other parts of our society and our economy that are very innovative, and bring that strength back into our military."
"And finally, I want to discuss the importance of being a leader of character. I often walk the halls of the Pentagon. And on the fourth floor outside the Department of the Air Force, there's a series of paintings depicting the resolve of American airmen who were held as prisoners of war in North Vietnam. I know some of those men."
" They serve as reminders of the character and resolve at the core of our mission. As you walk around campus, you, too, have similar reminders. Walk by Sijan Hall or the statue of General Risner, or the Plaza of Heroes, and you're reminded of what you are part of and what you contribute to. "
"Character is a lesson you have to constantly learn - you're never done - And teach throughout your career. So hold onto these reminders. Find new ones. You'll find the words of George Washington you memorized as fourth-class cadet, remember that? ""It is actions,"" he said, ""not the commission that make the officer."" And that there is more expected from him than his title. That will have greater meaning to you as your careers go on. "
"We're a great nation with great responsibilities. As we meet these responsibilities, our nation stands on the foundation of character that both you and this institution make stronger and stand for, and show to the rest of the world.  As you embark on your career of lives of service, know that your country is 100 percent behind you. I'm 1,000 percent behind you. I'm so proud of you."
"We know what you're putting into this, and we know what you're able to achieve. You're doing the noblest thing you can do, and I'm exceedingly proud of you."
 Thanks.
"Good afternoon, everyone.  Thank you so much for being here and…to join me in what is a great privilege – and that is to honor Senators Carl Levin and John Warner today.  And also, I want to welcome Carl’s wife Barbara, his brother Congressman Sandy – where is…where’d Sandy go?  Ah, thank you, I know you have to leave early and tend to business on the Hill.  Budget business, I assume – budget business is good.  John’s wife Jeanne – Jeanne, thank you for being here.  John’s son John, his aptly named daughter Virginia, and his brother Charles – all to the Pentagon, thank you.  And I’m very glad to be joined by Jim Clapper, DoD leaders and Congressional leaders past and present, and so many long-time friends of all of us."
"We’re here today to honor two extraordinary senators and statesmen.  Now, Carl himself has called these two friends an “odd couple,” but what makes Carl and John different pales in comparison to all they share, including their uncompromising dedication to our nation’s defense and our men and women in uniform.  "
"For that commitment, for their leadership on the Senate Armed Service Committee, and for their continued support for DoD, we’re dedicating today the Levin-Warner Legislative Affairs Suite to them.  "
"And we’re also giving John our highest award, the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service.  Now, I’d liked to have awarded Carl that as well at the same time, but he’s so deserving he received that award a few years ago.  But John, as worthy as you and your service are, I was surprised you haven’t received it yet, but now, I’m honored to give you something that you so richly deserve."
"Now, it might seem odd to some of you that a Secretary of Defense would choose to honor two former members of Congress in this way.  But it shouldn’t seem strange – it shouldn’t seem strange.  And that’s because our defense is so vital that we must shepherd it from strategic era to strategic era, from administration to administration, from congress to congress, across parties, and across our government.  "
"And we have to do that together – following the example set by John and Carl.  They’re a model for bipartisan leadership on national defense and for partnership between branches of government.  They demonstrate an unwavering dedication to our personnel in uniform, on the battlefield and here at home.  And they are examples of civility in public debate and discourse. "
"That last one is particularly important.  That’s because our troops need to be able to look up to their leaders here in Washington and see strength and consistency and respect, as well as a loyalty to – and caring for – them and our country’s future.  And they could always look up and see the two of you. "
The American people also need to be able to look to Congress and the Pentagon and be confident in the institutions dedicated to our national security.  And our friends and allies around the world need to see in Washington a commitment to the strength and to the principles that the United States has long represented.  And our foes need to see power and determination. 
"Through their example and their leadership, Carl and John ushered us out of the Cold War and helped us address the opportunities and challenges of the post-9/11 world.  They also ably represented their states’ needs while considering the broader interests of our nation and our military."
"And that’s not always easy, but they took the long view when ensuring our nation’s defense.  And they appreciated how today’s challenges fall into the long arc of our nation’s history, and that there’s much to be gained by considering history’s lessons when developing today’s policies…and planning for our future."
"Their example is important today as the Defense Department today, right now, right here faces a new strategic era with no fewer than five major, immediate, and evolving challenges: countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe; managing historic change in the vital Asia-Pacific region; strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea’s nuclear and missile provocations; checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Gulf; and accelerating the certain defeat of ISIL in its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria and everywhere it might metastasize around the world. "
"As we confront these five challenges, I’m grateful – and we should all be grateful – that ours is the finest fighting force the world has ever known.  There’s no one stronger, there’s no one more capable…because our military edge is second-to-none.  That’s a fact that every American ought to be proud of, and a fact that every American should thank statesmen like Carl and John for.  In their years on the Senate Armed Services Committee, they sharpened our military edge and helped us stay ahead of our adversaries – ensuring that we were not only ready to address current threats and challenges, but also poised for future success.  "
"They did so because they wanted the best for our men and women in uniform.  They did so because they believed in our mission.  And they did so because they understood that no – no matter what tomorrow brings, the world will require sustained American leadership. And while we don’t get to choose the challenges we face today, we can prepare for tomorrow by setting a strategic course, establishing defense priorities, and making the right investments."
"Doing so requires cooperation and coordination across the government, but in particular, it requires a partnership between Congress and the DoD – and strong partnerships within Congress itself.  "
"Time and again, Carl and John were those kinds of partners, on smart and collaborative reform, with their measured and responsible oversight, and on the NDAA, which they helped pass on a bipartisan basis for over three decades and were matched – which were matched by corresponding appropriations.  As partners, as SASC chairmen, and as individual senators they helped make our department a better department and our military stronger. "
"For his part, Carl was called “Mr. Integrity” when he was in the Senate.  Over his 36 years in the Capitol, he made a mark on domestic and foreign policy, but he’s best known in this building for his years on the Senate Armed Services Committee.  One Senator said of his leadership there, “Why can’t the rest of the Senate work the way the Armed Services Committee works?” He answered, the Senate – …that individual answered his own question and said that the Senate doesn’t have “enough Carl Levins.”"
"Explaining why – on Carl’s retirement in 2014 – the SASC never let disagreements stop it from doing its business, current Chairman John McCain said simply, “Carl won’t let us.”  Indeed, every day he served, he always put our country – and our troops – first…right up until his last day in office.  He was even late to his own retirement party – I understand – because he was busy managing the NDAA on the Senate floor."
"A few years ago, Carl told some public policy students back home in his beloved state Michigan, that even “if issues change,” he said, “principles do not.”  Time and again, when the nation and DoD faced a new challenge, Carl was there…doing his homework, getting ground truth from war zones, providing the patience and persistence needed for principled oversight.  "
"As threats changed, Carl became a leading voice on counterterrorism.  As our missions changed and as technology, industry, and innovation evolved, Carl advocated for acquisition reform that benefited both our warfighters and our taxpayers.  And as times and the fights changed, Carl was always a tireless guardian for our troops and veterans, supporting their needs on and off the battlefield – repealing “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” passing the Wounded Warrior Act, and getting body armor to troops in Iraq. "
"Carl, for all this, your SASC leadership, your dogged work for our people, and your personal friendship, we honor you, and we thank you.  "
"And you had a good partner in John Warner.  As a member of the Greatest Generation and a native of Virginia, a state that has given our nation so many great leaders, Senator John Warner knows what it means to be a public servant: he served his country – in uniform, at the Pentagon, or on Capitol Hill – through every single conflict since World War II."
"During World War II, he enlisted as young sailor.  When the war in Korea broke out, he left law school to fight bravely as a Marine Corps officer.  During the Vietnam War, he led the Department of the Navy – first as an Undersecretary and later as Secretary.  "
"And from the Cold War to the first Gulf War to the Balkans and on to Iraq and Afghanistan, John served as a leading member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, including several years as chairman.  "
"On his time as chairman, John said, he saw his first responsibility as “towards my nation, not politics and particularly [to] the men and women of the armed forces and their families.”  That was clear in all he helped get done for our people and for our great institution.  "
"Thanks to his leadership, our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines – and their families – can rely on TRICARE, the Goldwater-Nichols Act helped reform how our organization works, and the GI Bill was enhanced.  And he was an earlier – early champion for nuclear stability and safety, including the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, as the Cold War was coming to an end."
"Now, John may not remember this, but he and some of his colleagues invited me, who was a relative nobody in nuclear physics at that time, to a trip with them related to their work.  It was a fascinating time in history, but what I remember most in those years – many years ago now – is how John treated me and everyone around him.  "
"He was encouraging and respectful to me, a complete novice, and he was as respectful of me as he was of some of the national and international leaders with whom we met.   "
"That meant a great deal to one young person who was interested in public service, but it’s also a lesson that’s stayed with me throughout my career.  Some of the most important and profound connections we make in these positions happen far from the committee rooms and the Sunday shows, the bilateral meetings and the public eye.  Those moments of inspiration, John, usually only occur when one person is paying attention."
"John, as one person you inspired long ago and on behalf of the many others whom you have inspired then and inspire today, it’s my great honor to present the Distinguished Public Service Award to you today, which we’ll do in just a moment.  On behalf of the men and women of the Department of Defense, and on behalf of a grateful nation, thank you, John.  Both in and out of uniform, you’ve dedicated your career – and your life – to serving this great nation. "
"Now, in addition to honoring John and Carl’s remarkable careers, we’re also honoring the enduring friendship and partnership of these two men.  They traveled together, they talked together, and they passed the gavel to one another.  As they did so, they developed the trust and respect necessary to put the nation’s defense and our servicemembers’ welfare ahead of, as John has said, “all other considerations.” "
"That’s why we’re naming the Pentagon’s legislative affairs suite after both of you and your partnership – a fitting tribute to two individuals who are examples for how we must work together – not only across the aisle but across the river to ensure the Defense Department and America’s military edge are not only ready to address current threats and challenges, but also positioned for success in the future.  "
"That’s what John and Carl did, regardless of the strategic era, regardless of the party in the majority, regardless of the politics of the day.  You can see that in footage from hearing after hearing, you can see that in all the miles they traveled together, and you can see that in the pages and pages of law these two have authored and passed. "
"And you can also see that in a simple, yet powerful press conference just 15 years ago – almost to the day.  On September 11th, 2001 – a tragic day for sure in our nation’s history, and a particularly dark hour in the history of this very building and this department – they came here to the Pentagon.  They toured the damage, they comforted many, and they met with leaders here.  And they stood with Defense Secretary Don Rumsfeld and Chairman Hugh Shelton in a Pentagon press conference to reassure the American people. And in that press conference Carl said, and I quote, “Our institutions are strong, and our unity is palpable.”"
John and Carl were two reasons why that was true on 9/11 and in the years since.  And with their names on the door – and their example front of mind – DoD’s legislative affairs team and senior leaders for years to come will work with our partners in Congress to ensure it remains true – and our military edge remains honed – in all the years ahead for this proud nation.
"Now we went by the newly named suite just a few moments ago – and I encourage you all to go there and look at some of the wonderful photographs now on display.  For now, though, we’re going to unveil a photo of the suite – right here – honoring these two distinguished servants. "
"Once again, thank you, and congratulations, guys."
"Good morning, everyone."
"Just take a look out there, how magnificent you look."
How proud we are of you.
"And ladies and gentlemen, Excellencies who are here, Chairman Dunford, members of the EUCOM and NATO team, friends, family, it's a privilege to be with you as we pass this vital command between two of our military's most distinguished and accomplished leaders:"
"General Philip Breedlove, General Curtis Scaparrotti."
"I have plenty to say about the character and the contributions of these two extraordinary generals.  Before I do, I want speak directly to you, the men and women of EUCOM, about the work you do every day and the challenges that we face together.  I'm proud of you for what you do to strengthen our partnerships with some of our most important allies and friends, and to confront a new generation of high-end threats to the security of this continent.  "
"You are doing the noblest thing that one can do, dedicating your lives to the security of your country, the security of others, making a better world for our children."
"And whether on the ground in the Balkans, or the skies over the Baltic, afloat on a Black Sea, helping deliver ISIL a lasting defeat, or enabling NATO's Resolute Support mission in Afghanistan.  You’re advancing a proud and distinguished tradition, here.  And working shoulder to shoulder with many of our oldest and closest friends, you are helping to strengthen one of history's strongest and most capable alliances.  "
"And for nearly seven decades, the guarantor of prosperity and stability on this continent has been the NATO alliance.  For generations, our member nations have stood for enduring principles, including the peaceful resolution of disputes, non-aggression and the spread of freedom and democracy.  We've helped ensure that countries can make their own security and economic choices, free from coercion or intimidation.  We've also help ensure that the door to the Euro-Atlantic integration remains open, so that countries that take on the challenge of building democratic institutions, making tough reforms, strengthening the rule of law also have a chance to join the Alliance."
"NATO has been so effective in doing so, because we share common values, reflected in the way we conduct ourselves.  We know what each other stands for, how we do things and why.  We treat each other as equals, and we take each other's interests into account.  It's clear that we do things better when we do them together.  "
"The strategic environment in Europe has changed dramatically to the end of World War II, to the end of the Cold War, to complex challenges Europe faces today from the east and the south.  This requires changing how we do things, even as we seek to protect and achieve what remains the same.  The 20th century NATO playbook that helped create a Europe whole, free and at peace was effective in its time.  But it's not a perfect match for the 21st-century challenges we face.  And that's why, under General Breedlove's leadership, NATO forces have been writing a new playbook.  They've been innovating to counter new challenges like cyber and hybrid warfare, integrating conventional and nuclear deterrence, and adjusting our posture and presence so that we can be more agile in responding to new threats."
"We and our allies are working together to develop answers to important questions, like how can we keep our posture and region resilient and effective in the face of fast-moving, technological changes and challenges?  How can we better integrate and distribute our capabilities and maneuvers across functions and in every domain to deter, and if necessary, defend against a high end aggression?  How can we do more to train like we'd fight to stay prepared for even the most high threat scenarios?  And what's the best way to leverage our unique strengths and global influence in order to de-escalate a crisis?"
"The NATO force that General Breedlove leaves behind is stronger than the one he inherited, as our allies recognized the need to continue investing and modernizing their capabilities, not only respond to current challenges, but stay ahead of potential, future threats.  Our nation's pledge to the 2014 Wales Summit, to spend at least 2 percent of GDP on defense and 20 percent on capital investments.  And I want to thank those nations that have met or will meet these critical benchmarks.  In our defense budgets, in our planning and in our capabilities and in our actions, we must demonstrate to potential foes that if they start a war, we have the capabilities and capacity to ensure that they regret it, because for a force to deter a conflict, it must show that it can dominate a conflict."
"And we haven't had to prioritize deterrence on NATO's eastern flank for the past 25 years.  While I wish it were otherwise, now we have to.  Despite the progress that we've made together since the end of the Cold War, Russia has in recent years appeared intent to erode the principled, international order that has served us, our friends and allies, the international community and Russia itself so well for so long."
"Russia continues to violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova, and actively seeks to intimidate its Baltic neighbors.  At sea, in the air and space and cyberspace, Russian actors have engaged in challenging international norms.  And most disturbing, Moscow's nuclear saber-rattling raises troubling questions about Russia's leader's commitments to strategic stability, their respect for norms against the use of nuclear weapons, and whether they respect the profound caution that nuclear-age leaders showed with regard to the brandishing of nuclear weapons."
"In response, the United States is taking a strong and balanced approach to address Russia's aggression.  We are strengthening our capabilities, our posture, our investments, our plans and our allies and partners, all without closing the door to working with Russia, where our interests align.  And we will continue to make clear that Russia's aggressive actions only serve to further its isolation and unite our alliance."
"Since Russia began its illegal attempted annexation of Crimea a little over two years ago, the United States has made valuable investments in reinforcing our NATO allies.  For example, we're contributing to NATO's Very High Readiness Joint Task Force, and stepping up our training and exercises under Operation Atlantic Resolve.  Our recent budget submission builds on that significantly, investing in the work you do here at EUCOM in breaking new ground by re-envisioning and recommitting to deterrence –  and if deterrence fails, defeating – any aggression against our allies in the future."
"To further reinforce our NATO allies and build our deterrence posture in the face of Russia's aggression, this budget significantly increases funding for our European Reassurance Initiative, making a total investment of $3.4 billion for this year, fiscal year 2017, which more than quadruples the amount we requested last year.  This will allow us to increase the amount of war fighting equipment, as well as the number of U.S. forces, including Reserve forces, rotating through Europe to engage with friends and allies."
"This increased support's heel-to-toe rotations that maintain the persistent presence of an armored brigade combat team, which will give us a total of three brigade combat teams continuously present in Europe.  It supports more training and exercises with our European allies and friends.  It supports more war fighting gear, including forward stationing equipment for an additional armored brigade combat team by the end of 2017."
"It also supports prepositioning equipment for a division headquarters and other enablers in Europe, such as this equipment – and along with assigned Army Airborne, and Stryker Brigade Combat Teams, and Marine Corps. heavy vehicles and equipment already in Europe – all that will allow us to rapidly form a highly capable, combined armed grounds force of division plus strength that can respond theater-wide if necessary.  And it helps strengthen our regional air superiority posture – among other things, allowing us to keep an additional F-15C Tactical Fighter Squadron based in Europe, and also improve airfield infrastructure to enhance operations for Air Force fighters and Navy maritime patrol aircraft – all this to reinforce our enduring commitment to the security of our European partners."
"Our budget also reflects our doing more in more ways with specific NATO allies.  Given increased Russian submarine activity in the North Atlantic, it includes building towards a continuous arc of highly-capable maritime patrol aircraft operating over the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom gap.  It's Norway's North Cape.  It also includes the delivery of Europe's first stealthy F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft to our British allies.  And given Russia's use of hybrid warfare – exemplified by the so-called ‘little green men’ in Ukraine – we're investing in more rotational presence of U.S. Special Operations Forces, exercising and training here in Europe."
"And as we look to address the threats of the future as well as today, we're making significant investment in important new technologies.  And when coupled with revised operational concepts, these technologies will ensure that we can deter, and if necessary, win a high-end conventional fight in an anti-access area denial environment across all domains and war fighting areas – air, land, sea, space, cyberspace and the electromagnetic spectrum.  These include new unmanned systems, enhanced ground-based air and missile defenses, new long-ranged anti-ship weapons, the long-range strike bomber and also innovation in technologies like the electromagnetic railgun, lasers and new systems for electronic warfare, space and cyberspace.  Finally, our budget also invests in modernizing our nuclear deterrent.  With these commitments, we will continue to build on our capability to deter a potential adversary like Russia."
"But the United States will also continue to hold out the possibility that Russia will assume the role of a constructive partner moving forward, not isolated and going backward in time as it appears to be doing today.  Much of the progress we've made together since the end of the Cold War we accomplished with Russia.  Let me repeat that.  Not in spite of Russia, not against Russia, not without Russia, but with it.  Russia worked toward the future before.  I know that personally.  "
"For 1995, for example, I worked with the Russian minister of defense to create an agreement on how Russia could work with NATO in bringing peace to Bosnia.  I also worked in a very practical and successful manner with Russian defense officials to help limit the dangers of nuclear proliferation in the former Soviet space.  And more recently, as the logistician for the international effort in Afghanistan, I was the beneficiary of a Russia-hosted NATO supply route into Afghanistan.  So for the United States, as we stand strong with allies and friends, we'll also continue to reach out when and where our and Russia's interests align.  And Russia can perceive that as well, such as the recent nuclear agreement with Iran, the P5+1 talks on North Korea and some other issues."
"People in the United States, here in Europe, and it should be clear in Russia, have all benefited from those moments of collaboration and progress.  So, that's why we'll keep the door open for Russian, but it's up to the Kremlin to decide.  We don't seek a cold, let alone a hot war with Russia.  We don't seek to make Russia an enemy.  But make no mistake, we will defend our allies, the rule-based international order and the positive future it affords us."
"And you, the men and women of EUCOM, will continue to play a critical role during this period of challenge and change, answering our country's call to defend our interests, our allies, the principled global order and the positive future it affords us all.  And you've performed magnificently under the command of one of the principled and visionary leaders we celebrate today, General Philip Breedlove.  "
"It was my great honor as Deputy Secretary to preside over the ceremony right here in Stuttgart three years ago, when General Breedlove assumed responsibility for this critical command.  For my work with Phil during his time as Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force, I had every confidence then that he was the right pick for the job."
"Now I need to tell you my favorite Phil Breedlove story.  And it goes like this – one day I was sitting in my office and my daughter called me from college, and she said, ""Hey, Dad, do you know General Phil Breedlove?""  I said, ""Yeah, honey, I do.""  And she said, ""Well, he just gave the most amazing talk on leadership to us here.""  I said, ""Well, I'm not surprised to hear that.""  And she said, ""Do you get to meet with General Breedlove?"""
"And I said, ""Well, you know, honey, if he has time for me, I get to meet with him."""
"I knew General Breedlove was a figure who would lead EUCOM with the highest standards of professionalism, and a leader who could adapt and respond and innovate and command effectively to a changing environment.  And certainly, much has changed since General Breedlove assumed command of EUCOM and became Supreme Allied Commander.  He has been the first to show the way to responding to that change.  But what hasn't changed is the nature of Phil's strong, and steady and principled leadership.  "
"During his tenure as EUCOM Commander, General Breedlove has drawn not only from all he has achieved as a senior officer, but from his years in Europe as a young American pilot.  From his service on this continent during some of those perilous days of the Cold War, he deeply appreciates how times of great challenge demand closer and stronger partnerships.  He knows what it means to prepare and train each day to fly, to fight and to win alongside NATO counterparts."
"And one of his most cherished memories over these past three years came during the 75th anniversary commemorations of D-Day, Carentan, a town in Normandy where allied forces established their first continuous line of defense.  The commemorations left a profound impression, especially as an American veteran of the invasion walked with General Breedlove for the final steps of the parade.  General Breedlove remarked that before that event he thought he had known – understood – the significance of D-Day.  But as he walked in the parade passing fields where so many have given their last full measure of devotion, and crossing the road now named Purple Heart Lane, he reflected upon what D-Day means to us as Americans and to our European brethren.  He said, ""We honor the sacrifices and memory of those who have gone before us, by recognizing how far we have come as a community and by continuing to move forward together, striving for a Europe, whole, free and at peace."""
"Phil, you not only honored that commitment, you've dedicated your life to carrying it forward.  But you and your wife Cindy, have been shining examples to our allies of all that is good and decent about the American military.  And Cindy, we are all grateful.  And that includes Stephanie and myself, for your tireless dedication to the welfare of our troops.  You and Phil are truly a wonderful team.  And for your selfless service and leadership, on behalf of the Department of Defense and a grateful nation, you too have our deepest appreciation.  Thank you."
"And as Phil and Cindy transition from this command, they can do so knowing that the men and women of EUCOM are in the good hand of another principled leader, who also had the good sense to marry a remarkable woman named Cindy."
"General Curtis Scaparrotti, or “SCAP” as we all know him.  I recommended Scap to the President for this critical command for three central reasons.  And he easily approved that recommendation for those same reasons. "
"First, Scap has a proven track record to performance under pressure and in environments of significant complexity and uncertainty.  Whether leading troops in the Balkans during a contentious and fragile moment in history; or in Afghanistan, where he led ISAF's joint command and 140,000 NATO troops; or most recently, as Commander of Combined Forces Command on the Korean Peninsula – a place where ""fight tonight"" is not just a slogan, but an ever present possibility.  Scap knows the practicalities of land and joint combat.  He has been a tower of strength and deterrence, continually preparing his troops for evolving threats.  And I have no doubt these skills will serve him well here in this environment, where preparedness and adaptiveness are going to be so critical."
"Second, as his success with our Korean and Coalition partners has demonstrated, Scap is one of the most skillful and accomplished warrior-diplomats.  He knows how to build solidarity with our allies.  He has experience leading and enabling joint command and allied forces.  And he knows how to prevent provocations from escalating."
"And third, Scap's innovative approach to difficult challenges.  Like Phil, he has an ability to think differently to address complex situations.  For example on the Korean Peninsula, Phil showed creative thinking and developing a conditions-based approach that established the lines of command and control in a crisis.  I'm confident he will bring this kind of creative thinking to similar challenges here in Europe."
"From Scap's first days as a soldier, he has recognized the awesome responsibilities of command.  These are lessons he began to appreciate even before he arrived at West Point, truths modeled for him by his father, who served in the Second World War as a noncommissioned officer and for decades as a reservist.  "
"And as an officer, he has understood personally where so much of our strength lies, in an NCO corps that's well-trained, and trusted and empowered.  Certainly, Scap has always been a soldier's soldier.  But in his leadership, and example, he has proven that he remains a soldier's general.  "
"In his hometown of Logan, Ohio, there's a bridge over the new river, named for both Scap and his father.  And it's a fitting tribute.  General Scaparrotti's success has come from his ability to build bridges – between Allies and partners, between diverse elements within our joint force, between the pride we take in our past and the security imperatives of the future."
" today as we mark this change of command, we build another bridge between the leadership of two proven statesmen, two Joint-Force warriors, two coalition builders.  And as we mark a change in command, we also celebrate a remarkable continuity. While these two men have lead in different domains and different theaters, they both understand the powerful responsibility of asking young people like those from this command before me for me to enter extreme danger to accomplish a vital mission.  These are two leaders who appreciate deeply the weight of all we ask our troops and their families to carry.  "
"We cannot predict precisely how or when the men and women of EUCOM will be called to carry forward their mission in the months and years to come.  But we do know this.  We know that General Scaparrotti will lead this team with certainty, clarity and with our total trust and confidence.  And we know that the force General Scaparrotti inherits is ready to execute its vital responsibilities, thanks to General Breedlove's visionary leadership and unyielding commitment to our force."
"So to General Scaparrotti, to General Breedlove, to their families, to all the men and women who have served under their strong and steady leadership to face the challenges of a complex world, thank you."
"FOREIGN MINISTER BISHOP: Good afternoon. On behalf of the Minister for Defense Senator Marise Payne, I would like to say how delighted we’ve been to host U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis for our annual AUSMIN meeting, the Australian-U.S. Ministerial consultations, here in Sydney. "
This is a very important opportunity for Australia and the United States to share perspectives and insights and discuss strategies and ideas and ways in which we can continue to cooperate and work together to promote peace and stability and security in our region and globally. 
"We are the strongest of friends and allies. We have a shared military history going back 100 years, and today, we work as closely as two nations can operate in terms of promoting peace and stability and security."
"We meet just days after the shocking terrorist attacks in London, and we stand resolute in our determination to fight terrorism and to fight the poisonous ideology that gives rise to these brutal attacks so often on innocent civilians. We discussed the issue of counterterrorism activities given that we’re seeing strains of Islamic terrorism in our region. The ongoing conflict in the southern Philippines, in Mindanao, is a matter of deep concern. "
"We also discussed our region, Southeast Asia, our relationship with countries in our region. We discussed challenges on the Korean Peninsula, in particular the destructive behavior of North Korea in its nuclear and missile weapons testing, and what we can do together and with other nations to curb this behavior and the risk that it poses, not only regionally but globally. "
"We discussed regional cooperation in areas of maritime disputes, notably the South China Sea, and we urge all nations to resolve their disputes peacefully and in accordance with the international rules-based order. We had a very productive discussion on the Pacific and how we can work more closely together in the Pacific – our neighborhood, our part of the world. "
"In discussing operations and policies and strategies further afield, we focused on joint efforts in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and Syria, where we are determined to restore peace and stability to the Middle East and rid the world of the terrorist scourge that it has presented and is evolving. "
"We took the opportunity to discuss a whole range of issues where the United States and Australia have a similar view. In fact, we are like-minded in our worldview. We share values, interests, priorities, and outlooks, and this AUSMIN has reaffirmed once more the strength of the bilateral relationship between Australia and the United States. "
"Secretary Tillerson and I also had the opportunity to discuss bilateral issues on trade, on investment, and other areas where Australia-U.S. interests coincide. "
"So all in all, it was a very productive, useful, important discussion between counterparts, between friends, and we look forward to going to the United States in 2018 for the next AUSMIN meeting. In the meantime, we’ll continue to work with our counterparts. Rex and Jim have become good friends we’ve met on a number of occasions now, and Marise and I look forward to deepening and strengthening this already extraordinary partnership."
"Secretary Tillerson, (inaudible). "
"SECRETARY TILLERSON: Thank you, Julie, and good afternoon, everyone. And let me begin, of course, by thanking Foreign Minister Bishop and Defense Minister Payne for their hospitality and for hosting this session of AUSMIN. Minister Bishop was one of my first counterparts that I met with when she traveled to Washington, and that began a very, very productive dialogue that has continued certainly through today. Secretary Mattis and I obviously look forward to having dinner this evening with Prime Minister Turnbull, and we know we’re going to have a very fruitful exchange in that sense as well. "
"We had very productive meetings today, as Foreign Minister Bishop described to you. We covered a broad range of topics that are important to both of us, obviously clear that our longstanding friendship with Australia will continue to remain strong. "
"Our shared values of freedom, democracy, a rules-based order, are long bonds that have been formed in the sacrifices that we have made together over the past century through two world wars, and continue to stand shoulder to shoulder in upholding these values of freedom and democracy and a rules-based order evident today in our joint efforts in this fight against terrorism. "
"Today, we also speak with one voice in calling for North Korea to abandon its illegal nuclear weapons program. China and other regional partners should also step up their efforts to help solve this security situation which threatens not just that region but really presents a threat to the entire world. "
"The U.S. and Australia also reaffirmed our commitment to freedom of navigation and overflight and other lawful uses of the seas, particularly the South China Sea and elsewhere, to ensure unimpeded flow of lawful commerce and a rules-based order. We oppose China’s artificial island construction and their militarization of features in international waters. "
"China is a significant economic and trading power, and we desire a productive relationship, but we cannot allow China to use its economic power to buy its way out of other problems, whether it’s militarizing islands in the South China Sea or failure to put appropriate pressure on North Korea. They must recognize that with a role as a growing economic and trading power comes security responsibilities as well. "
"Australia and the U.S. will work together to support democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human rights, and that includes defending the rules-based order which the Asia Pacific region depends upon. "
"We are certainly grateful for Australia’s commitment to defeating ISIS in Iraq and Syria, wherever else they may show their face, and certainly their face is appearing in the region. Countering violent extremism, stemming the flow of foreign terrorist fighters, and shutting down propaganda arms online remains a shared goal for both the United States and Australia. "
"We reaffirm the strong state of bilateral defense, security, and intelligence cooperation under our alliance, as well as the strength of our bilateral security relationships with Japan, and our commitment to enhancing that trilateral cooperation. I’ll leave it to Secretary Mattis to tell you more about these discussions. "
"We also share with Australia a keen interest in ensuring our economic policies advance prosperity at home as well as abroad. Australian companies employ almost 100,000 Americans, and American companies in Australia employ about 335,000 Australians. Good trade policies mean good jobs for both of our peoples."
"On behalf the United States, I’m grateful to the government and the people of Australia for hosting our delegation and for a spirit of cooperation that’s benefited both of our nations, and has for decades, and will continue in the future, and as Foreign Minister Bishop said, we look forward to continuing the dialogues among our staffs while we make our way to next year’s AUSMIN in Washington, D.C. "
"So again, thank you, and I’ll turn it to Senator Payne. "
"DEFENSE MINISTER PAYNE: Thank you very much, Rex, Julie, Jim, ladies and gentlemen, and I want to begin by thanking their excellencies the governor and Mrs. Hurley for their hospitality and enabling us to have this AUSMIN meeting here in the beautiful government house in Sydney. "
"I’d like to also join Minister Bishop in thanking both Jim and Rex for an excellent day of discussions here for AUSMIN 2017. Jim and I, in fact, have been hanging out all weekend at Shangri-La, in Singapore, where we met with our key regional counterparts, an excellent preparation, if I might say, for some of the discussions we had here today about our engagement in the Indo-Pacific."
"What today’s meeting has again underscored is the strength and the breadth of our unique relationship. As my colleagues have indicated, we covered a very wide range of topics, including North Korea, the Middle East, and other matters of global strategic importance, through to the very tactical aspects of how Australia and the United States as defense partners particularly can work together to achieve our common goals both globally and in the region. "
"In particular, we have reaffirmed our joint commitment to the force posture initiatives in Northern Australia as a tangible contribution to the stability, the security, and the prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region. We look forward to continuing to work together on the development of those force posture initiatives, and indeed, to engaging with a number of our regional neighbors in that context. "
"As I said, both at the Shangri-La Dialogue which Secretary Mattis and I attended on the weekend and also here today, countering the threat of violent extremism is very much at the front of our minds. The attacks that have occurred in recent days and weeks around the world are further reminders – as if that were needed – of the new reality in which we live. And during today’s AUSMIN meeting, we strengthened our resolve to defeat those who wish us harm. "
"We are both committed to defeating Daesh in Iraq and in Syria and to preventing its spread around the world, including in the Indo-Pacific region. For us, that means addressing the prospects of returning foreign fighters, if that happens, and also in the Australian context, our whole-of-government actions to deal with broader counterterrorism issues. "
"As Secretary Tillerson has said, we reaffirmed our condemnation of North Korea’s ongoing provocations, which pose a grave threat to both global and regional security. We are committed to working very closely together with – together and with our regional partners, to impose greater costs on the regime for that destabilizing behavior. "
"This AUSMIN meeting has been a great opportunity to build upon our already close working relationship with the new U.S. administration. We have met in other international locations, in the United States, and I really want to thank both Secretary Mattis and Secretary Tillerson for traveling to Sydney to join us here today, and we look forward to continuing productive discussions. "
"SECRETARY MATTIS: Well, thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, as you’ve already heard, we stand here before you representing the strongest possible military alliance. This is one that has stood together through thick and thin and through generations, and I would just say that Australia has also proven to be a friend that tells us what we need to hear, not necessarily what we want to hear. And it was heartening today to find that we again share an appreciation of the security situation both regionally and worldwide. "
"The danger that we have faced over many, many years has built a sense of respect between our forces. I would remind you that after 9/11, when thousands of innocent people were murdered in America, including Australians, it was the Australians that were first to join us in the desert of Afghanistan in those uncertain days after 9/11, and we remain grateful for Australia’s alliance with us. Today, we still stand together in that fight, and certainly, our sympathies, our respects are with the people of London; of Marawi, Philippines; of Kabul, Afghanistan; of Cairo, Egypt – the list goes on – Jakarta. And we stand together. We do not allow ourselves to be intimidated at all. Australia, as always, punching above its weight in defense of our values and freedom, and these are values and freedoms that we intend to pass on to the next generation intact, and we are committed again today to assessing how we’re going to work together to do so."
"I would add that your 2016 defense white paper, we have reviewed it in Washington and it’s a model for other nations coming to grips with today’s security challenges, and I am confident that it’s a blueprint for keeping the Australian forces at the top of their game."
"We believe that our Australian-American partnership is a foundation for stability and peace not only in this region, but more broadly, and we are going to ensure between our forces that our diplomats’ voices are always backed up by skillful, by ethical, and by fierce force of arms. "
"Thank you very much, and we look forward to your questions. "
MODERATOR: David Wroe. 
"QUESTION: Thanks, everyone. David Wroe from the The Age and Sydney Morning Herald newspapers. Secretary Mattis, you have flagged a new – a different strategy, a different tactic, I should say, in the fight against ISIS: one of annihilation, which, among other things, is aimed at preventing the escape and return of foreign fighters. I just wonder if you could talk through for us what the practical endpoint of that tactic is. Are we talking about going into these areas and systematically killing people who may pose a future threat? What happens if that involves a greater risk to civilian casualties or some other unforeseen outcome which would complicate your military tactics? We’ve always been told that you can’t bomb an ideology into submission. Are you concerned at all that by focusing on individuals, you might inadvertently strengthen the ideology? "
"And just for the Australian side, could you tell us please, either Minister Bishop or Payne, what Australia’s view of this new tactic is? What does it mean for our involvement, our military involvement in the Middle East? Does it mean we need to change our rules of engagement or are they covered by the current rules? "
"SECRETARY MATTIS: Well, the – President Trump, when he came into office, wanted an accelerated campaign against the enemy. This is an enemy against all civilization. It’s the reason there are 66 nations that have joined the campaign besides the Arab League, the European Union, Interpol, and NATO, and in this campaign where before we were shoving them from one town to another and just falling back, we now take the time to invest now and to make certain that foreign fighters cannot escape for return to Paris, France, to Australia, to wherever they came from, and bring their message of hatred and their skills back to those places and attack innocent people."
"But I would also add that in the midst of all this, we have changed not one bit of our rules of engagement. We have relented not one bit in terms of trying to do everything humanly possible to protect the innocent on the battlefield, because the battlefield the way the enemy has chosen to fight is also a humanitarian field from our point of view, and it is indeed ISIS that forces innocent people to stay where they choose to fortify. "
"So our intent is to do everything possible to keep them alive, to protect them, but at the same time we’re going to have to take that caliphate down or the attacks that you’ve seen going on around the world that you all have reported on will continue. This is not the end state. The end state is where we work together for a reconciliation, for what the diplomats will have to do, but clearly, the enemy has got to be taken out by military means where they are powerful enough to cause these attacks on others, and we can’t sit idly by and let them hold it. "
I think that answers your question. 
"FOREIGN MINISTER BISHOP: The Australian Government has made it clear that any Australian citizen that supports in any way terrorist organizations such as ISIS or al-Qaida or any of their franchises is breaking Australian law, and if they seek to travel to conflict zones in the Middle East, in Iraq and Syria, then not only are they breaking Australian laws but putting their own lives at risk as well as adding to the misery and suffering of the people of Iraq and Syria. "
"We have (inaudible) forces supporting, advising, assisting Iraqi Security Forces and others, and they are essentially fighting against the coalition if they continue to support terrorism. Should they survive and seek to return to Australia, they will be monitored, they will be tracked, and they will be subjected to the Australian laws should they return to Australia. And I’d ask Senator Payne to add to that. "
"DEFENSE MINISTER PAYNE: Thank you very much, and (inaudible), thank you for the question. We absolutely support the approach that the international coalition led by the United States is taking. Our absolute preference is, as far as possible, to make sure that those who have left their countries to fight in the name of Daesh or ISIS in the Middle East are not able to return to those countries and perpetrate any of their atrocities in those areas. "
"So as far as possible, if we can ensure that, that is our preference. But we don’t – we have to be prepared to deal with the eventuality that – if those returning foreign fighters, if that arises. We would be negligent if we did not turn our attention to that, as the foreign minister has said, under Australian law, and the preparations that we have made during recent months and in fact the last year. We will use all the force of Australian law to deal with those people. "
"Importantly, however, one of the things that we have also discussed today is the challenge that is faced as to other countries in our region – for Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, for the Philippines, and so on. And in the context of that discussion, we have indicated to our counterparts both individually and over the weekend at Shangri-La that we will support them in their efforts to address the prospect of returning fighters as well. They are – we’re – you have the world’s most populous Muslim nation to our north. President Widodo and his cabinet have exemplified a sensible, moderate approach to Islamic terrorism in our neighborhood. Similarly Malaysia; similarly the Muslim communities of a number of our other – of those other countries in our region. We need to be able to engage with them in a constructive way and make sure that where possible, we insist and provide tools that enable them to challenge this threat too."
"MODERATOR: Gardiner Harris, New York Times. "
"QUESTION: Gardiner Harris from The New York Times. Secretary Tillerson, the Australians have spent years of diplomatic effort negotiating pacts to address their deep concerns over trade and climate, but the Trump administration tossed those pacts aside. Now, after rejecting their priorities and work, you’re here asking Australians to make specific and concrete sacrifices for your priorities in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, and North Korea. What specific promises have you brought on trade and climate to ensure that Australians do not interpret “America first” to mean America the selfish, America the boorish, or America the go-it-alone?"
"And for the Australians, Mr. Trump yelled at Prime Minister Turnbull in their first conversation. He pushed aside the Montenegrin prime minister at a NATO meeting. He launched a Twitter attack on Germany, one of the U.S.’s closest allies. He just insulted the mayor of London after a terror attack on that city. Do these tactics give you pause in your efforts to improve relations with the U.S., or do the President’s words and behavior not matter in international relations? "
SECRETARY TILLERSON: Are you sure you don’t have more? (Laughter.) 
QUESTION: No. 
"SECRETARY TILLERSON: Okay. The fact that the Trump administration has examined agreements that were entered into by the prior administration but never taken to the American people or taken to our Congress to get an assessment of their view of those agreements does not define the trading relationships between the United States and Australia nor other relationships on issues that are of mutual importance: climate change, certainly national security (inaudible) for us today. We have a very strong trading relationship with Australia today. I think if you look at the total of foreign direct investment by the United States in Australia, as well as our actual trade, we are the largest trading partner by those two measures with Australia. My expectation is that’s not going to change, and we look forward to continue strengthening those relationships on trade with Australia, already a very important trading partner. "
"I think the President’s decision to exit the climate accord – again, it was his judgment that that agreement did not serve the American people well and it did not serve their future economic interest. I have – but I think the President indicating his desire to reexamine, enter into discussions with others, perhaps a new construct of an agreement indicates his recognition that the issue is still important and that he wants to stay engaged on the issue. He’s not walking away from it, he’s simply walking away from what he felt was an agreement that did not serve the American people well. "
"So again, I think in our relationship with Australia we will continue to have shared interests in addressing these daunting challenges that face us all, and so that, I think, is how we see the relationship going forward, and there are so many other areas of such strong mutual interest and cooperation that there’s no doubt that we will continue to address the two issues that you raised in a very cooperative way. "
"FORIGN MINISTER BISHOP: I should point out that Australia has its own views on our priorities and our interests. As it happens, they align so often with those of the United States. We have a similar worldview. We have shared values, shared interests. But Australia always takes our own national interest into account when we, for example, respond to the terror threat that is so (inaudible) in Syria. We take our own interests into account when we’re dealing with regional threats and risks, like the behavior of North Korea. We see North Korea as a threat to our region as much as we see it as a threat globally. And we certainly are absolutely aligned with the United States in supporting the rules-based order, and we make up our own mind about when Australia should act, when Australia should be involved in defense and security operations. As it happens, the United States and Australia share similar views. "
"In relation to Twitter, I understand that it has a maximum of 140 characters. So we deal with the President, with his cabinet, and with the U.S. administration on what they do, what they achieve, what their strategies are, and how we can work together in close and deep cooperation to uphold that international rules-based order and to bring peace, stability, and prosperity to our part of the world as the United States has guaranteed and assured for the last 70 years."
"In relation to the Paris Agreement, Australia took a decision in August of 2015 that we would put forward targets in accordance with the Paris Agreement that were environmentally and economically sound for Australia, and we will continue to, I believe, meet our targets under the Paris Agreement. And again, it is a decision taken by our cabinet in the interests of our economy and our citizens. And I believe that through meeting our targets – environmentally and economically sustainable measures – we will be on the path to ensuring affordable, reliable, low-emissions energy for the Australian people. But we certainly appreciate the United States’ innovation and ingenuity that allows us to embrace the technologies and the innovative approaches the United States brings to the area of environmental and energy policy."
"MODERATOR: Greg Jennett, please. "
"QUESTION: Greg Jennett from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. I direct this primarily at the visiting secretaries, and it’s somewhat broader than Gardiner’s question. Can you explain or reconcile to Australian audiences an apparent contradiction in the administration? Your business here today is to build alliances and relationships, and at least there is an impression abroad of isolationism expressed, some would argue, through the climate change decision or even through statements made by the executive at the NATO gathering. "
"So Secretary Tillerson, do you acknowledge that there are in this region pockets of doubt about U.S. consistency, and what do you do to address them? "
"And Secretary Mattis, you do seem to have convinced the Australian prime minister at least on matters relating to the South China Sea. He made comments in Singapore about finding new sources of leadership to help the United States. So the question is what forms of leadership relating to the South China Sea do you seek from Australia? "
"SECRETARY TILLERSON: First, let me respond in terms of those concerns. That’s why we’re here. That’s why we traveled to the region and that’s why we engage with our counterparts. I’ve had two direct engagements already with members of ASEAN in Washington, D.C. We’re going to be very active in the East Asia Conference, also in APEC. The President’s already indicated he intends to participate. "
"So in terms of addressing those concerns, this is how we address it, is to travel to the region and to meet with our counterparts and to talk about all the issues that are important to them and hear from them the concerns they may have about where the administration is positioned relative to whether it be security issues or economic and trade issues. And we have had very good dialogue in all of those contacts. "
So I think – I hope – the fact that we are here demonstrates that that is certainly not this administration’s view or intention to somehow put an arm – put at arm’s length those important allies and partners in the world. 
"SECRETARY MATTIS: As far as your question to what form of leadership are we looking for from Australia, I would put it in traditional Australian terms. It’s adherence to international law. It’s the normal leadership by example that Australia has demonstrated over – really since its founding as a modern nation. It’s the sort of thing where people work together to solve problems, where we sit down and define problems and then look at what are the rules of the road, and then we abide by them. It’s a matter of finding common cause and then finding a way to address everyone’s interests in the most effective manner possible. And Australia has proven its ability to do this and be a beacon of hope for people and the world; I would add, to be a contributor to security in the region, to stability in the region, from the Solomon Islands effort a few years ago to all the other humanitarian operations that they’ve been engaged in. It’s mostly a matter of leadership by example, would be the short answer to your question. "
"MODERATOR: Bob Burns with the last question, please. "
"QUESTION: Thank you. Bob Burns, Associated Press. A question for Secretaries Tillerson and Mattis, something that’s – I’m told that today while you were here for these discussions, which is that the UAE, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt have announced they are cutting diplomatic ties with Qatar, and I wonder if you could explain what you believe are the implications of this for the fight against Islamic extremism and also for solidarity in the coalition against Iran? "
"And if I could also ask you about something that’s related to the Central Command region, to all four of you, which is Afghanistan, which you all mentioned. Secretary Tillerson, as the administration reviews its options for how to turn things around in Afghanistan, what is your view on the wisdom of committing more U.S. troops and other resources to a conflict that has been a stalemate for years? And I’d like to ask the same question of Secretary Mattis. "
"And for your Australian counterparts, you’ve said that you’re willing to contribute more troops in Afghanistan. I think you got quoted as saying perhaps 30, and I’m wondering whether you would consider going beyond that in other ways and (inaudible) in Afghanistan?"
Thank you. 
"SECRETARY TILLERSON: Well, let me just make a brief comment on the late breaking news that you just referred to in terms of diplomatic relations between GCC countries and Qatar. I think, as I understand it from what I’ve read since the actions were taken, I think what we’re witnessing is a growing list of some irritants in the region that have been there for some time, and obviously they have now bubbled up to a level that countries decided they needed to take action in an effort to have those differences addressed. We certainly would encourage the parties to sit down together and address these differences, and we – if there’s any role that we can play in terms of helping them address those, we think it is important that the GCC remain unified. I do not expect that this will have any significant impact, if any impact at all, on the unified – the unified fight against terrorism in the region or globally. All of those parties you mentioned have been quite, quite unified in the fight against terrorism and the fight against Daesh and ISIS, and have expressed that most recently in the summit in Riyadh. "
"As to the Afghanistan policy which is still under development and review, so there is no conclusion and I will leave it to Secretary Mattis to answer more directly what the military plans are for this year to stabilize Afghanistan. I think clearly, though, what we do understand is we can never allow Afghanistan to become a platform for terrorism to operate from. And so our commitment to Afghanistan is to ensure that it never becomes a safe haven for terrorists to launch attacks against the civilized world or against any other part of the world or any of their neighbors. And so this is really a question of what is the end state and how do we reach that end state, and that’s part of the policy review that is still under development so I don’t want to go further than I would say the thinking currently in the administration is, but other than to say we are committed to ensuring Afghanistan does not become that platform from which terrorist activities can be launched. And let me turn to Secretary Mattis to respond. "
QUESTION: But I was asking in your view – 
"SECRETARY MATTIS: In regards to the implications for the counter-ISIS fight, I am positive there will be no implications coming out of this dramatic situation at all, and I say that based on the commitment that each of these nations that you just referred to have made to this fight. As far as the situation vis-a-vis Iran, I believe Iran’s actions speak louder than anyone’s words, and they are going to incite the international community in that region to try to block them in the various destabilizing efforts that they are undertaking right now, from Syria, where Assad remains in power today because of Iran’s actions, to Yemen, where they have been contributing in an unhelpful way to a war that is marooning millions of people and leaving them vulnerable to starvation and health problems and violence. So I think it’s Iran’s actions that will speak most loudly, and the diplomatic situation, it will probably take some time – I don’t know how long – but it will be resolved. "
"As far as Afghanistan goes, as Secretary Tillerson said, the policy is under review, but at the same time we’re up against an enemy that knows that they cannot win at the ballot box, and you think – we have to sometimes remind ourselves of that reality. That’s why they use bombs, because ballots would ensure they never had a role to play, and based upon that foundation, that they cannot win the support, the affection, the respect of the Afghan people. We will stand by them. They’ve had a long, hard fight, and Australia has been in this one from the very beginning, and the fight goes on. But the bottom line is we’re not going to surrender civilization to people who cannot win at the ballot box. "
QUESTION: Thank you. 
"DEFENSE MINISTER PAYNE: Thank you. Thank you very much for that. I think Jim put that particularly well, if I might say, at the end there. Australia does currently have 270 personnel both in (inaudible) and the NATO mission, and Australia is particularly a (inaudible) of the Australian – Afghan national officer academy, and that is from our perspective the continuing – continuation of our longest contribution to any military campaign in Australia’s history. So we regard it as a very significant one, and I want to acknowledge and pay tribute to the Australian men and women of the ADF who are in Afghanistan now dealing with – no matter what their task is – what is a very complex security environment, as we have seen evidenced again in the last few days. They continue a contribution which – of which we are very proud."
"In terms of the enhancement of that contribution of 30 personnel, as you have indicated, that is in general accord with the nature of the request that we received from NATO, which was indeed supported by the United States, and we are very comfortable with that. As a nation, we make the second largest non-NATO contribution to the people of Afghanistan, and we are in the top 10 financial contributors to Afghanistan through the (inaudible)."
"So these are a strong indication of Australia’s preparedness to be engaged in what is an ongoing international fight against violent extremists and against terrorists. I agree completely with Jim: they can’t win a ballot, so they use weapons to try and fight their way out. That’s not something we are ever prepared to see take hold in Afghanistan again. As Secretary Tillerson also says, it must never be allowed to be a platform for terrorism as it was in the past, and we will continue to make that contribution. It’s why we made the announcement that we made last week. "
"As the United States and the NATO support mission develop their approach, we will engage in those discussions, as we always do, and we will play our – we will make our own views known, play our part, and any further decisions are a matter for time – consideration at that time. "
"QUESTION: Can I follow up my question to Secretary Tillerson? I actually asked you what your view was on the wisdom of adding more U.S. troops and resources to Afghanistan. I’m aware of the fact that the policies are under review, but what is your view on that? "
SECRETARY TILLERSON: I would reserve my answer until the policy review is completed. It needs to be thought of in that context. 
"MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. "
"Secretary of Defense Ash Carter met with Japanese Minister of Defense Gen Nakatani on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, a major annual forum for key leaders in the Asia-Pacific region, to discuss security challenges and opportunities."

"Well, good morning, everyone. And just look at this magnificent crowd. It makes me so proud to be here with you."
"My friend, Minister Sajjan, General Cienfuegos, Admiral Soberón, Chairman Dunford, members of the NORAD and NORTHCOM team, friends and family, what an honor to be with you here today as we pass this critical command between two of our military's most accomplished leaders, Admiral William Gortney and General Lori Robinson."
"Before I speak about the character and the contributions of these two extraordinary officers, I want to speak directly to you, to the men and women of these vital commands. In the center of our nation, you perform a mission at the center of everything we do as a department. Every day, you work across our military, across our governments, and with our closest neighbors to prepare for contingencies, to provide missile defense, keep our skies free from danger. "
"And you're also responsible for keeping our most solemn commitment as a military, to provide our citizens here at home the security they need to dream their dreams, raise their children, live full lives."
"Your missions here at NORAD and NORTHCOM are diverse, and challenges that you and the department face are many. In fact, today, we face no fewer than five major, immediate and evolving challenges - countering the prospect of Russian aggression and coercion, especially in Europe; managing historic change in the vital Asia-Pacific region; strengthening our deterrent and defense forces in the face of North Korea's nuclear provocations; checking Iranian aggression and malign influence in the Persian Gulf, and accelerating the defeat of ISIL and its parent tumor in Iraq and Syria, and everywhere else it's metastasizing around the world."
"NORTHCOM plays a role in all of them, but this time, at this ceremony, I'd like to focus on the fifth challenge, the defeat of ISIL.  ISIL not only tyrannizes the populations where it arose in Iraq and Syria, but also attempts to spread its evil ideology elsewhere. It aspires to plot, or inspire attacks on Americans - including here at home."
"Our strategy for the lasting defeat of ISIL, therefore, is built around and will surely accomplish three objectives. One, destroying ISIL's parent tumor in Iraq and Syria. And I say lasting defeat of ISIL, because when ISIL is defeated - and it will be - it must stay defeated."
"This fact requires that we strengthen and enable with the vast power of the United States military and the international coalition arrayed with it, capable local forces, who can seize, hold and govern territory ISIL seized when it arose."
"The Coalition is providing strong support for Iraqi Security Forces, under the control of Prime Minister Abadi, who have retaken the cities of Ramadi and Hit, and are making steady advances up the Euphrates River Valley.  In Northern Iraq, we're also supporting and enabling Iraqi forces and Kurdish forces as they begin operations to envelop Mosul, one of ISIL's two main power centers."
"Meanwhile, in Syria, capable and motivated local forces there, supported by the Coalition, have retaken Tishrin Dam in the west and the town of Shaddadi in the east. In doing so, they've cut two significant lines of communication into ISIL's stronghold of Raqqa, and cut the main link from the city to ISIL's power center in Iraq, Mosul. "
"We're also pressuring ISIL in both Iraq and Syria by systematically eliminating their so-called cabinet. We've taken out their ministers of war and finance, captured one of the architects of ISIL's chemical warfare enterprise. And most recently, we killed the ISIL's military Emir for Anbar Province.  At the same time, we're continuing attacks on ISIL's economic infrastructure - from oil wells and trucks, to cash storage sites - putting a stranglehold on ISIL's ability to pay its fighters, finance its operations and attract new recruits."
"In pursuit of ISIL's lasting defeat in Iraq and Syria, we have a clear plan of operations, which depends on enabling capable, local forces to collapse ISIL's control, especially in their two centers of power, Mosul and Raqqa.  Our accelerated campaign continues to gather strength as we support these local forces and find additional opportunities to hit ISIL in new ways."
"We're also addressing ISIL's metastasis beyond Iraq and Syria, which is our second campaign objective. In Afghanistan, with new authorities and an added focus, we've been able to significantly degrade the group there. In Libya, we've undertaken successful strikes against a training camp and taken out ISIL's key leader of that country.  Whether in the Middle East, West Africa or south or southeast Asia or here in the homeland, we will counter ISIL and work with partners wherever ISIL has or tries to gain a foothold."
"Now, achieving these first two objectives against ISIL is necessary, but it's not sufficient. We must at the same time protect the homeland. While there's no credible imminent threat, ISIL has made its intent clear, that they seek to plot or incite attacks in this country. Every day, our homeland security, intelligence and law enforcement agencies are aggressively and skillfully working to prevent that from happening.  And I want to commend FBI Director Jim Comey, Director of National Intelligence Jim Clapper, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson and CIA Director John Brennan and others for all they're doing and for their impressive results."
"Protecting the homeland requires vision and collaboration across these Departments and agencies, and to get to the point of this ceremony, DOD plays a vital supporting role. That's especially true at NORTHCOM, a Command which was established to support homeland defense in the aftermath of September 11."
"DOD supports whole of government efforts to protect the homeland in three critical ways. First, we're disrupting ISIL's operations and ability to conduct external attacks from abroad. Next, we're disrupting the flow of foreign fighters both to and from Iraq and Syria. And next, we're investing resources to provide greater force projection to our troops here at home. "
"To take the first one, DOD is pursuing a systematic effort to disrupt ISIL's external operations by removing terrorists from the battlefield who are planning, directing or inspiring attacks against Americans. Just two weeks ago in Mosul, we killed Neil Prakash, the last remaining member of an ISIL cell calling for lone wolf attacks in this country. "
"One week earlier in Syria, we also killed two more of ISIL's prominent facilitators of external attacks and recruiters of foreign fighters. Abu Sa’ad al-Sudani and his wife, Shadi Jabar Khalil Mohammed, both killed. "
"Last year in Syria, we killed Junaid Hussain, a central figure in recruiting ISIS sympathizers to carry out lone wolf attacks in the West. It was also Hussain who was responsible for releasing personally identifiable information of more than 1,000 U.S. military and government employees and who sought to inspire want-to-be jihadists to conduct attacks against us in DOD."
I am in no doubt and no one should have any doubt: those who threaten or incite harm against Americans will surely come to feel the long arm and the hard fist of justice. We will take decisive action against any ISIL member or leader planning to attack our country or encouraging others to do the same. 
"We undertake these operations kinetically, but also through our expanding Cyber Mission Force. While I can't discuss many of these efforts publicly, I can say that DOD cyber capabilities are being employed in Iraq and Syria to prevent the ISIL threat from this region homeland. We're using these tools to deny the ability of ISIL leadership to command and finance their forces and control their populations, to identify and locate ISIL cyber actors and undermine the ability of ISIL recruiters to inspire or direct Homegrown Violent Extremists."
"We're also working to disrupt the flow of foreign fighters into and out of ISIL-controlled territory. Specifically, DOD is sharing what it collects from the battlefield with other domestic departments that are the leads for screening and watch-listing. For instance, when we collect fingerprints from an IED in Iraq or Syria, or personal information removed from terrorists, we include this information in our biometrics-enabled watch list, which is then shared with the relevant agencies across our government."
We're also fusing and sharing information and expertise across the international coalition to stem foreign fighter flows and help prevent attacks. 
"When I met with several Coalition-counterparts last week in Germany, including my colleague from Canada, I reviewed ongoing operations to support local forces working to close the Manbij area of Syria to ISIL, which is a critical transit point for terrorists planning to execute attacks outside Iraq and Syria. Together, we must close this last entry-exit area for foreign fighters into Europe and beyond once and for all."
"Next, we're providing greater force protection for our troops and DOD civilians here at home. As we learned from the tragedy in Chattanooga last summer, ISIL has demonstrated a clear intent to target U.S. servicemembers and facilities, or at least inspire others to do so. Providing greater force protection for men and women serving today is one way we honor those servicemembers who lost their lives last August."
"As part of our response to those events, we're stepping up protection at bases and at the thousands of off-base installations we operate, a mission which is under NORTHCOM's authority. We're putting in place stronger physical security systems, including stronger entry controls, better alarm systems, reinforced doors, and additional ways to safely exit our facilities."
"We're also introducing a mass warning and notification capability to broadcast threats quickly and broadly, notifying DOD personnel within a 20-mile radius of a threat within minutes. That's a direct response to Chattanooga, where the killer targeted two facilities 11 miles apart within the span of 12 minutes."
"Overall, we're investing an additional $80 million in force protection this year and an additional $100 million more over the next two years. At DOD, we're absolutely committed to strengthening and defending our people and facilities from potential threats of all kinds."
"Part of our responsibility as a military is also to keep some of the gravest threats to our people and nation at the front of our minds. While we have seen no credible evidence of a WMD threat against the homeland by any extremist group, ISIL's use of chemical weapons in Iraq underscores the importance of constant monitoring of potential threats even remote ones."
"This work also connects directly to another important part of NORTHCOM's mission, which involves providing support for partners across our government, including the FBI, to prepare for extreme threats and disasters. "
"In cases where the interests of the United States would be seriously threatened, the department maintains a unique readiness to provide capabilities such as airlift, communications, and logistics support to federal, state, and local law enforcement. "
"Just this month, DOD participated in a planned training exercise, NORTHCOM's VITAL ARCHER, working with the FBI as well as other domestic agencies to enhance our preparation and integration in responding to an incident involving WMD in the homeland."
"The Department also stands ready to respond to chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear attacks and disasters everywhere. The DOD chemical, radiological and nuclear response enterprise is comprised of National Guard and active duty forces, including 8,200 men and women under the command and control of NORTHCOM.  We will continue to train, plan and prepare for extreme circumstances when state response capabilities are exceeded and the lead federal agency requests and requires our support."
"As we pursue a whole of nation, whole of government effort to protect the homeland, you, the men and women of NORTHCOM, are providing steadfast support to the Department of Homeland Security and FBI. The American people and your families, our families, can sleep soundly knowing that you and your colleagues across our government are awake to defend and protect them."
"Keeping our people and nation safe and delivering ISIL a lasting defeat also depends on how effectively we work with our coalition partners. Of course, here at NORAD, our only by bi-national command, this issue comes naturally to many of you. "
"Whether in defeating ISIL or in defending our nation against other threats that reach across borders, our alliance with Canada is indispensable. The United States and Canada are working together every hour of every day to provide a more prosperous and secure future for the citizens of both our nations. "
"I also want to thank our Mexican partners for their determination to expand our continental defense partnership. Mexico has become a global exporter of security, both on this continent and beyond. I want to applaud Mexico for their growing defense relationship and also for continuing to ensure that common values and respect for human rights are the foundation of security efforts across the hemisphere and around the world."
"Now, let me turn to the change of leadership for the Command that performs so much of the work I've been speaking about, change from one gifted Commander to another. "
"This Commander of NORAD and NORTHCOM, Admiral Bill Gortney, has been instrumental in forging stronger coordination and deeper connections with both our Mexican and our Canadian neighbors. "
"For Bill Gortney, serving and defending this nation has been the cause of his life for the better part of four decades.  With his father, who was also a Naval officer and aviator, this is a commitment that runs deep in his veins. Still, Bill has said that growing up, he never intended to follow in the footsteps of his father. "
"That all changed the first time he stepped on an aircraft carrier and heard a powerful call to serve, and because Bill Gortney has followed that call with passion and commitment ever since, our Navy is stronger, our nation's more secure. "
"During his service as a Naval Aviator, he logged more than 5,000 piloting A-7s and F/A-18 Hornets. He made more than 1,200 carrier landings and flew combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. And after accumulating a tremendous record of success as a pilot, he transitioned seamlessly to become one of the Navy's most successful sailor-statesmen."
"With his work to bring a diverse collection of nations together to respond to piracy in the Indian Ocean, just to take one example, he leaves a lasting legacy.  By breaking down silos between the services and between partner navies, which included the Russians and the Chinese, Bill was at the center of building a formidable coalition. "
"When he began this work, piracy off the Horn of Africa was not only a growing scourge, it was a weight on the global economy and a threat to the rules-based international order. Today, the number of large cargo and container ships seized by pirates in the region can be counted on one hand."
"Across continents and assignments, Bill and his wife Sherry have been a formidable team, building inclusive and welcoming communities wherever they have served. During two assignments in Bahrain, Bill and Sherry were critical in helping families cope with an impending separation when dependents were order to return home. When the order was lifted, and families returned, Bill and Sherry's hospitality were instrumental in rebuilding a strong sense of community there."
"Several years ago, when Bill delivered the commencement address at his alma mater, Elon College, he spoke about what he had recently read on a plaque near the Statue of Liberty. They were the lines of another warrior statesman, an advocate for peace and freedom in the Americas, Jose Marti. The inscription read, and I quote, ""Liberty costs a great price, and one must either resign oneself to live without it or decide to pay its price."""
"Admiral Gortney, you have long understood that the price of liberty is great. And over the course of your accomplished career, you've borne it with great skill and strength. On behalf of the department, you and Sherry have our deepest appreciation for your selfless service to our nation. Thank you, Bill."
"And Bill, as you transition from this command, you can take comfort in knowing that NORAD and NORTHCOM are now in the hands of another proven strategic leader and warrior-diplomat, General Lori Robinson. "
"I recommended General Robinson to the president because she has a remarkable and complete set of proven experience: her strength as a strategic thinker and manager, which I saw first-hand during her time in the Pentagon when I worked with her closely; her political and military experience, most recently - and this is very important - in the critical Asia-Pacific region; and her ability to lead and command in high-tempo operational environments, while putting her people first in every assignment."
"As a strategic thinker and joint force leader, General Robinson has proven her ability to manage complex operations and work with partners across theaters and domains. These abilities will serve our nation well as NORAD and NORTHCOM continue their vital contributions to the counter-ISIL campaign and defense of the homeland."
"Now, General Robinson is an Air Force Weapons Officer, which means she has proven her mettle by passing through one of our military's most demanding crucibles. And though Lori passed through weapons school with flying colors, it was not only her individual success, but the shared determination she inspired among her teammates, they say, that left another lasting impression."
"This ability to lead and inspire is an attribute she has carried with her to command roles in some of the most difficult and complex environments. General Robinson's success as an air battle manager, a role that requires conceptualizing combat operations in a fluid, three-dimensional space, and making split-second life-or-death decisions, is another tribute to her strength as a leader.  In one of the most high-pressure and high-stakes environments in our entire military enterprise, Lori thrived."
Part of her success as Air Battle Manager came from developing a deep knowledge of the different traditions and cultures among the different technical specialities within the Air Force. It was an experience where she learned to communicate up and down the chain of command and began to deepen her extensive political-military skills.
"In her most recent tour as PACAF Commander, she demonstrated these capabilities over an area of responsibility covering nearly half the globe. She was instrumental in operationalizing our important rebalance to the Pacific, and in strengthening ties with air forces of some of our closest allies, including Japan, South Korea and Australia. And while there are many leaders who played a role in bringing the Indian Air Force back to Fed Flag, few were more instrumental than Lori Robinson."
"Lori's ability to lead, inspire and command respect across our joint force reflects her understanding that no matter what the complexity of our platforms or the power of our technology, it's always our people who come first."
"It's a value she shares with her husband, David, who's a former Thunderbird and a retired Major General in the Air Force Reserve. Lori and David are two leaders who appreciate personally the weight of all we ask our troops and their loved ones to carry. And for many families who experienced loss, their own strength and resilience have served as an inspiration."
"General Robinson has described her philosophy of leadership simply as this: leaders should be humble, approachable and credible to those entrusted to their command. Today, she brings that spirit to the solemn responsibilities of NORAD and NORTHCOM and to her leadership of men and women whose success is vital to the defense of our homeland."
"In the days to come, we cannot predict precisely how and when men and women of NORAD and NORTHCOM will be called forward to carry their mission, but we do know this. We know General Robinson will lead this team with certainty, clarity and with the full trust and confidence of me and the President. "
"We know that as our military works with partners across our government and across our continent, NORAD and NORTHCOM's efforts will be essential in providing security for our people and our nation."
"And we know this with absolute certainty. The force General Robinson inherits is ready to execute its final responsibilities thanks to Admiral Gortney's leadership. To Admiral Gortney, to General Robinson, to all the men and women who have served under their strong and steady leadership, thank you."
"SEC. MATTIS:  Yes.  But, yes, it's good to see you.  So you're staying out here in God's country though?"
Q:  Absolutely.
SEC. MATTIS:  Anywhere west of the 100th meridian (inaudible) --
"Q:  You will not get me within the Beltway willingly, I'm good."
"SEC. MATTIS:  Yes, wisdom.  But coming out here, Secretary of the Air Force Wilson, General Goldfein, and the Air Force Academy's class graduation 1,000, just sitting up there and looking at 1,000 brand new officers ready to go."
"Obviously just in the moments when I got to shake their hand and have a word or two, literally not much more than that, but just the eagerness with which they have embraced serving the country at a time when a lot of people say, ""Well, that's for other people.  I don't do that, you know, that stuff is dangerous.  That stuff is -- is, you know, it -- it can cause you to have problems and everything.""  And there they are, just high-quality -- eye watering quality of these -- these young volunteers who look right past all the hot political rhetoric and sign up."
"But they're -- they're certainly going to make a mark on the Air Force, when you think of 1,000 people coming out of there.  And there were two Air Force Academy grads sitting next to me, one on the left, one on the right who basically rose to the highest levels of the civilian leadership and the military leadership of the Air Force.  So it's a great school.  It was a real pleasure, plus an honor to come out and pay my respects to all the families and those young -- young lieutenants."
"Tomorrow, I'm going to be over at NORTHCOM and NORAD.  Those two commands are commanded by the same officer, U.S. Northern Command includes the Bahamas, and Mexico, Canada, the United States.  And NORAD, of course, is the Canadian-American quote combined command."
"But General Robinson, who has been there for these last years, will transfer command over to General O'Shaughnessy.  And she's done a great job, at a time when there were a lot of responsibilities, from storms -- significant storms, one after another.  But at the same time, she was expected to keep her eyes and the eyes of our radar operating and all peeled on the -- on the Northwestern Pacific and the DPRK Korea situation."
"It's NORAD's 60th anniversary this year.  And it's interesting, I'll also be my counterparts -- and there's two in Mexico, the way their government's organized.  But my counterparts from Mexico will be there as well as my counterpart from -- from Canada."
"And what we're really seeing is a North American powerhouse developing, one where the economies, the fact that they're both -- they're all democracies.  The fact that on the military to military side, we have very warm, very trusted relations between our militaries, and all of us there tomorrow to -- to be there as the command is transferred from one officer to another."
"The deputy at NORAD is a Canadian three-star.  And this is where much of what we do in space and what of -- much of what we do in cyberspace comes in, as we defend basically the North American continent is what's going on there against air-breathing and non-air-breathing threats."
"Minister Sajjan, he is the -- and his chief of defense staff from Canada -- he is a, of course, someone I know very well from being a NATO ally.  We see each other often.  We talk even more often.  And then, we have very close relations in NORAD with Canada."
"But under Northern Command, we have the same with Mexico and Canada.  And General Cienfuegos and Admiral Soberon will be here.  They're organized with the military department and a navy department, and that's why they're both here.  But they're -- they're very much honored guests and we continue to strengthen the ties between our militaries."
"The -- until two weeks ago, the only full honors parade I have held in Washington, D.C. in my first year was with Mexico and Canada.  And then, we just did one here about 10 days ago with Sweden and Finland.  But it shows the priority that we place on them inside the U.S. military, and the trusted relation that we've maintained."
"But as the threats to North America evolve, we'll have to evolve the command too.  It will continue to adapt from what it does, incorporating cyber defenses, outer space priorities and -- and, of course, the -- the air-breathing threats that we'll have to stay alert to."
"You're -- you're aware, I think, that we have just turned out here in the last months -- well, actually now it's a little while -- January, the National Defense Strategy.  It is the first National Defense Strategy in over 10 years.  So what we inherited was -- was a strategy-free defense effort."
"And you'll see symptoms of this, hopefully, in our rearview mirror because the lack of predictable funding -- because funding 9 of the last 10 years was under C.R.s, or what we called continuing resolutions.  And what that meant was, if there were evolving threat or a thing we needed to adapt to, number one, we didn't have a strategic framework within which you'd go, for example, to the Congress and say here's why we want additional money here."
"You don't get additional money when you're under C.R.  That's one of the penalties of being under one.  But also, without the steady budget, we could not do new starts.  So things from the Army's modernization program, to cyber efforts, to outer space efforts were either stillborn or just put in a dormant status."
"And so, as we look at this now, we have to look at what do we have to do in order to make up for lost time.  And we are doing that with the bipartisan support of the Congress to pass the two-year authorization bill and the -- excuse me, the Omnibus bill.  And so, now we have a strategic framework."
"Now we have the Congress back in -- no longer in a spectator role, but actually saying where they want money put.  There will be arguments, and -- and good arguments, about where the priorities should be.  And that's up to us to make certain we can bring the -- the analysis that we have in of defining problems and what solutions we want to bring forward.  At the same time, we have to recognize that -- that the changes that we're making have got to, in many cases, be things that bring allies onboard.  So the changes that we want to create are, we want to make the military more lethal in outer space and cyberspace, at sea, on land, and in the air.  And we want to do so as much as possible by strengthening our partners and our allies."
"But we're going to have to do it with business reforms inside the Pentagon, and the reason for this is, we are not right now adopting best practices of American industry, the Congress has actually had to step in and reorganize our acquisition, technology and logistics oversight into research and engineering for the future, and then acquisition sustainment.  And the two people I have there, the former head of NASA for one, and Ellen Lord, who is risen to the top of an American industry in a corporation."
"Those two, as one congressman put it to me, you are in danger of creating sustainable reform in the Pentagon.  But one of the points I would make to you is, I cannot right now, look you in the eye and say that we can tell you that every penny in the past has been spent in a strategically sound and auditable manner.  And so this year, for the first time in 70 years, the Pentagon will perform an audit."
"We'll have an audit done of itself and I look forward to every problem we find, because we're going to fix every one of them.  So I can look you people in the eye and say I'm getting your money and here's what I'm doing with it.  Number one, know exactly where it's going, but number two, breed your trust that the money that's coming to us is adapting to the changing character of war."
"Right now, we're not looking at any fundamental changes in the nature of war; well that too, but the changing character of war and things like artificial intelligence or hypersonics, outer space activities, both offense and defense.  These have all got to be looked at, because as we say in the U.S. Department of Defense, our adversaries get a vote and you have to deal with that if we're going to keep this -- keep this experiment of All-America alive."
"So I just want to touch on why we have some of the problems we have right now.  I think there's a bipartisan way forward with this strategy and the budget as long as I can how an audit and have their confidence.  And we'll have to be very careful as we look at past problems or problems that we are dealing with today to make certain we define what was the source of the problem, so we don't take off and start solving problems that don't need to be solved or we solve the wrong problems."
"We do everything -- somebody said, this is the way we're going to do it and then we find we never agreed on what the problem was.  So like Einstein said when he was asked what would you do if you had one hour to save the world, and he said something along the lines of, I'd spend 55 minutes defining the problem and then save the world in 5 minutes."
"So in a democracy -- in a democracy where we have civilian control of the military and a democracy where the Constitution says the Congress is actually the people who raise armies and sustain navies and this sort of thing, we're going to have to have a shared understanding and appreciation of the problems that we'll have to solve."
"So there's enough, I hope that gives you at least something to understand the framework that I addressed, the duties that I have.  And obviously I can go on in some length as far as details down below.  Why don't we switch over to your Q&A now, because pretty soon, I'm going to get told I have to go get ready for something else."
"Q:   Mr. Secretary, I'd like to as you about something very current that's happening today.  China was disinvited to RIMPAC, and I'm wondering if you can say what the message is there and if there's a danger or ratcheting up of tensions."
"SEC. MATTIS:  Yeah, we are not ratcheting up anything.  In fact, we believe firmly on a stable a Pacific -- we're a Pacific island nation -- excuse me -- a Pacific Ocean nation.  Five of our states have coastlines along the Pacific, plus Guam and other American territories.  What we are doing is, we are cooperating with China wherever we can, and we are going to have to also confront them when we believe that the rule of law or that matters that can destabilize the region are being pursued."
"We maintain open communications with China, our military operations are transparent up there.  But so long as China continues to militarize features in the South China Sea and what is traditionally, historically, international waters, and militarizing them with weapons that, just a few years ago, they said they would not be putting there, then we have to acknowledge that reality."
"Q:  You talked about outer space quite a bit.  And the elephant in the room around here has been the idea of a space force.  Last time I caught up with you, was kind of the last time this went through the cycle, you were on the Mike Rogers push.  Where are you at now?"
"SEC. MATTIS:  Yeah, if -- if we dropped back, one of the challenges right now, and it frankly, I like having congressmen not just involved but digging into issues.  That is in my best interest, and go back to what I said about Einstein.  We need to define the problem.  Right now, no matter what the U.S. Air Force did or tried to do over the last 10 years was C.R.s as the -- the -- as the representative budgetary mechanism we have dealt with for 10 years, in the absence of a strategy that does what this strategy does, talking about great power competition for example."
"The Air Force somehow, and I don't even know how they did it, managed to maintain America's primacy in space and do it right now, and then at this point, to the X-37.  I mean, they managed to put something up that -- with the lack of budgetary and strategic frameworks, support, somehow they were able to do it."
"But to look now at the problem, means we have to look afresh at it.  And where are the specific problems, break them down, and if an organizational construct has to change, then I'm wide open to it.  My deputy is a man with great background in air, space -- his corporation that I joined from has a great background.  This is not someone who looks at these issues through talking points or briefing points on a power point slide."
"Further, I've got someone in there from NASA who has -- has dealt with this.  And I'm -- again, talking points, not putting forward agendas, but looking at the science.  So what we are going to have to do is define -- continue to define, probably have some studies coming out, there have been some very good work done on them -- and when we see what the studies bring forward as the problem statement, then we'll solve it."
"OK?  You break the problem down into bite-sized pieces, because you understand we've got to solve space.  You know, that -- that provides zero fidelity for what we have to do, but you have to do it, break down everything from what is our -- what is our strategy for space?  What are our arms control of it -- almost call it initiatives for space?  What are we doing to set the strategic framework there?"
"And we've got a lot of work done on it, and as we go forward on this, as we define those problems specifically, then we'll find is that an acquisition system has to change.  And right now, I've got a innovation board, and I'm amazed that I bring in from Silicon Valley and everywhere else, and -- or, on the business board, policy board, these boards have really capable people."
"And the acquisition system keeps coming up as an emblem of why the Army's had problems with its modernization.  Why space has had problems.  Why the Navy?  After a while, you know, even I can figure out we've got a problem at acquisition.  So to say we're going to solve that problem may be both distinct but -- from but integral to the space issue."
"And why am I giving you such a long answer?  Because if we don't define the problems right, we're going to solve the wrong problems.  Or..."
Q:  What my question is -- are we reinventing the wheel here?  Because we had a solution for that.  It was a command here in town.  Last commander was...
SEC. MATTIS:  Yes.
Q:  ...Ed Eberhart.
"Q:  And we had -- U.S. Space Commander was in charge of strategy in acquisitions, planning..."
Q:  And -- and it was all in one house.
Q:  Did we have a solution of losing it?
"SEC. MATTIS:  I'm not willing to say that yet, because I -- even there, I've got to know what are the specific problems that, when you transition -- when we transitioned as a department from what you're defining to what it is today, it would -- did that bring the problems?  Or were there other problems that evolved from simply our adversaries' approach to space?"
"So most of the time, I find the simple answers are -- are glaringly incomplete.  So we -- I think when we get the two space studies done that are underway now, and -- and they probably would be even melded, because they're feeding each other -- we'll have the problem straightened out."
"So I'm just real reluctant to go, for example, after the Army's modernization program, but it may well be that 10 years of CRs -- we may actually have the solution waiting for us, but I'm also eager just to go in and grab an old solution.  That's why I go back to defining the problem, whether it be for the Army or outer space or wherever."
Go ahead.
"Q:  I wanted to talk a little bit more about the space, because there's so much aerospace in (inaudible)..."
SEC. MATTIS:  Sure.
"Q:  And are you using, like -- you talked a little bit about civilian partners to figure out, like, what you need and?"
"SEC. MATTIS:  Well, I mean, we're in (inaudible) with NASA space -- I mean, we're -- we're looking at all people who have equities there or who have, you know, especially ideas to offer.  That sort of thing."
"So it is -- I would say it's open, but we have a rigor, inside our own system that makes certain that what we're getting are disciplined ideas brought forward for back briefing Congress, for example.  There's some congressmen that are very involved in this.  They're -- they're being kept up to date, but most of all, I'd say it's the labs and the -- the government agencies.  But we've also got a lot of interaction going on with the private industry folks."
Q:  OK.  And what are the two studies that you've ordered and authorized...
"SEC. MATTIS:  Well, no, the Congress has ordered up studies."
Q:  OK.
"SEC. MATTIS:  One of them has to do with the organization of how we're integrating space more broadly, OK?  And that -- that is -- it's not a space specific, but space has become so critical that I'm -- I know we're going to get more on that.  One is the ballistic missile defense review -- excuse me, the missile defense review.  It also takes care of cruise missiles, that sort of thing under -- you know, inside it."
And then the other one is the - the study that we have going on right now on space that we owe to Congress.
Q:  You focused on -- you focused on space and also on spending taxpayer money wisely.
"Q:  Both of those things -- on both of those areas, Congress seems to want to push forward.  They're looking at laying the groundwork for space corps on this year's NDAA."
SEC. MATTIS:  Some people are.
"Q:  Some people are.  Chairman Thornberry is looking at cuts to the Fourth Estate across the board.  Do you feel like Congress -- it's a little premature, to, like, more forward on those things?  It sounds like the Pentagon is..."
"SEC. MATTIS:  Well I don't they're moving forward too fast.  I think they're bringing legitimate issues up.  Both of the ones you brought up.  There's others as well.  But frankly, I -- the -- you know, national defense is not a partisan issue.  So I can move forward in concert with them, and the -- the -- we enjoy and the authorization or appropriations committees, the HASC and the SASC?  We enjoy wide bipartisan support."
"Again, this is why I want to make certain we define the problem, and if we can come to an agreement on the problem, the solution will probably be more easily acceptable by everyone."
"For example, when in -- the last administration, there was a sense that the Pentagon was consumed with the current wars and not paying attention to the future wars.  Eventually, the Congress, frankly, got fed up with just being given the stiff arm, and so they directed the change in the Office of Secretary of Defense, I came in, generally speaking, I think executive branches ought to organize as best they can on their own."
"But after examining, getting ready for my confirmation hearing, after looking at what they had done -- which I did not fully understand, because those -- again, we -- we had a -- we had an organization that was doing both those things before.  Then I went back and read the problem statement.  The Congress was right.  They were 100 percent right."
"So we embraced the bottom line, went out and found the best people we could get, Ellen Lord and Mike Griffin and -- and we're going to use that.  And some of you are going to say, well you've got to -- you know, you've got a separate thing going on.  Yes we do."
"But it -- they are sufficiently different in an age of this kind of dynamic technological change that you need someone who's working only on that.  Not trying to also acquire and sustain the force that's currently fighting in Syria, and we're trying to get more shipped into the Pacific Fleet.  That's a here and now issue.  We need somebody looking at hypersonics, artificial intelligence, directed energy, big data, you know, all these things that will change the character of combat in the future."
"So you see where Congress -- that they'll work with us.  I am -- I have very candid discussions with Congress, and I have yet to find one of -- any congressman that wakes up in the morning with the idea of weakening America's defense.  Not running into them"
"Q:  The reason I ask is because just the timing for this fiscal year -- it doesn't seem like it would match up, because the space study, I guess, would be turned over to Congress in December.  The audit is going to be fall timeframe, but you're going to have -- the NDAA's probably going to be mostly crafted by then.  So if Congress has an appetite to renew one of those issues, it's going to come before..."
"SEC. MATTIS:  Oh, no, no, I -- I think -- I think as long as we maintain a good -- I mean, it's not like nothing happened until December 3 on the war on deceits.  So we'll continue to work in collaborating very closely.  We have yet to have my Secretary of the Air Force, Secretary of the Navy, Chief of Staff of the Army, myself, my Deputy Secretary, shut out of something up on the Hill."
They're eager -- both parties -- both sides are eager to work with us.  We have not felt any reticence on that -- on that aspect.
"Q:  I love journalism conversations of the press, because they-- often they focus on things.  So I'm going to take you to a different spot, talk about people.  There are issues the DOD has been trying to solve for the past 20 years.  Sexual assault, (inaudible) discipline in the ranks, having people who are healthy enough to deploy."
How are you putting your stamp on...?
SEC. MATTIS:  What was the second one?  In the ranks?
Q:  Good order and discipline.
"SEC. MATTIS:  Oh, the -- more broadly."
Q:  Yes.
"SEC. MATTIS:  OK, I see.  OK, yes."
"Q:  How are you putting your stamp on that, and how are James Mattis' morals getting pushed down to that private in a foxhole in Afghanistan?  How are you making sure that these units are -- you know, because we just kicked two brigades out the door to Afghanistan on Fort Carson, and they went -- they're leaving large for your detachments from people who are too broken to get home."
How are you fixing that?  Some of these people issues that are...
Q:  ...pretty much Jim Mattis problems.
"SEC. MATTIS:  Well, I mean they're -- they're our country's problems, to a degree.  I -- I don't think it's possible for anyone to look at what's going on in this society in terms of sexual assault with anything other than sadness and a conviction that this has to cease."
"The military brings in somewhere around a quarter of a million, mostly very young people, every year.  Think about it.  A quarter of a million.  We have a societal problem, and in the military -- OK, and in the military, we expect that people will conduct themselves in a disciplined manner."
"So if you look at it more broadly, you cannot have an effective fighting force is it's riven with -- I don't care what the tension is, if it's something that distracts from the unity of the force, what we call unit cohesion, then it is something that is undercutting the lethality of the military.  And the lethality of the military, the increasing is my number one priority."
"Now I accept that when we send these young volunteers into wars, the matter of war is that there's going to be some of them who are going to be casualties.  That is the reality, and every one of them who comes in knows what they're getting into.  I do not accept a single casualty of sexual assault of one of us on our -- on someone serving alongside us.  So part of this is making certain, not only that the troops know what I stand for, it's making very clear what I, and the Department of Defense and their leadership, will not stand for."
"Now, when you bring in a quarter-million people a year, let me just say, I spent a lot of time on college campuses in my three and a half years out of the Marines.  There is behavior on college campuses, routinely, that would never be tolerated in the U.S. Military.  It would earn them immediate censure."
"So long as we recruit from that society, and that -- we have to recognize that a progressive American society, a classically liberal society in which human dignity and freedom is prioritized, may need a U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, Marine Corps, that has rather quaint or old fashioned values about discipline, self-discipline being primary, unit discipline, chivalry, the controlled use of violence, that sort of thing."
"And as we look at some of the issues in society, clearly we have work to do when we bring them in.  That's why you put everyone through a socialization process; you and I know it as basic training.  And that basic training will often change people forever."
"But I will remind you that we are the good guys, we're not the perfect guys.  So we are also going to have to maintain a disciplinary code that holds people accountable.  And on that score, we do that."
"And I would just tell you that we're committed to the ethical midfield.  We want people staying in the ethical midfield.  That way, if they make a minor mistake, they're still not out of bounds."
"They're still on the playing field.  And that's when the first sergeant gets his arm around his shoulder and says, ""Let's have a little talk there, son.""  The way a first sergeant or a master chief petty officer can do that, which is rather compelling."
"But if they're running the ethical sidelines and they make a mistake, now they're out of bounds.  Now you got a problem.  And at that point, investigators are there and the unit now is oftentimes broken apart into who said what and who did what.  And so, this is a -- this is a military discipline, military effectiveness issue."
Q:  At a time...
SEC. MATTIS:  This is not to be dismissed as some politically correct approach to life.
"Q:  ... At a time when truth is becoming kind of relative, according to -- at least, what I watch on FOX and CNN.  When some of the normal morals seem to be kind of out the window on how we communicate with each other, does that make your job harder to find that ethical midfield?"
"SEC. MATTIS:  I just take it as my job.  I don't think of it as harder or easier, Tom.  I guess, I -- the way I'd say it is that the military is going to remain a standards-based organization.  What would be -- what -- what -- how can I explain that, 70 percent -- actually, it's more than 70 percent of 18 to 24-year-old males and females cannot qualify to be a private in the Army."
"So when someone calls it 70 -- well, I'm told it's 72 percent, it's unfortunately going up.  This is combination of illicit drug abuse, illicit drug use, obesity is probably the biggest one, morals, you know, just arrests, that sort of thing and -- and there are other reasons.  You know, that -- you know, they can't pass the academics, that sort of thing."
"So, in -- in the midst of that, we -- we try to screen certain people.  But we also accept the military have been hand-up for people who come from rough backgrounds.  So we don't want to get to the point where we're refusing anyone a chance to get -- everyone a chance to get -- get back on their feet.  But we are no longer receiving people from the society who are as much in step with the qualities that our institution must have for success on the battlefield."
"And any institution gets the behavior rewards.  So part of what we do, after we make clear the standards -- excuse me, I've been talking too much..."
"Q:  Oh, good heavens."
SEC. MATTIS:  ... The last couple of weeks.
"SEC. MATTIS:  But what we've got to do is we've got to have reward systems that reward people for the right behavior, sometimes nothing more than just calling them out and saying, ""You did the right thing."" you know, promotes the right people."
"We need physically fit, mentally sharp, and morally strong people.  And so, we have to reward that.  And if someone doesn't measure up, we either don't let them in or, if they don't measure up while they're in, they're going to be held accountable.  And the behavior will not be tolerated."
"You're -- you know, it's an interesting question though because eventually any military does represent, you know, does reflect a society.  And so far, in many cases, we're having to push people outside their comfort zone for the kinds of behavior that we'll accept or not accept."
STAFF:  Anything else?
"Q:  Sure.  I'd like to ask you about Muqtada Al-Sadr.  You were asked about this, I think, a week or so ago.  And the election results of Iraq were still out and you said let's wait and see what the results are."
"Q:  And it looks like now that his coalition did win.  And, you know, some people who have served in -- in the Iraq war have had mixed feeling, and maybe even some kind of confusion about how something like this could happen."
"I want to specifically how you feel about Muqtada Al-Sadr, but I'm interested in the -- the larger issue here and what guidance you would give them.  Is it possible to work with -- become allies or, you know, work with old battlefield adversaries?  How -- how do you look..."
"SEC. MATTIS:  Right, yes."
Q:  ... At a situation like that in Iraq?
"SEC. MATTIS:  Well first, all wars eventually come to an end.  I mean, by 1948, '49, after the vicious World War II, the Pacific Island Campaign was as vicious a fighting between two nations that's ever been in history.  We all know what Germany did during World War II with death camps, with invasions across Europe."
"And yet, by 1948, '49, we were standing up NATO to defend Western Europe and we were working with Germany.  The Marshall Plan was underway.  We were working with Japan.  Japan and Germany today, Germany under the NATO Treaty, Japan under a treaty -- our treaty allies."
"So, of course -- I mean, history tells us that all wars eventually end and the decisions you take following a war, comparing the United States leadership after World War II versus what came out of Versailles after World War One, can set the conditions for the future.  In this particular case first we'll have to see who is going to be the prime minister, because no party -- no coalition won enough to govern on its own."
"But it was interesting, wasn't it, that in the midst of everything going on next door in Syria, having recently destroyed ISIS strongholds in Iraq -- they're still isolated cells of them of course.  After all that's going on with the Iranians exporting terror from Yemen to Bahrain, from Lebanon to their attempt to murder the Saudi ambassador in Washington, D.C. years ago -- a few years ago, in the midst of all that's happening there, none of us know who is going to win a Democratic election.  Low turnout unfortunately.  But not too low.  Sunnis combined with others to try to put together some kind of political position that would represent their interest.  Kurds doing the same up north."
"We'll have to see where it comes out, and see if this becomes a responsive government.  People in 1944 were told basically in five years we'll be serving alongside German troops and sending locomotives and railroad tracks to Germany, we would have laughed in your face, said that's not going to happen; this is a war to the death.  Damn near lost.  But that's exactly what we did."
"So wars rub the veneer off all of us and leave the passions really exposed, and now it's time for strategic thinking, for looking to the future, and determining how the Iraqi people can dictate their future, not external threats from Iran, not money from Iran, not internal threats from ISIS or other terrorists."
"Q:  Could this election have consequences for the U.S. presidency in Iraq? Is that something that you're concerned about, something that..."
"SEC. MATTIS:  No, I mean it's not something I'm concerned with.  We're there at the invitation of the Iraqi government.  I didn't see the U.S. troop presence as being a political issue.  Didn't seem to even get much attention.  A lot of attention on a lot of issues, but that one didn't seem to rise to the level of public interest."
"But at the same time, this is between our two governments and we'll see what government they end up with.  So we'll play that forward.  It's too early to tell."
Q:  Do you have time for -- to talk a little bit about North Korea?
"SEC. MATTIS:  Well, yes."
Q:  And what you're talking to the president about and whether or not this is actually going to happen with the goals...
"SEC. MATTIS:  Yeah, no -- on that one, you know, my job is to make certain there's options there, and I keep a high degree of confidentiality is what I advise the president with."
"But I would say that this has been diplomatically led, as we said.  I first said that in February of last year, 2017.  It's been diplomatically led, and you can see where it led us to."
"There were a lot of people doubted it and all, but like when we had the sending states get together in Vancouver, British Columbia -- those were the states that in 1950 sent troops under the U.N. mandate to the first Korean War.  Plus other nations there besides -- besides U.K., and France, and Colombia, and Thailand.  Also India and Italy were there. They were not U.N. members in 1950.  Obviously the Republic of Korea, South Korea, and Japan were there, were not there in 1950.  They all met in British Columbia the cohosted by the U.S secretary of state and the minister of foreign affairs in Canada.  And it was instant to listen to the diplomats.  It was all ministered in foreign affairs, not ministers of defense."
"And just to give you a flavor of it, for example after I brief on the (inaudible) situation, I was just there for the dinner, and then I left, and they were going to have a day-long conference the next day.  One of the European ministers said my country's capital is closer to Pyongyang than Seattle or Washington D.C.  That's why I'm here."
"So when you look at now for just then during our administration three unanimous security -- U.N. Security Council resolutions, how many times do you see China and Russia and France and U.S and Britain all voting on the same side, on the same issue?  Not often.  So if it diplomatically led effort.  I don't think there would have been anything that has come up that has surprised us.  Certainly not our intelligence community.  And so we’ll watch the diplomats, and our hopes will be with them."
Q:  I just got a follow up.
SEC. MATTIS:  This has got to probably be the last question.  I've got to go back to work here.
"Q:  (Inaudible), your counterpart in Japan, you've been meeting with him (inaudible).  You have some meetings coming up with him."
SEC. MATTIS:  We meet often.  We talk often.
"Q:  What is your message to him with this potential upcoming summit between North Korea and the president?  Where (inaudible) orders to allies in the Pacific.  We have more forces there than we do in South Korea.  But the summit is coming up, and there could be a kernel or a potentially deal there, and they won't have a seat at the table.  What are you telling your counterpart?"
"SEC. MATTIS:  A very close collaboration diplomatically, militarily.  We're in very close contact.  He comes to Washington, I -- as a matter of fact, my first trip actually before his time, but with his predecessor, my first trip after I came into the job in January, and February I was out into Korea, Seoul and Tokyo.  We keep very close collaboration with Tokyo, very close."
"And that's not just me.  That's also State Department.  That's our civic command.  But it took -- like you said, it's one of our oldest allies in the Pacific.  And it's a very close relationship on both current events and longer term events."
Well thanks for making time for this.  I guess you missed the air show because of me.
Q:  We still have a lot of driving out (inaudible).
Q:  Well yeah that's fine.
"SEC. MATTIS:  You locals, you get to see it.  You're not like some of us, you know."
STAFF:  That's nice.
"SEC. MATTIS:  Yeah, that's nice. It's good to do that down here.  You know anywhere west of the 100th meridian is heaven on Earth for me.  So I admire you all for being out here and for coming in to see me, and we'll see you probably again in Washington D.C."
Q:  You will yes.  Thank you so much for making times for these (inaudible).
"SEC. MATTIS:  Oh sure, yeah no problem."
"Q:  Yeah, thanks for that."
Q: Well congratulation on being the Tri Citian of the year.  That's quite awesome.
"SEC. MATTIS:  Oh no, no. I wasn't, I was there to recognize."
Q:  Oh.
"SEC. MATTIS:  I know -- because, yeah, this is aggravating.  I know and but the guy who did, I mean just wonderful, I mean build house -- Habitat for Humanity.  He's doing all this other stuff, and he just one of these hardworking blue collar guys.  He didn't even know what to say, because there was 900 people in the room. (Laughter.)"
Q:  That's huge.
"SEC. MATTIS:  And but he's just -- he's and a LDS guy, he's everything you want in just a man who just you know, what do you mean.  You know the old folks at the home don't have a bench to sit on while they're waiting for the bus, go out and build a bench themselves.  OK.  The guy -- guy who's just -- you know, one of those things that remind you who you're fighting for, you know?"
"Q:  All right, well come back out September 1st.  Wazoo's playing Wyoming."
SEC. MATTIS:  Is that right?
Q:  It should be a good game.
SEC. MATTIS:  I was born at Wazoo.
Q:  Nice.
SEC. MATTIS:  Thanks for coming out (inaudible).  I appreciate it.  We'll see you guys real soon.
Q:  Right.
Q:  All right.
"PERFORMING THE DUTIES OF DEPURTY SECRETARY OF DEFENSE DAVID L. NORQUIST:  Thank you, Secretary Esper, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, friends and family.  Welcome and thank you for being here today to welcome Staff Sergeant Travis Atkins to his rightful place in the Hall of Heroes. "
"I also want to offer a special welcome to the many soldiers that served with Travis, along with his father, Jack, an Army veteran; his mother, Elaine; and his son, Trevor, who I was lucky enough to spend some time with this morning.  It is an honor to be with you all today.  Thank you for your service and the sacrifices you have made for our nation.  "
"Today is special because today we reflect on the true meaning of courage, service and selflessness, and honor a rare person who embodied them.  "
"There are many valorous stories of combat but the Medal of Honor is special.  It is awarded only to the bravest among us.  Staff Sergeant Atkins is one of them.  We may use the term ""hero"" all the time, but there are heroes among the heroes.  And they are very rare. "
"Since the Medal of Honor's creation in 1861, of the tens of millions who have served in the U.S. military, less than 3,600 medals have been awarded, each after painstaking deliberation and consideration."
"These are people who, when presented with the option, chose others over themselves.  This award is about offering these special souls our reverence as a nation and as a military, and ensuring that the best among us -- their bravery, their sacrifice and their selflessness -- are never forgotten. "
"""Where does that courage and selflessness come from?""  We often ask ourselves.  It comes from a commitment to others, and to the mission. "
"For Travis, a curious self-directed, adventurous kid who loved everything from hunting and fishing to heavy metal, Schubert and Johnny Cash, civilian life just didn't do it for him, according to his father.  He was looking for more.  "
"And the military is where he found it, a world he loved so much that he even called basic training ""the best thing he had ever done.""  Hard-core. "
"Through service, Travis found a calling, a sense of purpose and a community that he was willing to give the ultimate sacrifice to defend.  As his fellow soldiers have described him, he was a strong, decisive leader who instinctively knew when to act and the right way to do it. "
"He was a leader with enormous courage and a strong sense of loyalty to his team.  As they tell it, it was his emotional stamina and abiding belief that they would be able to confront whatever challenge they would encounter, that gave others the confidence they needed to accomplish the mission.  He loved his soldiers, and they loved him. "
"As his father said, superior officers had talked to him about going from green to gold.  And he considered it.  But he really liked being out there in the field with his men, and he didn't want to give that up. "
"As his parents recounted, Travis thought a lot about those in his charge, coaching them, helping them grow and teaching them how to protect themselves and complete the mission.  He also inspired them to be better leaders and better people.  "
"As Roberto put it, ""Travis's legacy has solidified who I have become and what I do and give to others.""  "
"His willingness to sacrifice his life to protect those around him is fundamentally why we are all here: to protect each other and to protect our nation.  We may spend a lot of time talking about weapon systems, technologies and doctrine, but our most important asset is the individual soldier, sailor, airman and Marine, because when the rubber meets the road at the tip of the spear, it all comes down to the individual men and women: their bravery, courage, professionalism, sense of duty and selflessness, all of which was so remarkably exhibited by this great American."
"War has always been a human endeavor, and it is people like Travis that give us faith in our future.  His actions resonate across time and place, inspiring us and fortifying our trust in ourselves, in our humanity, in our military and in our nation.  Our nation is forever indebted to him, and this medal reflects the American people's understanding of a certain paradox: We only become truly great when we make ourselves the servants of others.  Travis was a truly great man."
"Jack, Elaine and Trevor, your son and father is the very definition of servant and hero.  This Nation is proud to call him one of our own.  Thank you."
(APPLAUSE)
"STAFF: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today. This afternoon, Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment Ellen Lord and Deputy Under Secretary for Policy David Trachtenberg will provide a Department of Defense update on"
Turkey's accepting of the Russian S-400 system and what that means for the F-35 program moving forward.
"The purpose of this briefing is to focus on the F-35 and Turkey, so please limit your questions to that. Both leaders have an opening statement and then we'll take your questions. We do have a hard stop at 3:30, so please be respectful with your questions so everyone will have a chance."
"Before we start, the department would like to offer our condolences for the individuals Turkey lost during an attack today. Our hearts go out to their friends and families during this difficult time and the U.S. reaffirms its commitments to support the government and the people of Turkey."
"UNDER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ELLEN LORD: Thank you, Mike. Thank you all for being here this afternoon. Last Friday, the United States learned that Turkey accepted delivery of a Russian S-400 air and missile defense system. I'm here today to highlight three things."
"One, the U.S. has full confidence in the F-35 program and supply chain. Two, the U.S. and other F-35 partners are aligned in this decision to suspend Turkey from the program and initiate the process to formally remove Turkey from the program. Three, as President Trump said in his statement today, the U.S. still values our strategic partnership with Turkey."
"The Department of Defense, and the U.S. government more broadly, have worked very hard to chart an alternative path that would enable Turkey to acquire air defense systems within NATO alliance standards for interoperability and still allow Turkey to remain within the F-35 partnership."
"The United States has been actively working with Turkey over the sale of the Patriot air and missile defense systems to satisfy its legitimate air defense needs. Since early 2017, when Turkey began publicly discussing its interests in the Russian-made S-400 system, all levels of the U.S. government have consistently communicated that the F-35 and the S-400 are incompatible."
"As other U.S. officials and I have clearly said, Turkey cannot field a Russian intelligence collection platform in proximity to where the F-35 program makes, repairs and houses the F-35. Much of the F-35's strength lies in its stealth capabilities, so the ability to detect those capabilities would jeopardize the long-term security of the F-35 program."
"We seek only to protect the long-term security of the F-35 program. In early June, the acting secretary of defense communicated to Minister Akar that unless Turkey canceled acceptance of this system, Turkey would be removed from the F-35 program in an orderly, respectful and deliberate manner."
"All actions to wind down were reversible and this was done to allow sufficient time for Turkish personnel associated with the F-35 program to be reassigned and depart the United States by July 31, 2019. Please understand we cannot answer any questions on the matters of intelligence."
"Turkey's purchase of the S-400 is inconsistent with its commitments to NATO and will have detrimental impact on Turkish interoperability with the alliance. Regardless of Turkey's decision to proceed with the procurement of the Russian system, the F-35 international partnership is strong and resilient."
"I have regularly engaged with our partners as we sought a better outcome and began charting a path forward without Turkey's participation in the program. Our partnership regrets that we have arrived at this moment, but I and the F-35 Joint Program Office will continue to engage fully with our F-35 partners as we work to expeditiously complete the unwinding of Turkey's participation in the partnership."
"We have been working in earnest to develop and implement changes to our supply base and supply chain to accommodate the potential for Turkish removal from the program. To bridge the gap initially to mitigate Turkey's removal, the program will use primarily U.S. sources for Turkey's work share, but this will gradually open up to program partners for first, second and third sources."
"Because of this planning, Turkey's removal from the F-35 program will have minimal impact on the larger F-35 partnership. We have also worked closely with our industry partners throughout this process and I have notified F-35 industry leaders of Turkey's suspension to ensure the supply chain continues to stay closely informed and involved."
"Turkey will certainly, and regrettably, lose jobs and future economic opportunities from this decision. It will no longer receive more than $9 billion in projected work share related to the F-35 over the life of the program."
Turkey made more than 900 parts for the F-35 and had been assigned more than $1 billion in industrial participation across 10 Turkish suppliers. All Turkish F-35 students and instructor pilots currently in the United States have firm plans to leave the country.
"Roughly 20 Turkish personnel at the Joint Program Office will no longer retain access to JPO spaces. These actions to remove Turkey from the F-35 program are intended to mitigate risks to the F-35 and are separate from any congressionally-mandated, Russia-related sanctions under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, or CAATSA. I will defer all CAATSA questions to my colleagues at the State Department."
"In closing, and before Deputy Under Secretary Trachtenberg speaks, let me reiterate that Turkey remains a close NATO ally and our military-to-military relationship remains strong. We continue to honor our commitment to ensure the safety of our NATO ally, and support missions benefiting regional security and stability. Thank you."
"DEPUTY UNDER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE DAVID TRACHTENBERG: Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you all for being here today. I will be brief in my comments."
"As Under Secretary Lord said, this is a rather unfortunate development and one the U.S. government has worked tirelessly to avoid. But let me be clear, the United States greatly values our strategic relationship with Turkey. That remains unchanged. As long-standing NATO allies, our relationship is multilayered and extends well beyond the F-35 partnership."
We will continue our extensive cooperation with Turkey across the entire spectrum of our security relationship. We have been clear and consistent that Turkey can choose to acquire the S-400 or the F-35. It cannot have both. Our decision to unwind Turkey's participation in the F-35 program is no surprise as our concerns have repeatedly been communicated to the Turkish government.
"Our reaction today is a specific response to a specific event. It is separate and distinct from the broader range of security interests where the United States and Turkey work together against common threats. Our military-to-military relationship remains strong. And we will continue to participate with Turkey in multilateral exercises to improve readiness and interoperability, including upcoming exercises in Georgia, Germany and Ukraine, as well as engage with Turkey on a broad range of NATO issues."
"While Turkey's decision is unfortunate, ensuring the security and integrity of the F-35 program and the capabilities it will provide to our partners remains our top priority. Thank you."
STAFF: We're going to start with Bob.
"Q: I've got a quick question for each of you. Secretary Lord, are the decisions you announced about suspension and the removal, are those reversible at this stage? And if I may ask a second question, on the policy question that you just described, the relationship with Turkey, Secretary Esper just yesterday said that he regrets that more broadly Turkey has been drifting away from the West."
I'm wondering if you can explain how Turkey can remain a partner with the United States in defense and deterrence of Russia when it's now going to be operating a Russian-made air defense?
"DEP. UNDER SEC. TRACHTENBERG: If I could take this second question first, I'll be happy to address that. All I would say to that is clearly, we have worked with Turkey for many years as a strategic partner, our military-to-military relationship, as I said in my opening statement, remains very strong."
We understand Turkey has legitimate security requirements. We have worked with Turkey repeatedly. We continue to train and exercise with Turkish forces. Turkey has been a member of the NATO alliance longer than I have been alive. It has been well over six decades. And Turkey has been a reliable strategic partner during that time.
"From a departmental perspective and a military-to-military relationship perspective, we expect to continue that relationship, to work both bilaterally and in a NATO context for the benefit of our security and for the benefit of the NATO alliance."
Q: But you're making it sound like the fact that they have these Russian air defenses doesn't really matter.
"DEP. UNDER SEC. TRACHTENBERG: Oh, it does matter, which is why we're taking the action we're taking."
Q: Your partnership continues?
"DEP. UNDER SEC. TRACHTENBERG: The partnership continues, our strategic partnership continues, but as I said, this is a specific response to a specific action."
Q: I asked for a question.
Q: I asked about whether it was reversible at this point.
UNDER SEC. LORD: At this point the Turks have made a decision. We have said that the F-35 and the S-400 are incompatible. We will work forward at this point to unwind the relationship.
STAFF: Tony.
"Q: Last July, Secretary Mattis warned the congressional committees that suspending Turkey from the program would have draconian consequences – you might have helped draft the letter, actually – but, 18 to 24 months to re-source parts, fifty or so planes being delayed."
What’s happened in the last year to mitigate those impacts?
UNDER SEC. LORD: We have worked on alternate sources for the over 900 parts. We have been working since 2018 on this. We are proceeding with a very orderly wind-down through March 2020 at this point. So we expect minimal impact to the program.
"Q: Can you quantify the financial burden -- the financial loss to Turkey, you said -- I think you said $9 billion going forward?"
"UNDER SEC. LORD: Nine billion we said over the life of the program they had, roughly $1 billion in commitments as we sit here today."
Q: Are those commitments going to be abrogated or are those going to be honored? That's a billion dollars of commitments.
UNDER SEC. LORD: We are winding down in March of 2020.
STAFF: Phil
Q: You said that the Turkish pilots and crews -- maintenance crews-- have a firm plan to leave the country. Could you give us a little more detail on that and tell us whether or not any of them asked for asylum in the United States? And then another question.
"UNDER SEC. LORD: Just all of the pilots knew that we had a July 31 deadline. I just spoke with Acting Secretary of the Air Force Donovan a little bit earlier this afternoon, and said we were moving forward to suspend Turkey from the program. All of the pilots and maintainers are being notified as we speak. That's as much information as I have now."
"Q: Okay. And then to you, sir. Could you let me know whether or not you heard anything from Turkey about what actions they may take in response to what they see as an unfair move by the United States?"
"DEP. UNDER SEC. TRACHTENBERG: Oh, I'm not going to speculate on what actions the Turks may or may not take. I will reiterate the fact that we have made the Turkish government aware at multiple levels on multiple occasions that a decision to procure the S-400 would have consequences with respect to the F-35 program."
Q: Would you be surprised if there was a reaction from Turkey?
"DEP. UNDER SEC. TRACHTENBERG: Again, I'm not going to speculate one way or the other."
"Q: Thank you. Ms. Lord, is the Defense Department concerned that any of the Turkish pilots or maintainers who have trained on the F-35 could end up being provided to the Russians by the Turks, including the Turkish pilot who has already returned to Turkey and been arrested?"
UNDER SEC. LORD: I'm not going to speculate on that.
"Q: Former NATO Ambassador Ivo Daalder said this is a major blow to the alliance. He also said it weakens the alliance. And you refer to inter-operability, he said they can no longer take part in the integrated air defense of NATO. Can you respond to that?"
"DEP. UNDER SEC. TRACHTENBERG: I think it's an unfortunate development, as we have both stated. And obviously the S-400 is incompatible. We would have preferred, of course, a different decision, but this was Turkey's decision to make. And just as it is our decision to respond to it as we see fit."
"Remember, our actions -- the actions that we are announcing here -- have been taken to preserve and protect the equities of -- of NATO and our partners in the F-35 program. So we will continue to act with that uppermost and foremost in our mind."
"Q: If -- if you could address that, Ms. Lord?"
UNDER SEC. LORD: I don't have anything to add.
"Q: Well, again, if they can no longer take part in integrated air defense, doesn't that weaken the alliance?"
DEP. UNDER SEC. TRACHTENBERG: I'll -- I'll stand by what I just said. I think -- I think we will continue to work with all of our NATO allies on -- on ways of making sure that the alliance -- that alliance security is preserved and protected to the maximum extent possible.
STAFF: Tom
"Q: I wanted to follow-up on comments both of you gave to us earlier when you first talked about the possible unwind. Secretary Lord, you said then all of the parts would be shifted by April. You just said March. Are you -- are you advancing it now to March, the replacement?"
"UNDER SEC. LORD: We said by end of March, I haven't changed that."
"Q: Oh, OK. And in regards to the training exercises that may take place in the future, at the last briefing you said that the F-35 would not be in any training exercises where the Turks were involved -- I'm paraphrasing slightly but that's what you all said -- because they would risk the capability of the stealth in it. Do you still stand by that?"
DEP. UNDER SEC. TRACHTENBERG: In -- I don't know that I said that. But that the -- I said that the F-35 would not -- would not take...
Q: Yes. I think -- I think the implication was because of -- once the S-400s are established that any exercises with the Turks in Turkey would not include the F-35.
"DEP. UNDER SEC. TRACHTENBERG: I know we have a number of exercises scheduled. We have been participating with the Turks in an exercise that just took place last month. But in terms of specific aircraft or -- or capabilities there, I'd have to take that and get back."
"STAFF: OK, guys. You're going to have to speed this up because we only have 10 minutes."
"So, Lucas."
Q: Should Turkey be allowed to remain in NATO?
DEP. UNDER SEC. TRACHTENBERG: That's a decision for the NATO -- for the NATO alliance. Turkey is a member of NATO; it's a longstanding member of NATO. It has adhered to NATO requirements and I'm -- I'm not going to say one way or the other what should or shouldn't happen. That's not for us here to -- to decide.
Q: Is the Patriot air defense system superior to the Russian S-400 air defense system?
"DEP. UNDER SEC. TRACHTENBERG: I'm not going to talk about specific capabilities and what is superior or what is inferior. I will tell you, it is clear that we have offered the Patriot to Turkey on multiple occasions."
"Q: Is it a better system though, overall?"
STAFF: Go ahead.
"Q: Two quick ones, did Turkey get its money back for the jets it's purchased and will the U.S. ban other stealthy planes, like the F-22 or B-2, from participating in exercises anywhere near Turkey?"
"UNDER SEC. LORD: We are discussing the specifics about the aircraft they have purchased so far, as we speak."
"DEP. UNDER SEC. TRACHTENBERG: And I think, the -- the second question -- the answer to the second question, I would have to take for the record and let you know because we are not focused on that right now."
STAFF: Tony (inaudible).
"Q: Ms. Lord, what is the role of contractor Lockheed Martin going to be during this process and will this delay the program?"
"UNDER SEC. LORD: We have worked extremely closely with both Lockheed Martin and Pratt & Whitney because they both have part of the supply chain in Turkey. And they are in lockstep with us, so they are just as involved as we are. And at this point in time, we see no delays to aircraft in the program if we work through the March 2020 date that we're projecting."
STAFF: (inaudible)?
"Q: Thank you. Two quick questions, what is the message you are sending to other countries who are planning to buy S-400 from Russia? And secondly, can you have major defense partnership with India, which is going ahead with its decision to buy S-400 from Russia?"
DEP. UNDER SEC. TRACHTENBERG: I think the message we are sending is that we want to make sure that other countries are not -- are not purchasing equipment that is designed to counter our sophisticated fifth-generation aircraft. And I think the -- the other message we're sending is that we are consistent in our approach on this.
Q: And on the major defense partnership with India?
DEP. UNDER SEC. TRACHTENBERG: The major defense partnership with India?
"Q: Can you have a major defense partnership with India, which is going ahead with a decision to buy S-400?"
"DEP. UNDER SEC. TRACHTENBERG: Our -- our defense partnership with India, I think, is strong and we're looking to make it ever stronger."
STAFF: Carla.
Q: Two quick questions. So you had said that the U.S. would continue to participate with Turkey in upcoming international exercises. Do any of these exercises involve air defense training? That's question number one.
And then a follow would be has the United States made alternative plans for its operations in Syria and Iraq because a lot of these jets use Turkish airspace to carry out these operations?
"DEP. UNDER SEC. TRACHTENBERG: Carla, I won't talk about the Syria and Iraq piece of this. Right now, we're focused on the F-35. And in terms of the exercises, I'll be happy to get back to you with the specifics in -- in more detail in terms of the kinds of capabilities that would be involved."
"Q: But if they do require air defense in that training, would -- would Turkey just not take part in that part?"
DEP. UNDER SEC. TRACHTENBERG: I would -- I would get back to you on that.
"STAFF: In the back, please?"
Q: Thank you. President Trump said a couple of times that it is unfair to cancel the delivery of the F-35 jets to Turkey. Why is the president and DOD are not looking eye to eye to -- on this issue?
DEP. UNDER SEC. TRACHTENBERG: I don't understand why we wouldn't be eye to eye. The president made a statement.  I think it is consistent with what we have announced.
"Q: He said that it is unfair to cancel the delivery of the F-35 -- over 100 F-35 jets to Turkey. Yesterday, he made a statement on camera. That's what I'm talking about."
DEP. UNDER SEC. TRACHTENBERG: The president also said Turkey would not get the F-35 and that is consistent with the policy that we are announcing.
STAFF: Right here?
Q: How about the unfair comments of the president? Do you have any comments on this?
"STAFF: Sir, I think he's addressed that. We're going to go right here."
"Q: So as you know, the European -- engine depot for the F-35 is still -- well it's supposed to be in Turkey. What are you doing to replace that capability and what other -- what other European country is going to get that?"
UNDER SEC. LORD: There is capacity in the two other European countries that have engine MRO&Us. I'll get back to you with the details on those.
"STAFF: Ma'am, go ahead."
"Q: Yes. With the U.S. and the ROK joint military exercise conducting next month again and then joint -- and, like, Ulchi-Freedom exercise, what is your schedule for?"
"DEP. UNDER SEC. TRACHTENBERG: I'm sorry, I didn't hear the full question."
"Q: Ulchi-Freedom exercise, U.S. and Korea -- South Korea in joint military exercise..."
DEP. UNDER SEC. TRACHTENBERG: ROK exercise?
Q: Yes.
DEP. UNDER SEC. TRACHTENBERG: I'll...
Q: Do you have any planned for next month?
STAFF: We're here to talk about Turkey and the F-35...
DEP. UNDER SEC. TRACHTENBERG: ... Yes.
STAFF: ... we can take that question and we'll get back to you.
DEP. UNDER SEC. TRACHTENBERG: Sure.
STAFF: Ryan.
"Q: In your -- any conversations with the Turkish counterparts leading up to this decision, were they still optimistic that this would not go forward?"
"DEP. UNDER SEC.. TRACHTENBERG: I certainly don't want to characterize one way or another that conversations that have taken place, other than to reiterate that we have had conversations at multiple levels with the Turkish government and -- and we've made our position crystal clear."
STAFF: T.M.
Q: Maybe you answered this question for Tony and I didn't quite understand it. How much more expensive will this make the program overall for the United States by shifting the supply chain?
UNDER SEC. LORD: The United States is spending between $500 million and $600 million in non-recurring engineering in order to shift the supply chain.
STAFF: Yep.
"Q: Is there an idea of when an announcement could be made about more details about the aircraft that are -- the over 100 aircraft that were committed to go to Turkey, about when that might come out -- the plan for that?"
UNDER SEC. LORD: We are working through that right now. I think your question is who might buy those and so forth. We are working through the spread of that right now. So I don't have a specific timeframe.
STAFF:  Jeff.
"Q: I just want to clarify, Ms. Lord, if Turkey gives back the S-400s today, does that mean they are eligible again to participate in the F-35 program?"
"UNDER SEC. LORD: I can't provide any insight into that, that would be conjecture."
"Q: OK, I just wanted to rephrase my question. Has Turkey provided any personnel or technology from the F-35 to Russia?"
UNDER SEC. LORD: I can't speculate.
STAFF: Marcus.
"Q: I know you said you can't talk about CAATSA but you have to deal with a lot of these companies who could be impacted by it. Are you able to say any concerns that these companies have expressed and any of those concerns, have you brought them into the interagency that's reviewing this?"
"UNDER SEC. LORD: We work closely with our defense industrial base and keep them apprised of everything we know, so we talk about all types of contingencies, but we've been extremely transparent I think on this."
"STAFF: We're going to go Ryan, then we're going to go here and we're going to end with you. Go ahead."
"Q: Just a quick follow up, ma’am, you said that all of the partners were aligned with this decision. Did they have to approve this decision, the partner nations involved in the program? Did that have to get approved by all of the other partners or was it a U.S. unilateral decision?"
UNDER SEC. LORD: We had a consensus on that. We've discussed it multiple times.
"Q: Yeah, I just wanted to get an update on where you left the Patriot sale with Turkey, whether Turkey ever formally rejected that and whether this decision to buy the S-400 and get it delivered will have any impact on other U.S. sales or potential sales in the future?"
"DEP. UNDER SEC. TRACHTENBERG: I can't speculate on what will happen in terms of other sales. As I've said, we've offered the Patriots to Turkey numerous times. If Turkey's interested in Patriots, they -- they -- they will let us know."
Q: Did they ever formally rejected the Patriots as an offer?
DEP. UNDER SEC. TRACHTENBERG: We've been back and forth multiple times with -- with the Turks on -- on that particular issue.
STAFF:  Tom.
"Q: I wanted to go back to the fact that Turkey will no longer be able to take part in integrated air defense system of NATO. In your opinion, does that strengthen NATO, weaken NATO or have no impact at all?"
"DEP. UNDER SEC. TRACHTENBERG: I think I -- I think I've addressed that as -- as part of my previous response, I think that ..."
Q: ... does it have any impact at all?
DEP. UNDER SEC. TRACHTENBERG: I don't want to speculate in terms of what's going to happen with respect to NATO's weakening or strengthening. All I -- my only point was that the decisions we were taking here are intended to strengthen the partners and our capabilities in an alliance context.
Q: ... (inaudible) member of the alliance not being able to take part in an air defense system. How can that not weaken the alliance?
DEP. UNDER SEC. TRACHTENBERG: I think I've addressed that.
"STAFF: (Inaudible) we're going to go ahead and end. Ma’am, do you have any closing remarks?"
UNDER SEC. LORD: Thank you. I'd just like to re-emphasize that the F-35 partnership remains strong and that Turkey is a strategic partner to the U.S. Thank you.
"STAFF: Sir, do you have anything you want to add?"
DEP. UNDER SEC. TRACHTENBERG: The only thing that I -- I would close with is just to reiterate the fact that the actions that we're -- have taken and I've announced here are specific responses to specific actions taken by the Turks. The strategic partnership where -- we have with Turkey remains and we will continue to work with the Turks wherever -- wherever we can for the benefit of our security and the NATO alliance. Thank you all for being here.
STAFF: Thank you for joining us. Have a great day.
